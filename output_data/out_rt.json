{"Look around you, Kuvar. If any of us were strong, we wouldn't be on this beach.": 1, "Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.": 1, "Or else what? You'll kill me? I already had to face that today.": 1, "Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city guard? The gate's closed.": 1, "Or else what? You don't scare me.": 1, "Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing.": 1, "Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away.": 1, "Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had.": 1, "Opportunities for what?": 1, "Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...": 1, "Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.": 1, "Ooohhhh, ahhhrrrghhhh... uuuuggghhh.": 1, "Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.": 1, "Ooohh... The things I could do now...": 1, "Oooh... pretty colors.": 1, "Or maybe her plan was to come back, but she was stuck here. We won't know until we find her.": 1, "Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed.": 1, "Oooh. Ahhh... Well... See, the thing is...": 1, "Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!": 1, "Ooof!": 1, "Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!": 1, "Ooh... This place really chills the blood, eh?": 1, "Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!": 1, "Ooh. That had to hurt.": 1, "Ooh, real tough, wagging your weapon around...": 1, "Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? A song? A summons? Wait, I know! A death threat written on the back of an Argonian concubine! Those are my favorite.": 1, "Ooh, now that one must have hurt!": 1, "Ooh, good. I was just starting to get bored.": 1, "Ooh, cocky.": 1, "Ooh! Listener! That tickles!": 1, "Onward, then.": 1, "Oooh. Time to kill?": 1, "Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead.": 1, "Or perhaps there's something you'd like to confess?": 1, "Or that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after their creators' disappearance.": 1, "Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though.": 1, "Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.": 1, "Others think they use them as payment to an even higher power... almost like a currency. A very strange currency.": 1, "Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction.": 1, "Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous.": 1, "Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.": 1, "Other than that, she wouldn't tell me anything.": 1, "Other than that, Solstheim is crawling with bandits and Reiklings, but that's to be expected living on the frontier like this.": 1, "Other than that, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.": 1, "Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down.": 1, "Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler.": 1, "Oslaf, please!": 1, "Orthjolf, for example. He'll tell you he means well, but believe me, he can't be trusted at all.": 1, "Orthjolf, I'm surprised!": 1, "Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man.": 1, "Originally owned by the Jarl of Riften back in the Second Era, it was a bit of a black mark on the Hold's history.": 1, "Orgnar.": 1, "Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here.": 1, "Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?": 1, "Orgnar!": 1, "Orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.": 1, "Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound.": 1, "Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.": 1, "Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing.": 1, "Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade.": 1, "Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.": 1, "Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west.": 1, "Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.": 1, "Or will your name be a curse to future generations?": 1, "Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?": 1, "Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.": 1, "Only, she was gone. Shipped away to another orphanage, or adopted, or... I didn't know what else to do, so I came back, hoping nobody noticed I left.": 1, "Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you.": 1, "Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.": 1, "Only Storn can reveal the secrets you asked about.": 1, "Only Paarthurnax, the master of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses.": 1, "Only I hear that's not quite how it happened. Secret organization, you see. No one to blame when homes are broken into, things stolen.": 1, "Onikaan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice.": 1, "One, two, three...": 1, "One, the riddle is most likely referring to these flat square stones.": 1, "One, I'm the best infiltrator this rathole of a Guild's got, so if you think you're here to replace me, you're dead wrong.": 1, "One way or the other, I'll get my money.": 1, "One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood.": 1, "One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.": 1, "One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?": 1, "One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.": 1, "One thing about living in Skyrim I could never stomach... all the damn vampires!": 1, "One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it.": 1, "Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.": 1, "One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.": 1, "One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse.": 1, "One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!": 1, "One side, comin' through!": 1, "One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn.": 1, "One person's trash is another's treasure. Don't be surprised if you find that gone...": 1, "One of you get in here! I could put all of you down!": 1, "One of those things has the key to this cage. If you get me out of here I'll help you slaughter the rest of those crows.": 1, "One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.": 1, "One of these days, we'll have to find you a good woman like my Olda.": 1, "One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead. ": 1, "One of these days he'll have to learn. ": 1, "One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land.": 1, "One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but...": 1, "One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called \"test of worthiness.\"": 1, "One step closer to my return.": 1, "Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.": 1, "Only a single spire remains. Be careful, I'm almost certain the final Keeper will be prepared for your assault.": 1, "Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.": 1, "Only when you're around. The rest of these fools I could do without.": 1, "Only what I've heard.": 1, "Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.": 1, "Only use the practice arrows.": 1, "Only twenty septims a bottle!": 1, "Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.": 1, "Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.": 1, "Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. Come. We will teach you a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.": 1, "Only thirty more pages and my next volume will be complete.": 1, "Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?": 1, "Only thing that stood out for me was Auriel's Bow. That's a powerful weapon, and I sure as Oblivion don't want the vampires to get hold of it.": 1, "Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.": 1, "Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!": 1, "Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.": 1, "Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment.": 1, "Only the most resilient of priests can do it this way... it takes years of practice to interpret the harmony.": 1, "Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?": 1, "Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.": 1, "Only five more to go! Now let's just hope something good happens when you hit the last one.": 1, "Only if I can help it.": 1, "Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.": 1, "Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.": 1, "Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.": 1, "Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.": 1, "Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.": 1, "Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.": 1, "Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.": 1, "Only that it happened. ": 1, "Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago.": 1, "Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.": 1, "Only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons...": 1, "Only one more door left.  Hurry up.": 1, "One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.": 1, "Otherwise, I don't have the faintest idea.": 1, "Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a stickler for details. Get it? \"Stick-ler.\" Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I slay me!": 1, "Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.": 1, "Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not.": 1, "Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man.": 1, "Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway.": 1, "Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me.": 1, "Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about.": 1, "Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise.": 1, "Pahlok joorre! Hin kah fen kos bonaar.": 1, "Pah. The gods have a place for killers. You can't carry the burden? You're weak.": 1, "Pah, your blood is foul.": 1, "Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude.": 1, "Pack your things and go.": 1, "Paaz. A fair answer.": 1, "Paarthurnax? That name is familiar... the legendary leader of the Greybeards? ": 1, "Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right.": 1, "Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years.": 1, "Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong.": 1, "Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.": 1, "Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to.": 1, "Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town.": 1, "Pa always says good men need few words.": 1, "Owning a farm does have its advantages.": 1, "Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood.": 1, "Ow... It hurts when I laugh. He he...": 1, "Ow! What did I do?": 1, "Ow! Cheap shot!": 1, "Over time, your powers will grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts.": 1, "Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way.": 1, "Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master.": 1, "Over here! Hurry!": 1, "Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.": 1, "Outta my way, stranger.": 1, "Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him...": 1, "Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again.": 1, "Pay a visit to the beast's last known contact. Do what you must to find where it's hiding now.": 1, "Pawn of Neloth!": 1, "Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.": 1, "Pavo and Gat are the only survivors.

Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.": 1, "Patience, were almost there.": 1, "Patience, sister. Patience.": 1, "Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it.": 1, "Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism.": 1, "Patience, boy.": 1, "Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn.": 1, "Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out.": 1, "Patience is for fools. When you are tired of looking over your shoulder, you'll pay me.": 1, "Pathetic.": 1, "Papa, I want to talk to you...": 1, "Pathetic!": 1, "Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.": 1, "Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.": 1, "Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.": 1, "Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.": 1, "Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.": 1, "Pardon me?": 1, "Pardon me.": 1, "Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?": 1, "Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?": 1, "Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that.": 1, "Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?": 1, "Parading around in that form won't do you any good here.": 1, "Papa, when can I go on my first hunt?": 1, "Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you.": 1, "Pathetic excuse for an elf...": 1, "Outsiders.

I need reinforcements!": 1, "Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl.": 1, "Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.": 1, "Our compassion compels us to destroy it.": 1, "Our journey's been quite rewarding so far.

I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times.": 1, "Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.": 1, "Our business?": 1, "Our business is done here.": 1, "Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.": 1, "Our bond is our strength.

No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group.": 1, "Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day.": 1, "Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.": 1, "Our Lord will be most pleased, I'm sure. I knew you could do it.": 1, "Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything.": 1, "Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed.": 1, "Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers.": 1, "Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace.": 1, "Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.": 1, "Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons.": 1, "Out. She owns the place, she does what she wants.": 1, "Out the way we came. Hurry!": 1, "Out of the way!": 1, "Out of our way.": 1, "Out of my way.

Deep.": 1, "Out of my way, kinsman.": 1, "Out of my sight! ": 1, "Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town.": 1, "Ours.

Perhaps Storn has been lost as well...": 1, "Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first bestowed the gift of the ancient blood upon me.": 1, "Our secret ingredient, if you will. ": 1, "Otherwise, all I can do now is grant you my hopes for a safe journey.": 1, "Our sense of what's right is what separates us from the vampires. Don't forget that.": 1, "Our son Leontius moved to Old Hroldan nearly 30 years ago. I still miss him.": 1, "Our son joining the Stormcloaks. If this war had never happened, Cade would have joined the Imperial Legion, like grandfather.": 1, "Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.": 1, "Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.": 1, "Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone...": 1, "Our traditions do not speak of them. But they and Miraak are connected. You read a Black Book, and saw him.": 1, "Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat.": 1, "Pay attention, you could learn something.": 1, "One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air.": 1, "One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly. ": 1, "Okay, got another one for you.": 1, "Okay, I'll go now.": 1, "Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up.

And what is her name, this secret wife of yours?": 1, "Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion.": 1, "Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that.": 1, "Oh... what a terrible shame. Well, if you think you know where you left it and can retrieve it, I'll be here.": 1, "Oh... well... of course they'd disavow all knowledge... spies are everywhere.": 1, "Oh... well... I can see you have no appreciation for scholarship.": 1, "Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.": 1, "Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might...": 1, "Oh... perhaps not, then. I don't think the Jarl of Solitude should be participating in a childish prank.": 1, "Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know.": 1, "Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke.": 1, "Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex.": 1, "Olaf grabbed power, by promise and threat; ": 1, "Olaf gave orders, Winterhold disguises. An attack on Solitude total destruction to follow.": 1, "Olaf captured a fast-sleeping dragon, a mighty feat which the meek would not fail.": 1, "Okay?

I'll just be on my way, then...": 1, "Okay.": 1, "Okay, well... I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge.": 1, "Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?": 1, "Okay, there you go.": 1, "Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. \"Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl.

Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time...": 1, "Okay, okay!": 1, "Okay, now where did I put those spiders?": 1, "Okay, now don't move at all.": 1, "Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you.": 1, "Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man.": 1, "Okay, let's head into the portal.": 1, "Okay, okay. You've talked me into it.": 1, "Oh... not at the moment. Maybe later. Don't go far.": 1, "Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...": 1, "Oh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka.": 1, "Oh. Is that all? Really? ": 1, "Oh. Is it your... first time?": 1, "Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!": 1, "Oh. I... I see.": 1, "Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway.": 1, "Oh. I didn't even know. What kind of woman is she?": 1, "Oh. I didn't even know. What kind of man is he?": 1, "Oh. I didn't even know. Is it a happy home?": 1, "Oh. Good.": 1, "Oh. Good job. Here... My way of saying thanks.": 1, "Oh. For some reason I didn't realize you were the same person all the stories were about...": 1, "Oh.

All right.": 1, "Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?": 1, "Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it.": 1, "Oh, you old charmer.": 1, "Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget.": 1, "Oh, you know.

I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.": 1, "Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea.": 1, "Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment.": 1, "Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly.": 1, "Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.": 1, "Regardless, I hope to return there someday... which doesn't seem likely given my husband's commitment to Councilor Morvayn.": 1, "Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.": 1, "References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.": 1, "Reeaaaallllyyyy?": 1, "Redoran-following dog!": 1, "Redgrass?": 1, "Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.": 1, "Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.": 1, "Red Mountain dominates the island. Every now and then ash and debris from an eruption land on our shores.": 1, "Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named \"The Pride of Tel Vos,\" but that's where the trail ran cold.": 1, "Reburrus, there is a war being fought across all of Skyrim, and you bother me with the usual mundane reports about silver?": 1, "Really? Now that is interesting...": 1, "Reburrus, I need you to draft a letter to Ulfric requesting more men.": 1, "Really? You're certainly... forthright about your criminal past.": 1, "Really? You mean it? Wow, thanks, Pa! I promise, I won't be any trouble at all!": 1, "Really? You mean it? Wow, thanks, Ma! I promise, I won't be any trouble at all!": 1, "Really? You had to take the armor? Come on, leave me with a little dignity...": 1, "Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?": 1, "Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier.": 1, "Really? When this is over, you'll have to tell me all about it.": 1, "Really? Well, now, that make things easier...": 1, "Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation.": 1, "Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?": 1, "Really? That would be kind of you.": 1, "Really? That would be a pleasant change.": 1, "Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.": 1, "Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?": 1, "Reason, reason, reason. Your kind and their reasons.": 1, "Rather convincing, don't you think?": 1, "Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.": 1, "Rare trinkets and the finest oddities from Morrowind!": 1, "Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?": 1, "Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's.": 1, "Quiet! I think I heard something.": 1, "Quiet down.": 1, "Quiet again.": 1, "Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.": 1, "Quicksilver Mine is the best mine in Dawnstar, and you can tell those Iron-Breaker miners I said so.": 1, "Quickly, this way.": 1, "Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother...": 1, "Quickly, follow me!": 1, "Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!": 1, "Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!": 1, "Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?": 1, "Quickly now! The longer you delay, the more danger the Jarl is in.": 1, "Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.": 1, "Quick, the bow!": 1, "Questions? I expected as much.": 1, "Qoth...Zaam!": 1, "Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should.": 1, "Qiilaan us dilon!": 1, "Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?": 1, "Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?": 1, "Put your weapon away.": 1, "Put up a real fight!": 1, "Put that thing away, or get out.": 1, "Put that thing away before someone gets hurt!": 1, "Put that down.": 1, "Put on some damn clothes already!": 1, "Put on some clothes, you damned fool.": 1, "Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...": 1, "Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep.": 1, "Quite a climb, wasn't it?": 1, "Quite a place, huh? Was even more impressive before it all fell to pieces.": 1, "Quite a while ago, yes. They cut a bloody swath across most of the southern region of Morrowind.": 1, "Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck.": 1, "Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet.": 1, "Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend.": 1, "Ran off, I suppose.": 1, "Ran away, I guess.": 1, "Ralof? How do you know him?": 1, "Ralof... get away from there, fool!": 1, "Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man.": 1, "Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!": 1, "Ralof! What are you doing here? Ah... I'll be right down.": 1, "Ralof of Riverwood.": 1, "Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.": 1, "Raise the alarm! We've been infiltrated!": 1, "Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe.": 1, "Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.": 1, "Raerek, how is The Reach faring against this Forsworn menace?": 1, "Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe.": 1, "Quite bold, to return here as a mortal. Some will take offense.": 1, "Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it.": 1, "Quite right! Quite right! This, however, is paying work. Allow me to explain.": 1, "Quite so.": 1, "Quite the opposite, in fact.": 1, "Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it.": 1, "Put an end to this evil magic before it consumes us all.": 1, "Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination.": 1, "Raaa fay.": 1, "Raaarr!": 1, "Raagh!": 1, "Raarrgh!": 1, "Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we get business.": 1, "Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we...": 1, "Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.": 1, "Pay him? Why?": 1, "Please, stranger! I need your help!": 1, "Please, stop wasting my time. You're embarrassing yourself.": 1, "Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind.": 1, "Perhaps, but necessary. My cousin, Fura, is somewhere out there in Skyrim right now, fighting Ulfric Stormcloak and his damned insurrectionists.": 1, "Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir.": 1, "Perhaps, but it just means more work for me.": 1, "Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it.": 1, "Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?": 1, "Perhaps you'd care to put your weapon away? Hmm?": 1, "Perhaps you will prove clever enough to uncover the secrets hidden here. If so, welcome.": 1, "Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power!": 1, "Perhaps you should. I count some of the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim among the members of my court.": 1, "Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.": 1, "Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.": 1, "Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer.": 1, "Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?": 1, "Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need.": 1, "Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah.": 1, "Perhaps when you're finished here this evening, we could...": 1, "Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.": 1, "Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...": 1, "Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.": 1, "Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?": 1, "Perhaps this world is simply the Egg of the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?": 1, "Perhaps this particular source was worth more than I thought he was. Pity. ": 1, "Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.": 1, "Perhaps they'll never return to their former appearance, but over the centuries, I've noticed a rise in their intellect.": 1, "Perhaps they were once corporeal beings, but they've obviously reached a point where they no longer require a tangible presence.": 1, "Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce.": 1, "Perhaps these will prove useful to you. These herbs are unique to the island, and their like cannot be found elsewhere.": 1, "Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?": 1, "Perhaps there's enough undamaged text in these etchings to tell us the combination.": 1, "Perhaps you are a fool or a coward. If so, you are in peril. Read your book again and escape before Apocrypha claims you forever.": 1, "Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.": 1, "Perhaps. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.": 1, "Perhaps. But not today.": 1, "Pirates, you see.": 1, "Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town.": 1, "Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal.": 1, "Picking through garbage. Has she no shame?": 1, "Picking through garbage. Has he no shame?": 1, "Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?": 1, "Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin.": 1, "Pick one of the others. I'll be fine.": 1, "Pick me! Pick me!": 1, "Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal.": 1, "Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school.": 1, "Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre.": 1, "Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.": 1, "Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.": 1, "Perhaps. But he spoke of this \"curse\" to you, which means it has deeply affected him.": 1, "Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should.": 1, "Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has.": 1, "Petra, you traitorous grouse! Die!": 1, "Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!": 1, "Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat.": 1, "Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful.": 1, "Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here.": 1, "Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water.": 1, "Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?": 1, "Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath.": 1, "Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men...": 1, "Perhaps... ": 1, "Perhaps. Perhaps not.": 1, "Perhaps. Do you have a way out of here?": 1, "Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?": 1, "Pfft": 1, "Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.": 1, "Perhaps that's reassuring enough for you, but it's something that still keeps me awake at night.": 1, "Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.": 1, "Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest.": 1, "Performing the Ritual of the Ancestor Moth within the glade should provide the answers you seek.": 1, "Perfect. This should do it.": 1, "Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.": 1, "Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.": 1, "Perfect. Hopefully this will let us know more about their movement. I think we've got them on the run!": 1, "Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then.": 1, "Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while.": 1, "Perfect! I was just thinking about heading over for a drink. Thanks for saving me the trip.": 1, "Perfect! All that's left now is to go ahead and wait for the patrons to come in.": 1, "People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone.": 1, "People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then.": 1, "People think they can run away from their crimes, but I will always catch up with them and make them pay. ": 1, "People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know.": 1, "Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.": 1, "People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence.": 1, "People have mentioned it's a bit odd about how close in age Mirri appears to be to her father, but that's hardly a cause for alarm.": 1, "People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life.": 1, "People don't usually sail over there unless they have a particular reason. It can be a pretty rough place.": 1, "People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos.": 1, "Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.": 1, "Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!": 1, "Peeeee fa!": 1, "Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood.": 1, "Peace, and a warm drink.": 1, "Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!": 1, "Peace at last...": 1, "Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.": 1, "Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers.": 1, "Pay your dues and we'll speak.": 1, "People laugh at things they don't believe. It helps them accept the unknown.": 1, "Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.": 1, "Perhaps I'll be the first Skaal to slay a dragon. That would be worthy of a tale!": 1, "Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done.": 1, "Perhaps something is meant to go into the fire. But what could it be? Something that's already nearby, perhaps?": 1, "Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.": 1, "Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me.": 1, "Perhaps someday I will have to, but for now I need Nikulas here. You see, his father, my husband, was recently lost to us.": 1, "Perhaps some other time.": 1, "Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.": 1, "Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did.": 1, "Perhaps our town isn't as grand as Mournhold, but it's our home and we must make the most of it.": 1, "Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.": 1, "Perhaps one of them will want to learn the ways of iron-shaping.": 1, "Perhaps one day, but not today.": 1, "Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!": 1, "Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time.": 1, "Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.": 1, "Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?": 1, "Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting.": 1, "Perhaps later. For now I have a slightly more personal request.": 1, "Perhaps I'll need some rope. Oh, who am I trying to fool? At my age, I'll be lucky if I can climb a steep set of stairs.": 1, "Perhaps Miraak was also a Dragon Priest, probably a contemporary of this guardian. He must have turned against his own order.": 1, "Perhaps Storn can make sense of what is going on.": 1, "Perhaps a different form of attack will yield better results.": 1, "Perhaps a little harder?": 1, "Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.": 1, "Piss off. I'm busy.": 1, "Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.": 1, "Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund.": 1, "Perhaps if he had spent more time with us, he would have recognized the beauty for himself.": 1, "Perhaps it has some relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected.": 1, "Perhaps it was nothing after all.": 1, "Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.": 1, "Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?": 1, "Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key.": 1, "Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!": 1, "Pitiful sorcery. You'll not stay hidden long.": 1, "Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.": 1, "Please, just let me be...": 1, "Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life.": 1, "Please, help yourself to more wine.": 1, "Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you.": 1, "Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds.": 1, "Please, he's such a loyal creature, and he's been running for so long. You have to save him! A place like this will change you...": 1, "Please, go speak to the second councilor as soon as possible.": 1, "Please, go right ahead. I have plenty to occupy me for the moment.": 1, "Please, get word to my mother.": 1, "Please, get that to Avulstein right away.": 1, "Please, get me out of here!": 1, "Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College.": 1, "Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away.": 1, "Please, enough already!": 1, "Please, just let me handle it. It's not a problem.": 1, "Please, enjoy yourself!": 1, "Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.": 1, "Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!": 1, "Please, do you have a potion you can spare?": 1, "Please, do not let Ancarion make his weapons. Kill him or let him live, but take the map from him. It belongs with the Skaal.": 1, "Please, do not distract us. This barrier must be maintained at all costs.": 1, "Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want.": 1, "Please, cut me down!": 1, "Please, come home. Just... Just come home.": 1, "Please, come back and speak to me anytime.": 1, "Please, carry on.": 1, "Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance.": 1, "Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald...": 1, "Please, Listener. Release my soul, and let Sithis be the judge.": 1, "Please, I'm starving. Any help will do...": 1, "Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!": 1, "Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!": 1, "Please, just... just leave me be!": 1, "Please, lead on.": 1, "Please, someone, help me!": 1, "Please, someone help me!": 1, "Please, sir, leave me alone!": 1, "Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it...": 1, "Please, please... hold all your questions until after I've finished!": 1, "Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?": 1, "Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.": 1, "Please, please let me out of here!": 1, "Please, our tribe suffers and we need help.": 1, "Please, open the door. I need to get out of here.": 1, "Please, oh please, I don't want to die...": 1, "Please, oh hero of Skyrim. Please find Varona. I shall be ever so grateful.": 1, "Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!": 1, "Please, mister. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.": 1, "Please, lady. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.": 1, "Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!": 1, "Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!": 1, "Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again.": 1, "Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go...": 1, "Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!": 1, "Please, let's speak privately.": 1, "Please, let's not have it come to that.": 1, "Please, let's hurry. I need to get home so I can figure out what's happened.": 1, "Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again.": 1, "Please, let me out of here!": 1, "Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside.": 1, "Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave.": 1, "Please, leave us. We must concentrate.": 1, "Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies.": 1, "Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself.": 1, "Please, make yourself at home!": 1, "Please, I need help! I don't want to die on this damned log!": 1, "Please, I don't wish to be disturbed while I'm meditating.": 1, "Please, I don't have anything to eat.": 1, "Please help me, I'm going to lose my job at the Riften Fishery.": 1, "Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.": 1, "Please give me a chance to try again.": 1, "Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with the death of my wife and daughters...": 1, "Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death.": 1, "Please forgive my earlier rudeness. I am so often interrupted by visitors wandering in, I can occasionally become quite savage.": 1, "Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.": 1, "Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.": 1, "Please excuse the mess.": 1, "Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.": 1, "Please don't leave. You must help me.": 1, "Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.": 1, "Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.": 1, "Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.": 1, "Please help me, I'm starving.": 1, "Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.": 1, "Please do let me know if you change your mind.": 1, "Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.": 1, "Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death.": 1, "Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard.": 1, "Please accept this as a token of gratitude. Once again, you've proven yourself an ally to the Skaal.": 1, "Pleasant journey, serjo.": 1, "Playing tonight, Ogmund? Everyone here is anxious to hear the old ballads performed by the True Skald of the Reach.": 1, "Planning some exciting heists I hope?": 1, "Plan on burning everything down, do you? Damn fool.": 1, "Places where you can overhear things. See things.": 1, "Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it.": 1, "Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.": 1, "Place is named after her. \"Warmaiden's.\" It's a childhood nickname, given by her father. What I hear, she was playing with swords even back then.": 1, "Pity.": 1, "Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.": 1, "Please help. I can pay you.": 1, "Please hold still, and don't move.": 1, "Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.": 1, "Please, I can't... Just... just go.": 1, "Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!": 1, "Please! You've got to get me out of here before she comes back.": 1, "Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...": 1, "Please! Release me! Cut my bonds!": 1, "Please! Keep that magic away from me.": 1, "Please! I'm not sure I'll make it on my own.": 1, "Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!": 1, "Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away?": 1, "Please! Help me!": 1, "Please! Help me get out of this cage. I don't know why those things locked me up and I don't want to wait around to find out.": 1, "Please! Don't hurt me again!": 1, "Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara.": 1, "Please tell me you have news of my son.": 1, "Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...": 1, "Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.": 1, "Please take the Lexicon.": 1, "Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!": 1, "Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim.": 1, "Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there...": 1, "Please hurry. We are counting on you.": 1, "Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.": 1, "Please make sure your hands are clean before touching anything, all right?": 1, "Pitiful. Simply pitiful. I expected more from the defiant fool that beguiled my daughter.": 1, "Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?": 1, "Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?": 1, "Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.": 1, "Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.": 1, "Please remain calm!": 1, "Please step back, there's an execution in process.": 1, "Please stop looking at me like that.": 1, "Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.": 1, "Relax, hero. She's fine. At least she was. The chief liked her so much, she took her back home. Here's a letter for you.": 1, "Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear.": 1, "Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other.": 1, "Now, on to the business at hand...": 1, "Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?": 1, "Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?": 1, "Now, now... no need for weapons.": 1, "Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel.": 1, "Now, now, my friend. You must look on the bright side. If soldiers storm the city, there's a good chance your husband may get killed.": 1, "Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics.": 1, "Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands.": 1, "Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?": 1, "Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it.": 1, "Now, make your choice!": 1, "Now, look... I understand you were just defending yourself. And because you helped us retake the hall, I'll look past it this once.": 1, "Now, listen to my words and do as I instruct.": 1, "Now, lets see if we can find the other half of that claw.": 1, "Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as Argonian, but as dovah!": 1, "Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?": 1, "Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?": 1, "Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.": 1, "Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions.": 1, "Now, let's get you the Elder Scroll and you can be on your way.": 1, "Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.": 1, "Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more.": 1, "Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.": 1, "Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...": 1, "Now, let me get the scroll's case opened.": 1, "Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly doesn't belong here.": 1, "Now, it's only a rumor of a whisper of a conjecture. But I think this is the place.": 1, "Now, is lavender an herb or a poison? Hmm....": 1, "Now, if, um... you'll get going?": 1, "Now, if you're here on his behalf, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on my original payment.": 1, "Now, let's see what there is to see.": 1, "Now, if you're going to get those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.": 1, "Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as elf, but as dovah!": 1, "Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!": 1, "Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice.": 1, "Now, you be careful with the creature.": 1, "Now, you are going to speak to this... Monk... and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds.": 1, "Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?": 1, "Now, what's he's asking, it's just impossible. Even if it worked, the questions and accusations it would cause...": 1, "Now, what is our Lord's wish?": 1, "Now, what is it you want?": 1, "Now, what do you all say?": 1, "Now, what can I do for young Morwen?": 1, "Now, we're barely holding on out here. Without the mine, Raven Rock doesn't feel like it can last much longer.": 1, "Now, we begin the ritual...": 1, "Now, volume two begins! What else?": 1, "Now, to prove yourself to me, I have a task for you. Take my axe, and deliver it to the Jarl of Whiterun.": 1, "Now, this Chalice needs to be filled directly from the bloodspring that is the source of Redwater Den. But that's not enough.": 1, "Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as khajiit, but as dovah!": 1, "Now, they're old, and they're powerful. A combination like that makes them pretty valuable to certain people, and I happen to know certain people.": 1, "Now, there's no need to do anything rash...": 1, "Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do.": 1, "Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?": 1, "Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?": 1, "Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one.": 1, "Now, that's it. One free outfit per soldier. You lose that, or get it banged up, you'll need to pay like everyone else.": 1, "Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark.": 1, "Now, take this for your efforts, and we'll call the matter closed.": 1, "Now, take a deep breath.": 1, "Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape.": 1, "Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.": 1, "Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.": 1, "Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.": 1, "Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as orc, but as dovah!": 1, "Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people.": 1, "Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters.": 1, "Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful. ": 1, "Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go.": 1, "Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use...": 1, "Now, I know what you're thinking - this is no spoon, it's a fork! Nobody can eat soup with a fork!": 1, "Now, I have a soul in Oblivion to claim. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!": 1, "Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!": 1, "Now, I believe that Lord Harkon wishes to speak with you.": 1, "Now, I believe I owe you a little more than a debt of gratitude for all that work you did.": 1, "Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can.": 1, "Now, Dovahkiin! Now he is vulnerable!": 1, "Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.": 1, "Now your blood is mine!": 1, "Now you. You can call me Ann Marie.": 1, "Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?": 1, "Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone...": 1, "Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?": 1, "Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold.": 1, "Now you're talking.": 1, "Now you're speaking my language.": 1, "Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.": 1, "Now you're one of us.": 1, "Now you're just making me mad.": 1, "Now you're going to pay!": 1, "Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.": 1, "Now you're finally talking some sense. A mining tool belongs in a mining family.": 1, "Now you're beginning to see why I wanted to protect Serana, and why I've kept the other Elder Scroll as far from her as possible.": 1, "Now you'll pay!": 1, "Now you'll learn the folly of your mistake!": 1, "Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?": 1, "Now you suffer!": 1, "Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!": 1, "Now you people dictate everything we do. Don't want us acknowledging a \"mere human\" like Talos as the god he is.": 1, "Now you're starting to sound like everyone else.": 1, "Now, I need to be alone.": 1, "Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know.": 1, "Now, I'll have to go recruit some more miners... it won't be easy, seeing as none of their friends came back from the first attempt.": 1, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to meditate a bit.": 1, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest.": 1, "Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.": 1, "Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath.": 1, "Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate.": 1, "Now, if I'm not mistaken. Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you.": 1, "Now, hurry. That book might contain the final secrets of Xarxes, for all we know.": 1, "Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties? ": 1, "Now, go away.": 1, "Now, give me one good reason that I should not kill you where you stand.": 1, "Now, get of my way.": 1, "Now, empty your pockets or I'll pick the gold off your corpse.": 1, "Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.": 1, "Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus.": 1, "Now, do you require assistance?": 1, "Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?": 1, "Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!": 1, "Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day. ": 1, "Now, I'm not sure if you can read the dragon language, but this seems to be a riddle of some sort.": 1, "Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?": 1, "Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost...": 1, "Now, I...": 1, "Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in.": 1, "Now, you don't let Rogatus cause you any bother.": 1, "Now, acknowledge me as your master!": 1, "Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.": 1, "Now, by law and tradition, I can only grant the title to one who is known throughout Eastmarch, and who owns property in Windhelm.": 1, "Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up.": 1, "Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting.": 1, "Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence.": 1, "Now, did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?": 1, "Now, are you ready to try again? I am confident it will work this time.": 1, "Now you let me know if you need a cure... or anything else.": 1, "Now, you might already know that Molag Bal is the original source of vampirism.": 1, "Now, you try it Aia": 1, "Of course! Let's go.": 1, "Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research.": 1, "Of course! It is my duty to serve, and I am happy to do it!": 1, "Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.": 1, "Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.": 1, "Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?": 1, "Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all.": 1, "Of course! I mean... assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.": 1, "Of course! I know, today wasn't the best introduction to the Legion, but I hope you'll give us another chance.": 1, "Of course! I don't even want to hear the word \"barrow\" again. Ever.": 1, "Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.": 1, "Of course!": 1, "Of course you will.": 1, "Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.": 1, "Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me.": 1, "Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.": 1, "Of course you do.": 1, "Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly.": 1, "Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!": 1, "Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?": 1, "Of course this was before your briarheart expedition. Now I know that I did the surgery all wrong.": 1, "Of course this is all just theory and conjecture. It is likely we will never know the truth.": 1, "Of course they have! I've made no secret of my loyalty to the Empire. I'm no coward.": 1, "Of course they don't count!": 1, "Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent.": 1, "Of course they did. I never doubted for a moment.": 1, "Of course there's a collapse in trade, Raerek. The Stormcloaks stalk every road and harass every one of our patrols.": 1, "Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.": 1, "Of course there are. Most of us spend our lives as nomads, traveling from place to place in our endless war against evil.": 1, "Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all.": 1, "Of course you have.": 1, "Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder. ": 1, "Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!": 1, "Of course, Elder. Please forgive me.": 1, "Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though.": 1, "Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!": 1, "Of course, the creature will have to be dead first, but I trust that's something you can... bring about.": 1, "Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?": 1, "Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.": 1, "Of course, on further reflection, that may have simply been an attempt to scare me. Hmm.": 1, "Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it.": 1, "Of course, my lord.": 1, "Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned.": 1, "Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert.": 1, "Of course, my dear. All will be well now.": 1, "Of course, mum.": 1, "Of course, master.": 1, "Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool.": 1, "Of course, Cindiri. What troubles you?": 1, "Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale.": 1, "Of course, here. Be well.": 1, "Of course, here you are.": 1, "Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well.": 1, "Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind.": 1, "Of course, Listener. What is it?": 1, "Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?": 1, "Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant.": 1, "Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor.": 1, "Of course, I'm sure you can handle yourself. Of course you can. Of course.": 1, "Of course, I wouldn't be telling you where to find them if I desired them for myself.": 1, "Of course, I wouldn't be telling you where to find it if I desired it for myself.": 1, "Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to \"acquire\" things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty, now can we?": 1, "Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.": 1, "Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out.": 1, "Of course, if you've got any more adventures planned...": 1, "Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are... rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's... intimate.": 1, "Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods....": 1, "Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?": 1, "Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.": 1, "Obey our laws, or suffer the consequences.": 1, "Oaf.": 1, "OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count.": 1, "OK, let's see what you can do.": 1, "O, Olaf, our subjugator, the one-eyed betrayer;": 1, "Nyyahh!": 1, "Nyuuu... waaa...": 1, "Nust wo ni qiilaan fen kos duaan.": 1, "Nuruk!": 1, "Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting.": 1, "Now? I announce to all of Markarth that I have returned. Don't worry about your name. They'll know who to blame and fear after today.": 1, "Now... you'd be lucky to find a single room intact.": 1, "Now... what did you say you wanted?": 1, "Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone.": 1, "Now... now you'll let me go. Right?": 1, "Now... my prey awaits. Good hunting to you.": 1, "Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?": 1, "Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.": 1, "Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.": 1, "Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.": 1, "Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?": 1, "Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.": 1, "Now. We really must be going, sir.": 1, "Now. I'm certain Adril was prepared to reward you appropriately for everything you've done.": 1, "Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.": 1, "Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.": 1, "Now, you. Get down there.": 1, "Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice.": 1, "Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation.": 1, "Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?": 1, "Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!": 1, "Oblivion take you!": 1, "Observing and capturing the epic struggle for Skyrim! When brothers clash with bitter blades, surely there is a song to be found.": 1, "Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.": 1, "Of course not. My spirit remains strong.": 1, "Of course not. My mistake.": 1, "Of course not. I never thought otherwise.": 1, "Of course not. He's an elf, isn't he?": 1, "Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.": 1, "Of course it matters to you, but you don't get to make this decision for me.": 1, "Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven. ": 1, "Of course it bothers me! I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they seize our mill in the name of their war effort.": 1, "Of course he will.": 1, "Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?": 1, "Of course he does. What sort of a question is that?": 1, "Of course he does have a knack for wards that would be handy to learn.": 1, "Of course he did.": 1, "Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.": 1, "Of course I'm troubled. I'm on the verge of incredible wealth, but my cowardly work force ran at the first sign of danger.": 1, "Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the words aloud?": 1, "Obviously not, or you would have a cup of tea in your hands.": 1, "Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it.": 1, "Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus.": 1, "Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel.": 1, "Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't.": 1, "Odds and ends I've gathered over the years. Well, used to gather before all of this nonsense happened to me.": 1, "Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started.": 1, "Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you.": 1, "Of course I am. What brings you here?": 1, "Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?": 1, "Of course I did.": 1, "Of course I do. If I didn't, most of these books would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era.": 1, "Of course I do. What do you want?": 1, "Of course I'm certain.": 1, "Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good.": 1, "Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe.": 1, "Now you just tell me if you need something.": 1, "Now you decide to give up? Fine. I'll be here.": 1, "Now I'm trying to reestablish the Dawnguard. Take the fight to the vampires for a change. I hope it isn't too late.": 1, "Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.": 1, "Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.": 1, "Now I'm going to have to kill you!": 1, "Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly.": 1, "Now I think I'll spend some more time studying this word wall. What a book this will make!": 1, "Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.": 1, "Now I just have to figure how to get this thing started...": 1, "Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine.": 1, "Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!": 1, "Nothing... I... I was just making conversation.": 1, "Nothing. Well, not on purpose. But you never know. The strangest accidents can happen at any time.": 1, "Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you.": 1, "Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!": 1, "Now I've been told that the attacker claimed to be a Forsworn. It's nonsense. More likely he was just sick in the head. ": 1, "Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh.": 1, "Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me.": 1, "Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.": 1, "Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.": 1, "Nothing you can't handle.": 1, "Nothing yet.": 1, "Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for.": 1, "Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible.": 1, "Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you.": 1, "Nothing to do now but sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip home.": 1, "Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.": 1, "Nothing there. Strange.": 1, "Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.": 1, "Nothing specific, but I'm hearing rumblings of assassins living among us. I think they intend to target Councilor Morvayn, but I can't be certain.": 1, "Nothing seems to work!": 1, "Nothing, nothing at all! Arniel already overpaid for... whatever it is.": 1, "Nothing refreshes the soul like an honest day's labor in good, tilled earth.": 1, "Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while.": 1, "Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me.": 1, "Now he's in the Emperor's pocket like the rest of 'em, with no regard for honor an' tradition.": 1, "Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.": 1, "Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?": 1, "Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls.": 1, "Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.": 1, "Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me.": 1, "Now go. And give my best to the bride.": 1, "Now go.": 1, "Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.": 1, "Now go, leave me to my work.": 1, "Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!": 1, "Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy.": 1, "Now go and make us some coin, lass!": 1, "Now go and make us some coin, lad!": 1, "Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.": 1, "Now get outta here.": 1, "Now get out of my house!": 1, "Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.": 1, "Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.": 1, "Now everyone get back to work.": 1, "Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!": 1, "Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.": 1, "Now be silent, and hear what I have to say.": 1, "Now be gone.": 1, "Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think.": 1, "Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk.": 1, "Now all that's left are these Black Books. It's a shame I haven't located any more. So much more to be learned.": 1, "Now all that's left are these Black Books, waiting for another ambitious fool to be lured into Hermaeus Mora's clutches.": 1, "Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?": 1, "Now a voice whispers, saying \"Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise.\"": 1, "Now get out.": 1, "Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.": 1, "Nothing personal.": 1, "Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far.": 1, "Not while I'm still breathing, it's not.": 1, "Not when there's so much to see!": 1, "Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street.": 1, "Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way.": 1, "Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.": 1, "Not very sporting of you to do that.": 1, "Not until you get rid of whoever your other friend is.": 1, "Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.": 1, "Not until we have the bow. But... you're right.": 1, "Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.": 1, "Not until introductions are complete. Zin. Heyv. Test your Thu'um against mine, Dovahkiin!": 1, "Not until I've figured out what is going on.": 1, "Not too much farther now. Kynesgrove is just down the road to the southeast of here.": 1, "Not too long ago he tried to pawn some stuff off. Seemed kinda desperate for coin.": 1, "Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know.": 1, "Not too full on bread and wine, I hope?": 1, "Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.": 1, "Not too bad, I hope?": 1, "Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.": 1, "Not today, we can't.": 1, "Not today, too many things on my mind.": 1, "Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering.": 1, "Not to worry, Adril. I'll recover my losses in due time.": 1, "Not to mention the rebels completely control Windhelm and all of Eastmarch hold.": 1, "Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!": 1, "Not to mention our pay.": 1, "Not to mention my great fondness for dragons and petty political power struggles.": 1, "Not this time, Dragonborn. This one's mine.": 1, "Not this again...": 1, "Not the sneaking type, huh?": 1, "Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.": 1, "Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly.": 1, "Not without us, you aren't! I'm sure there's enough for everyone, after all.": 1, "Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could.": 1, "Nothing more to sell me?": 1, "Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?": 1, "Nothing like a goose chase around the whole damned province.": 1, "Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.": 1, "Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.": 1, "Nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison. ": 1, "Nothing for now. But watch your back. I'll be sending collectors to find you. They won't ask so nicely.": 1, "Nothing else?": 1, "Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.": 1, "Nothing but ruined books.": 1, "Nothing but foul deeds behind those walls.": 1, "Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort.": 1, "Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should see what we have available.": 1, "Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should come by our shop. Radiant Raiment.": 1, "Nothing after all.": 1, "Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.": 1, "Nothing I can't handle.": 1, "Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title.": 1, "Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that.": 1, "Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts.": 1, "Not yet. That may come later. First I need to identify the culprit.": 1, "Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find.": 1, "Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.": 1, "Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on.": 1, "Not your concern, anyway.": 1, "Not... exactly. Look, it's difficult to explain.": 1, "Not... finished yet...": 1, "Not... like... this...": 1, "Not... over... yet...": 1, "Not... yet...": 1, "Nothing I can't handle!": 1, "Not your first choice, I'd guess. ": 1, "Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel.": 1, "Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders.": 1, "Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.": 1, "Now this is a find! Plans for improving the Dwemer crossbow. This should add some extra punch to an already devastating weapon.": 1, "Now they say those green lands are ash covered too.": 1, "Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time.": 1, "Now there's a mystery.": 1, "Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.": 1, "Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.": 1, "Now then. I assume you know about...": 1, "Now the whole world will fall at our feet.": 1, "Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.": 1, "Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made.": 1, "Now the Elves dictate everything we do, and they don't want us acknowledging a \"mere human\" like Talos as the god he is.": 1, "Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.": 1, "Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.": 1, "Now that's what I call a punch. You got me.": 1, "Now this is going to be a good feast.": 1, "Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demented Daedra really need?": 1, "Now that's just ridiculous!": 1, "Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.": 1, "Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike.": 1, "Now that's a real man!": 1, "Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.": 1, "Now that you've delivered the message, I'm satisfied.": 1, "Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you.": 1, "Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life.": 1, "Now that we're back where we belong, I'm hoping we can get ourselves back to what Thirsk deserves.": 1, "Now that was a punch.": 1, "Now that was a proper adventure!": 1, "Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim.": 1, "Now that the first volume's complete, there's no much left to do but begin work on the second.": 1, "Now that the boilers are working, it should be simple to release the book from it's protective case.": 1, "Now that's something else, right there!": 1, "Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.": 1, "Now through me do you see.": 1, "Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy...": 1, "Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.": 1, "Now you I like. I've been getting sick of the pushovers that usually walk in here.": 1, "Now why would I want to work for House Telvanni?": 1, "Now why would I want to talk to you?": 1, "Now where is it Isran expects me to go?": 1, "Now where is it I'm supposed to be going?": 1, "Now where did I put...Oh, yeah.": 1, "Now where did I put that shipment of forks...": 1, "Now where did I leave that book on dragon language translation?": 1, "Now what?": 1, "Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?": 1, "Now what's going on?!": 1, "Now what was it I said to that prisoner? \"Stand up, there you go. You were dreaming...\" Yes, that was it.": 1, "Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?": 1, "Now through them do I speak.": 1, "Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor.": 1, "Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income.": 1, "Now we will see whose thu'um is the stronger!": 1, "Now we will see if he knows what he is talking about.": 1, "Now we never talk about it again. Got it?": 1, "Now we need to prepare a grand feast to welcome you to Namira's coven. ": 1, "Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.": 1, "Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else. ": 1, "Now we can talk.": 1, "Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love...": 1, "Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?": 1, "Now we can get back to work. Thank you.": 1, "Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started.": 1, "Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.": 1, "Now was it two parts giant lichen or three? Hm...": 1, "Now we're in for it.": 1, "Now that the Castle is yours, I was wondering.": 1, "Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim.": 1, "Now that our \"ghost\" has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim.": 1, "Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?": 1, "Now let's finish this.": 1, "Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.": 1, "Now let me concentrate.": 1, "Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.": 1, "Now keep going.": 1, "Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch.": 1, "Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.": 1, "Now it's time to use all three at once.": 1, "Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.": 1, "Now it's my turn.": 1, "Now it's a race to claim the remaining Scrolls and discover what part Auriel's Bow has to play in this prophecy.": 1, "Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.": 1, "Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.": 1, "Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?": 1, "Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit. Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our borders.": 1, "Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.": 1, "Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them.": 1, "Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out.": 1, "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to figure out how we're going to fill our recently emptied mine.": 1, "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mine that needs new workers to fill it.": 1, "Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep.": 1, "Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting.": 1, "Now if that don't answer your question, then no words will.": 1, "Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story.": 1, "Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child.": 1, "Now hold on! That wasn't my fault... I didn't know they were going to attack anybody. I don't even know how I got here.": 1, "Now hit the target to the left.": 1, "Now hit it again.": 1, "Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.": 1, "Now is not the time for talk...": 1, "Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?": 1, "Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.": 1, "Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism.": 1, "Now that my tower is healed, I can finish some of my more delicate experiments.": 1, "Now that my brother's dead, it's quite possible I'm the last of our kind.": 1, "Now that is a shame.": 1, "Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away for free.": 1, "Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities.": 1, "Now that I think on it, I did see your priest.": 1, "Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day.": 1, "Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general.": 1, "Now that I think about it... I should have expected that. Sorry.": 1, "Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it.": 1, "Now that I have his journal in hand, I can get some closure from the East Empire Company. Make them pay for lying to everyone.": 1, "Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek.": 1, "Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.": 1, "Now tell me, whom do you represent, and what do you want with me?": 1, "Now tell me, who is this stranger you have brought into our hall?": 1, "Now tell me where my brother is!": 1, "Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed - oh, and this was inspired - he forbade... death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!": 1, "Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.": 1, "Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.": 1, "Now my work will never see the light of day. My name will be forgotten.": 1, "Now now, brother. Arnoit is just being his usual gloomy self, he didn't mean it, did you Arnoit? You're just being silly again.": 1, "Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?": 1, "Now off with you! ": 1, "Now here's a man I'm glad to see.": 1, "Now our business together is done.": 1, "Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.": 1, "Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded.": 1, "Now please, no more questions.": 1, "Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath.": 1, "Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.": 1, "Now stand still... it's my first time casting this spell, and I don't need any additional distractions.": 1, "Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn.": 1, "Oh, yes. Weylin. Bastard could have at least gone crazy after we made our silver quota.": 1, "Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor.": 1, "Of course, when you reach my age, you'll find that the word \"young\" is a very relative term.": 1, "Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see you here.": 1, "Oh, hello hello!": 1, "Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him.": 1, "Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband.": 1, "Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love.": 1, "Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.": 1, "Oh, half the field should do.": 1, "Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard...": 1, "Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?": 1, "Oh, got more to say?": 1, "Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?": 1, "Oh, goodness no. There are those far more skilled than I.": 1, "Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here.": 1, "Oh, goodbye then.": 1, "Oh, hello! Just tidying up.": 1, "Oh, good. Well then... let's head over to the portal vessel and I'll do the rest.": 1, "Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to rely on Onmund.": 1, "Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to go ask J'zargo.": 1, "Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible.": 1, "Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks. ": 1, "Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so.": 1, "Oh, gods... what happened? What have I done?": 1, "Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!": 1, "Oh, forgive me.": 1, "Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you.": 1, "Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days...": 1, "Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?": 1, "Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?": 1, "Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess.": 1, "Oh, excuse me, milord. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.": 1, "Oh, good. She'll listen to you, I just know it.": 1, "Oh, excuse me, milady. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.": 1, "Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?": 1, "Oh, hey there! You here to join the Dawnguard, too?": 1, "Oh, look at the colors!": 1, "Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone.": 1, "Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it.": 1, "Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined.": 1, "Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers.": 1, "Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?": 1, "Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant.": 1, "Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?": 1, "Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again.": 1, "Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?": 1, "Oh, it's you! Sorry to hear about your imprisonment. I'm sure the guards didn't mean to throw you in jail": 1, "Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?": 1, "Oh, it's you again. Still looking for Miraak? I haven't learned anything useful since we last spoke, I'm afraid.": 1, "Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing.": 1, "Oh, hello. You looking for a handout or something?": 1, "Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun. ": 1, "Oh, it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least.": 1, "Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years.": 1, "Oh, it's Nazeem. He's been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore.": 1, "Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.": 1, "Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost.": 1, "Oh, it clearly is not associated with the same power that has overtaken the island.": 1, "Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening.": 1, "Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you...": 1, "Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt.": 1, "Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should.": 1, "Oh, how the Deceiver wags his clever tongue.": 1, "Oh, how kind. Thank Geldis for me, won't you?": 1, "Oh, how kind! Thank you.": 1, "Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?": 1, "Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures.": 1, "Oh, excuse me! I didn't realize there was anyone else here.": 1, "Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go.": 1, "Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?": 1, "Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir.": 1, "Oh, brother...": 1, "Oh, believe me... I'd be on the first ship off of this miserable island if I could.": 1, "Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil.": 1, "Oh, and you may use my staff enchanter if you want.": 1, "Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him.": 1, "Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?": 1, "Oh, and to be with you!": 1, "Oh, and they need to know how to brew tea. Ulves always waters it down.": 1, "Oh, and they hate it, too. All their big talk of pride and honor, and what have they got to show for it? Beggar's rags and stale bread.": 1, "Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent.": 1, "Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor.": 1, "Oh, and remind Elynea that she needs to fix my tower.": 1, "Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!": 1, "Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one.": 1, "Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here.": 1, "Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better. ": 1, "Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second.": 1, "Oh, and if the tower door suddenly gets icy cold, don't come in.": 1, "Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the part.": 1, "Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive.": 1, "Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword.": 1, "Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold.": 1, "Oh, and I suppose now he remembers that I proposed no less than three different scenarios that involved vampires overrunning the population.": 1, "Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time. ": 1, "Oh, all right then, Listener. Cicero will just carry on with what he was doing. Until you say otherwise.": 1, "Oh, absolutely. In fact, I've corresponded with Vittoria Vici herself more than once.": 1, "Oh, absolutely. But my mother's not a coward. ": 1, "Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks.": 1, "Oh, a customer. Sorry you had to hear that.": 1, "Oh, and one final thing...": 1, "Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot. ": 1, "Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably.": 1, "Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!": 1, "Oh, don't worry about me. I relish the challenge.": 1, "Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!": 1, "Oh, don't listen to her. We can do it, just give us a chance!": 1, "Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm....": 1, "Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later.": 1, "Oh, do you need a room?": 1, "Oh, do come in! I hope I have what you need.": 1, "Oh, didn't you know?": 1, "Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception.": 1, "Oh, definitely. Mother would have plenty of those materials in her laboratory, you just need to find them.": 1, "Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good.": 1, "Oh, dear. Would you look at that? How embarrassing.": 1, "Oh, could you get me an extra blanket. I think I might need it.": 1, "Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude.": 1, "Oh, come on. You know me, Captain Veleth. My hands are clean.": 1, "Oh, come on now. I'm going to need you to perk up if you're going to come with me as my second.": 1, "Oh, come now... spare me your notions of kinship.": 1, "Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone.": 1, "Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper.": 1, "Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business.": 1, "Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lass. Wealth is my business.": 1, "Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all.": 1, "Oh, but this isn't at all what Mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness.": 1, "Oh, look at you. What've you done? You've gone and gotten yourself turned into one of them.": 1, "Oh, but you are wrong.": 1, "Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences.": 1, "Oh, by all means. Just leave your refuse wherever you see fit.": 1, "Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now.": 1, "Oh, by the Divines, you too?": 1, "Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research.": 1, "Oh, come now. Don't go away mad.": 1, "Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things...": 1, "Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!": 1, "Oh, look! We have company!": 1, "Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories....": 1, "Oh, very well. Probably safest that way.": 1, "Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up.": 1, "Oh, very well. I'll send my brother. He'll straighten this out.": 1, "Oh, very well. I don't know how you expect me to keep this place in order when I can't make a profit.": 1, "Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds.": 1, "Oh, very well. Here. Tell him I hope he drops the thing on his foot.": 1, "Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can.": 1, "Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely...": 1, "Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood.": 1, "Oh, this pendant would look lovely on my sister.": 1, "Oh, this is simply getting infuriating!": 1, "Oh, this is not going to end well...": 1, "Oh, this is going to be great!": 1, "Oh, this is going to be fun. You've got to use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy while - get this - they use their Wabbajack to defeat you! ": 1, "Oh, wait a moment. Here, I want you to have these before you go.": 1, "Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck.": 1, "Oh, there's a better way.": 1, "Oh, the moths don't literally read the scrolls... but they maintain a connection to ancient magic that allows the Moth Priests to decipher them.": 1, "Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy.": 1, "Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path.": 1, "Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon.": 1, "Oh, that's the stuff all right. You're a good friend to Thirsk, and to me. I thank you.": 1, "Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman.": 1, "Oh, that's just adorable.": 1, "Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I think I'll join you.": 1, "Oh, that sounds lovely.": 1, "Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless.": 1, "Oh, thank you, but I should be fine now that you've shown me the way. But those bandits have to be stopped!": 1, "Oh, thank you! Divines bless your kind heart.": 1, "Oh, thank you!": 1, "Oh, they definitely were. ": 1, "Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands.": 1, "Oh, wait... did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies.": 1, "Oh, we have unfinished business you and I.": 1, "Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?": 1, "Oh, yes. J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage here.": 1, "Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion.": 1, "Oh, yes. Goodbye, goodbye.": 1, "Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always.": 1, "Oh, yes. A secret family recipe. The only good thing my father Octieve ever did. In fact, it's so good, no one else in Skyrim even tries to make any.": 1, "Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry...": 1, "Oh, yes, Miss Hulda.": 1, "Oh, yes! Quite! So many important people from all across Skyrim.": 1, "Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!": 1, "Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!": 1, "Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa.": 1, "Oh, wow. All right, well, what do you think my father's going to do once we bring the bow to him?": 1, "Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.": 1, "Oh, we do all right. Rumor is, you had a hand in the Blackblood Marauders' demise...": 1, "Oh, wonderful. Anything to keep the spirits up.": 1, "Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now.": 1, "Oh, why is that?": 1, "Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear.": 1, "Oh, what is it?": 1, "Oh, what delight. Another charming customer...": 1, "Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.": 1, "Oh, well... some... things, I suppose. Remedies, cures, a poison or two.": 1, "Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous...": 1, "Oh, well... I suppose that's a noble cause. I'll settle this bill at the end of the day. Thank you.": 1, "Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the...": 1, "Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can.": 1, "Oh, well done. Very subtle.": 1, "Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie.": 1, "Oh, wonderful. A war of succession. Good to know the world didn't get boring while I was gone.": 1, "Oh, thank you my chief!": 1, "Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!": 1, "Oh, thank goodness! I've been wandering alone for so long, I thought I'd never see another soul again.": 1, "Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.": 1, "Oh, no. No, that won't do at all.": 1, "Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times.": 1, "Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement.": 1, "Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement.": 1, "Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme.": 1, "Oh, no. I didn't find it. It found me. Here. I'll show you. See. Right there.": 1, "Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still.": 1, "Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for.": 1, "Oh, no.": 1, "Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one again. Next thing I know, I'm getting yelled at for saying something inappropriate.": 1, "Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold.": 1, "Oh, no no no... This is so wrong... ": 1, "Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth...": 1, "Oh, no... No, no, no...": 1, "Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!": 1, "Oh, no bother. We all have a right to be here.": 1, "Oh, never mind.": 1, "Oh, my. You'll want to talk to Enmon about that.": 1, "Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that.": 1, "Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold. ": 1, "Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead.": 1, "Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this.": 1, "Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!": 1, "Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed.": 1, "Oh, my aching head. Why do I do this to myself?": 1, "Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks.": 1, "Oh, most certainly! Let's find out what secrets the scroll can tell.": 1, "Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large.": 1, "Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?": 1, "Oh, no it hasn't. Let's be honest.": 1, "Oh, not so confident now, are we? ": 1, "Oh, nothing too dangerous.": 1, "Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious.": 1, "Oh, thank Arkay. Please, take this gold for your troubles.": 1, "Oh, such colors!": 1, "Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?": 1, "Oh, stop apologizing. It makes you look like an idiot. Learn to talk back a bit, girl! Why, when I was in the temple....": 1, "Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day.": 1, "Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them.": 1, "Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it...": 1, "Oh, so you're trying to play both sides, is that it? What do you really want?": 1, "Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine.": 1, "Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?": 1, "Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway.": 1, "Oh, right. Oh, well, things are going well enough. At least, as well as we can hope.": 1, "Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?": 1, "Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border.": 1, "Oh, really? You're just like my brother. Fine, but if you change your mind, I'll be right here.": 1, "Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?": 1, "Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind.": 1, "Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we?": 1, "Oh, now, do be careful...": 1, "Oh, now, that can't be good...": 1, "Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!": 1, "Oh, of course! Because Malacath would take pity on us if only a useless outsider would lend a hand.": 1, "Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's not.": 1, "Oh, look. A Nordic ruin.": 1, "Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain.": 1, "Oh, okay. I didn't think you'd help me. Nobody ever does.": 1, "Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way? ": 1, "Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably...": 1, "Oh, perfect. Just the right ripeness, too. Good work, friend.": 1, "Oh, probably a troll. ": 1, "Oh, really?": 1, "Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all.": 1, "Of course, they'd probably already be dead...": 1, "Oh, Varona. She didn't deserve this. This is a dark day for Tel Mithryn.": 1, "Oh, Sven. You do know how to turn a girl's head.": 1, "Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.": 1, "Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?": 1, "Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man. ": 1, "Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always.": 1, "Oh my. Been a lot of years since I've seen something like that...": 1, "Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years...": 1, "Oh my, that's... Well, that's not exactly what I had in mind.": 1, "Oh my, that's quite a difficult question.": 1, "Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!": 1, "Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!": 1, "Oh my, a guest!": 1, "Oh my, I very nearly got us both into a nasty predicament, didn't I?": 1, "Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry, Geldis! Please, tell me... what did he say?": 1, "Oh my goodness!": 1, "Oh my. That isn't right!": 1, "Oh look. My new master.": 1, "Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.": 1, "Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice.": 1, "Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done.": 1, "Oh ho! What's with the weapon? Looks like it's about to get rough in here. ": 1, "Oh here, just take it.": 1, "Oh have you? Well, let me just extract those memories and I'll see if you found anything useful.": 1, "Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed.": 1, "Oh good. Be sure to say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me, if you see him.": 1, "Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it...": 1, "Oh gods, my ears!": 1, "Oh fine, go on... leave me here. When you decide to return to your senses, you know where to find me.": 1, "Oh fine, fine. Here you go.": 1, "Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing.": 1, "Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth.": 1, "Oh it's you. The one from the market. ": 1, "Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?": 1, "Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?": 1, "Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!": 1, "Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.": 1, "Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them.": 1, "Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.": 1, "Oh that is exciting! I'm sure the court and the Jarl will love it. I'm writing it in now.": 1, "Oh thank you, milord. Thank you!": 1, "Oh thank you, milady. Thank you!": 1, "Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother.": 1, "Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...": 1, "Oh sure, keep pestering me then, by all means.": 1, "Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!": 1, "Oh splendid, another Nord.": 1, "Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her.": 1, "Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell.": 1, "Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath.": 1, "Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem.": 1, "Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.": 1, "Oh really? Hmm... this looks like someone from Staubin's little group. A brave scholar, but not very wise....": 1, "Oh please, milord. Please... forgive me!": 1, "Oh please, milady. Please... forgive me!": 1, "Oh of course. My mistake.": 1, "Oh no...": 1, "Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening.": 1, "Oh no, that's not it at all.": 1, "Oh no, not at all.": 1, "Oh no, most certainly not. I'm a historian. I'm here to learn about the history of Solstheim.": 1, "Oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not being blamed for saying something out of place. Again.": 1, "Oh no! What have I done?": 1, "Oh no! No, no, no. Narfi never got to say goodbye! Now Narfi's all alone.": 1, "Oh no! No!": 1, "Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.": 1, "Oh really? Well I think your new helper here needs a guide.": 1, "Oh dear. Why am I out here? I need to get back and make Master Neloth's tea.": 1, "Oh dear. What should I do?": 1, "Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.": 1, "Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lass.": 1, "Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad.": 1, "Of course... otherwise it wouldn't be much of a reward, now would it?": 1, "Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.": 1, "Of course. You're here for Auriel's Bow. Why else would you be here?": 1, "Of course. Why did I suppose differently. Fine, tell me what you know.": 1, "Of course. What is it?": 1, "Of course. What is it that you need me to do?": 1, "Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.": 1, "Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.": 1, "Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.": 1, "Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.": 1, "Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket.": 1, "Of course. It's available, if you want to buy it.": 1, "Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it.": 1, "Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.": 1, "Of course. I wouldn't be telling you where to find it if I desired it for myself.": 1, "Of course. I would have it no other way.": 1, "Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?": 1, "Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?": 1, "Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?": 1, "Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.": 1, "Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge.": 1, "Of course. But why not let him go in first?": 1, "Of course. But why not let her go in first?": 1, "Of course. But if you need me, just give the order.": 1, "Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level. ": 1, "Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.": 1, "Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise.": 1, "Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony.": 1, "Of course. I wouldn't be telling you where to find them if I desired them for myself.": 1, "Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.": 1, "Off we go.": 1, "Off with ya then. I've got work to do.": 1, "Oh dear. No, I'm afraid that's not going to work at all.": 1, "Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.": 1, "Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?": 1, "Oh dear, whatever is a girl to do with such fearful brutes about her?": 1, "Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that.": 1, "Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright.": 1, "Oh dear, I didn't mean to say it like that. That wasn't a joke, really.": 1, "Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore.": 1, "Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?": 1, "Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit.": 1, "Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!": 1, "Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?": 1, "Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?": 1, "Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it.": 1, "Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.": 1, "Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.": 1, "Oh Saadia...": 1, "Off you go. If you discover any side effects, come back and tell me straight away.": 1, "Offer to help and then change your mind because I mentioned the reavers? Hmph, some sellsword you are.": 1, "Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.": 1, "Officially, nothing.": 1, "Often I take on tasks that Garan or Feran find distasteful, or... beneath them.": 1, "Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.": 1, "Oh wow. This is gorgeous. ": 1, "Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home.": 1, "Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to.": 1, "Oh I get it. \"It's missing so Grelka must have it.\" I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me.": 1, "Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.": 1, "Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me.": 1, "Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth.": 1, "Oh Reyda! Redya! You live among the clouds now, dear Reyda!": 1, "Oh Babette, but you are so wicked.": 1, "Oh, Talos's breath, Reberrus. Skip ahead to the good part.": 1, "Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!": 1, "Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Been sitting by the fire all day.": 1, "Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!": 1, "Oh, I see. You've decided to cease pursuing your busy schedule and wish to talk now. How kind.": 1, "Oh, I see. Yes, yes of course I'll take a look. Just bring them by whenever it's convenient for you.": 1, "Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you about it.": 1, "Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?": 1, "Oh, I see. I just assumed he'd sent for both of us. How awkward for you.": 1, "Oh, I quite like living in the hall. Mother says it's an honor to live there and serve Morthal.": 1, "Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!": 1, "Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.": 1, "Oh, I know.": 1, "Oh, I know, Thonar. Only a mad woman would ever betray the Silver-Blood family.": 1, "Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place.": 1, "Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with.": 1, "Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen.": 1, "Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin.": 1, "Oh, I know enough. I know those trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!": 1, "Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique.": 1, "Oh, I get it. Is that why you're wearing an Amulet of Mara?": 1, "Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?": 1, "Oh, I doubt it. Deor has always been quick to worry.": 1, "Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd.": 1, "Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.": 1, "Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons.": 1, "Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be.": 1, "Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?": 1, "Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?": 1, "Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled.": 1, "Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...": 1, "Oh, I do not approve at all.": 1, "Oh, I didn't see you there.": 1, "Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin.": 1, "Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do...": 1, "Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today.": 1, "Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important.": 1, "Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes.": 1, "Oh, Sayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield.": 1, "Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!": 1, "Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.  ": 1, "Oh, Klimmek...": 1, "Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.": 1, "Oh, I... okay. Sorry.": 1, "Oh, I... I'm sorry. I just can't... you'll have to speak to my husband.": 1, "Oh, I've read a few things. Heard a few more things. Arkay's told me a bit as well.": 1, "Oh, I've heard this one before. Watch out Divines, poor Kodrir curses you all for giving him life!": 1, "Oh, I'm sure it will be. Give them here, and I'll get to work soon!": 1, "Oh, I'm sure I have something you'll find useful.": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to bring up a bad memory.": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?": 1, "Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat.": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me.": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry about that.": 1, "Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims.": 1, "Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind.": 1, "Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend. ": 1, "Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him.": 1, "Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure.": 1, "Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her.": 1, "Oh, I'm a good keeper of secrets. Have to be, in this hall.": 1, "Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money.": 1, "Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!": 1, "Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines.": 1, "Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow...": 1, "Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.": 1, "Oh, I'm sorry to keep you. Head right in. ": 1, "Oh, I am so happy for you! My, what a burden to have carried. But you've done it! You've conquered your own inner demons! Bravo! ": 1, "Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down.": 1, "Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan.": 1, "Oh! Bolli... yes, hello.": 1, "Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?": 1, "Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you.": 1, "Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.": 1, "Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...": 1, "Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.": 1, "Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!": 1, "Oh yes. You rather rudely walked away. As I was saying then, have you heard of the Briarhearts?": 1, "Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them. I have one here that I've been using to locate more.": 1, "Oh yes. They were an important part of the process here.": 1, "Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. ": 1, "Oh yes. I know everyone who sleeps in the Warrens. Kind of the one who passes the keys around.": 1, "Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor. ": 1, "Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time?": 1, "Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it.": 1, "Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.": 1, "Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley.": 1, "Oh yes, of course. It's available to you for purchase.": 1, "Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done.": 1, "Oh yes, mistress. You're the \"boss.\" For now.": 1, "Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.": 1, "Oh yes, many times. But mighty Talos was my keeper, my shield against the heresy of the south!": 1, "Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!": 1, "Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods \"unsettling.\" The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently. ": 1, "Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!": 1, "Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the \"White-Gold Concordat.\"": 1, "Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes.": 1, "Oh yeah? Well, I've seen mudcrabs that're smarter than you!": 1, "Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.": 1, "Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Had a room here I think. Ask the innkeeper.": 1, "Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need.": 1, "Oh! I didn't expect that!": 1, "Oh! I don't feel any different. What did you do?": 1, "Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.": 1, "Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...": 1, "Oh, Glover Mallory gets me a few things once in a while. He usually has the most amazing deals that I can't pass up.": 1, "Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes.": 1, "Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon.": 1, "Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that?": 1, "Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.": 1, "Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!": 1, "Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my...": 1, "Oh, Beem-Ja. I never meant for this. What have I done?": 1, "Oh, Astrid...": 1, "Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!": 1, "Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all.": 1, "Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!": 1, "Oh! You startled me. I wasn't expecting company out here.": 1, "Oh! You behave, now!": 1, "Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem.": 1, "Oh! What did you just do?": 1, "Oh! Look over there!": 1, "Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?": 1, "Oh! No, I didn't mean it that way. Elgrim can barely put his on his own shoes let alone have the energy to pursue a young girl.": 1, "Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.": 1, "Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!": 1, "Oh! Oh... no... No!": 1, "Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?": 1, "Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.": 1, "Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain...": 1, "Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me.": 1, "Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you.": 1, "Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.": 1, "Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends \"hello\" right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!": 1, "Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together.": 1, "Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done.": 1, "Relax, hero... he's fine. At least he was. The chief liked him so much, she took him back home. Here's a letter for you.": 1, "Relax, new blood. ": 1, "Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.": 1, "Still, if he sent you to find me, it may actually be pretty bad.": 1, "Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement.": 1, "Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here.": 1, "Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you.": 1, "Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks.": 1, "Still, I fear there is some connection.": 1, "Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment.": 1, "Still you persist? Very well.": 1, "Still you persist? Very well, you may enter.": 1, "Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done.": 1, "Still suspicious of me. Well, don't say I never offered.": 1, "Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone.": 1, "Still over half the pages are missing. Keep trying.": 1, "Still no word from your family?": 1, "Still, if it means their safe-keeping, I suppose it is worth it.": 1, "Still interested in heading over there?": 1, "Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree? ": 1, "Still can't figure out why I was working on that damned pillar.": 1, "Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way.": 1, "Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there.": 1, "Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?": 1, "Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.": 1, "Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough.": 1, "Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.": 1, "Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about.": 1, "Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them.": 1, "Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time.": 1, "Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.": 1, "Steward Falk, I have a task for you.": 1, "Stew again, papa? I want steak.": 1, "Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?": 1, "Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time.": 1, "Still, it's beautiful.": 1, "Still, its liquid is powerful, full of magic. Others have noticed, though they have never fully realized its potential.": 1, "Stop! We know you're holding a Daedric artifact. Hand it over.": 1, "Stop! Enough! Stand down!": 1, "Stop your whining.": 1, "Stop yammering and keep your eyes peeled. They could be here at any moment. If I were them I'd come straight here, sword swingin'!": 1, "Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot? ": 1, "Stop that! How can I do my job if I'm invisible?": 1, "Stop struggling. I'll give you a swift and beautiful death.": 1, "Stop right there... where have I seen you before?": 1, "Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.": 1, "Stop right there. ": 1, "Stop right there! Were I can see you.": 1, "Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done.": 1, "Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children.": 1, "Stop it! This is a one-on-one duel!": 1, "Still, it's my duty to help protect Skyrim as much as any Nord's, don't you think?": 1, "Stop it! I don't like magic.": 1, "Stop by my stall in the market sometime.": 1, "Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you.": 1, "Stop by again!": 1, "Stop bothering me Aicanter!": 1, "Stop back anytime.": 1, "Stop apologizing for everything. ": 1, "Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land.": 1, "Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.": 1, "Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here.": 1, "Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.": 1, "Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you.": 1, "Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me.": 1, "Still, you are a good friend to J'zargo now, for taking this risk. J'zargo thanks you.": 1, "Still, those of us here have as much of an obligation to protect Skyrim as any other, wouldn't you agree?": 1, "Stop hiding, coward. I'll make it quick, I promise.": 1, "Step lightly. Who knows if those things can hear us or not.": 1, "Step into the light, and your test begins.": 1, "Step from the shadows, defiler.": 1, "Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.": 1, "Stay out of our way, or I promise you'll regret it.": 1, "Stay on your guard.": 1, "Stay here. I'll go check it out if you open the door back up.": 1, "Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.": 1, "Stay close to the wall!": 1, "Stay clear of the Forsworn. Bloodthirsty savages.": 1, "Stay clear of that College, if you know what's good for you.": 1, "Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!": 1, "Stay away! Last time you hurt me.": 1, "Stay away!": 1, "Stay away from that.": 1, "Stay away from Camilla.": 1, "Stay alert. They may not have gone far.": 1, "Stay out of trouble in my city.": 1, "Stay alert.": 1, "Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?": 1, "Stars? You wouldn't be referring to that incident a few years ago? I still say that exile was far too harsh.": 1, "Stand... still!": 1, "Stand together and we shall defeat him!": 1, "Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!": 1, "Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.": 1, "Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.": 1, "Stand back and behold my handiwork.": 1, "Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg.": 1, "Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.": 1, "Stand aside.": 1, "Stand aside, outlander.": 1, "Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.": 1, "Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener.": 1, "Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit.": 1, "Stay out of trouble, now.": 1, "Stay out of trouble.": 1, "Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble.": 1, "Step aside Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender. ": 1, "Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!": 1, "Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star.": 1, "Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.": 1, "Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it.": 1, "Stendarr's Mercy be upon you, for the Vigil has none to spare.": 1, "Stendarr's Light purify you of your ills.": 1, "Stendarr watch over you.": 1, "Stendarr grant that you do not have to face the same test and be found wanting.": 1, "Stendarr be with you.": 1, "Steer clear of this cabin, or you'll regret it.": 1, "Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.": 1, "Steel, dwarven, ebony... if it's broken, I can mend it.": 1, "Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second.": 1, "Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.": 1, "Stealing a man's mind... it just isn't right. Thanks for saving me from that madman.": 1, "Steal anything from my shop, and you'll regret it.": 1, "Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war.": 1, "Stay under cover!": 1, "Stay under cover. This is what we came for. We need to see what happens.": 1, "Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!": 1, "Stay vigilant, friend.": 1, "Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.": 1, "Stop, in the name of the Jarl!": 1, "Stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.": 1, "Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.": 1, "Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.": 1, "Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!": 1, "Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.": 1, "Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.": 1, "Steady. Let's see what it does.": 1, "Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.": 1, "Stab you, stab you, stab you!": 1, "Stop, outlander! You must pay bloodprice for your crimes.": 1, "Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.": 1, "Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything...": 1, "Sure, that's what they all say.": 1, "Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead.": 1, "Sure, take all my things. Please.": 1, "Sure, sure. It's just, you know, not every day I meet someone who's laid eyes on a dragon.": 1, "Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me.": 1, "Sure, pick on the old guy!": 1, "Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway.": 1, "Sure, leave. Everyone else does.": 1, "Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't.": 1, "Sure, ignore the ravings of a \"crazy old man.\" I get it.": 1, "Sure, how about I get Dirge to knock you over your head and dump you into the cistern?": 1, "Sure, got plenty. What am I gonna' do with it?": 1, "Sure, got nothing better to do.": 1, "Sure, whatever you say. Bye.": 1, "Sure, fine. Thanks for nothing. You already got what you needed from me.": 1, "Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!": 1, "Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one.": 1, "Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it.": 1, "Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one.": 1, "Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock.": 1, "Sure, I understand. It's not easy to go from being executed by the Legion one day to joining up the next.": 1, "Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold.": 1, "Sure, I bet you are. Everyone's always sorry.": 1, "Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is.": 1, "Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want.": 1, "Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.": 1, "Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.": 1, "Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage.": 1, "Sure I did. And I'd do it again.": 1, "Sure, but then where would you go?": 1, "Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!": 1, "Sure, whatever.": 1, "Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?": 1, "Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.": 1, "Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.": 1, "Svari, yes. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle.": 1, "Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?": 1, "Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?": 1, "Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?": 1, "Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?": 1, "Surrender or die, outlander!": 1, "Surrender and give us the bow!": 1, "Surprisingly, they agreed to protect us but demanded a terrible price... the blinding of our race.": 1, "Surprised? So was I, when a member of your \"Family\" came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange.": 1, "Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.": 1, "Surprised you weren't at the last meeting with our Lord, Vingalmo. Too busy plotting to overthrow him to show up?": 1, "Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.": 1, "Sure, why not.": 1, "Surely you've heard of \"The Rise and Fall of Saint Jiub the Eradicator: Hero of Morrowind and Savior of the Dunmer.\"": 1, "Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?": 1, "Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...": 1, "Surely you have something better to do...": 1, "Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?": 1, "Sure... do you have any arrows, though? They would have to be of elven quality, I'd guess.": 1, "Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?": 1, "Sure. Whatever.": 1, "Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.": 1, "Sure. Just let me get my things.": 1, "Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?": 1, "Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?": 1, "Sure. Here you go. Can't understand a word of it, maybe it will do you some good.": 1, "Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!": 1, "Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine.": 1, "Surely you're joking?": 1, "Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter.": 1, "Supposedly, they had to build a special forge, the Aetherium Forge, to even work with it.": 1, "Supposedly, the bow draws its energy from the sun itself, which it why it shows up in that prophecy.": 1, "Studies stars? I remember the last time the word \"stars\" was flown through the Hall of the Elements. Bad things had happened.": 1, "Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh....": 1, "Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company.": 1, "Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it.": 1, "Strong steel guard you, friend.": 1, "Strong gauntlets for strong hands.": 1, "Strong always fight strong. Old chief strong, me stronger.": 1, "Strong always fight strong!": 1, "Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving you openings!": 1, "Strike hard and fast!": 1, "Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient.": 1, "Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world.": 1, "Strength and courage be always with you.": 1, "Strangers are nothing but trouble.": 1, "Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back.": 1, "Strangers are always trouble.": 1, "Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.": 1, "Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?": 1, "Storn! What is he doing?": 1, "Storn will protect us. We will be safe.": 1, "Storn was like a father to me. To all of us. I do not know what we will do without him.": 1, "Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.": 1, "Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.": 1, "Stormcloaks were already camped out around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though.": 1, "Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.": 1, "Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots.": 1, "Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order.": 1, "Stormcloak lover.": 1, "Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation.": 1, "Stormblade.": 1, "Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?": 1, "Su'um ahrk morah.": 1, "Submit and pay bloodprice, criminal.": 1, "Succeed at this, and you'll be rewarded. Whiterun will be in your debt.": 1, "Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession.": 1, "Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging soon.": 1, "Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago.": 1, "Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.": 1, "Summoning you here was part of my plan. I was hoping you'd be interested in investigating for me.": 1, "Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.": 1, "Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?": 1, "Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!": 1, "Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned.": 1, "Suits me just fine.": 1, "Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around.": 1, "Suit yourself. I'm not going anywhere.": 1, "Suit yourself. I'm always here.": 1, "Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind.": 1, "Suit yourself. I hate to turn away any friend of Hadvar, but in times like these... you understand if I can't just take your word for it.": 1, "Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!": 1, "Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them. ": 1, "Such a fine day, smell the air! Isn't it wonderful?": 1, "Such a kind nibble you are.": 1, "Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.": 1, "Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.": 1, "Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers.": 1, "Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way.": 1, "Stop, outlander. You must pay for your crimes in blood or gold.": 1, "Such is our way! Such is the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!": 1, "Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.": 1, "Suddenly I feel much better.": 1, "Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims.": 1, "Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.": 1, "Suit yourself, but you better decide what you want to do about this arrest. No one walks away for free.": 1, "Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt.": 1, "Such was my... honor. As Keeper.": 1, "Sven, we need to talk...": 1, "Stab and run! The tribe-kin way.": 1, "Sssssh!

A lot's happened.": 1, "Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances.": 1, "Sorry friend, but I'm on the road home. Find me there and perhaps we can talk.": 1, "Sorry about the thugs and Mogrul and everything.": 1, "Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all.": 1, "Sorry about the mess.

I'll get it to you somehow.": 1, "Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world.": 1, "Sorry, Miss Temba.": 1, "Sorry, I... Never mind.": 1, "Sorry, I've just had a lot of hork-faced cowards coming by to mock my efforts.": 1, "Sorry, I'm not that easy to get rid of.

What in the name of Vivec are you talking about?": 1, "Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled.": 1, "Sounds good.

How did you keep them so fresh?": 1, "Thanks for talking to me.": 1, "Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.": 1, "Thanks for taking that thing down. We're supposed to be warriors, not crafters.": 1, "Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.": 1, "Thanks for looking after Hrefna.": 1, "Thanks for having my back, friend.": 1, "Thanks for getting me out of that.

You're doing great.": 1, "That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will.": 1, "That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.": 1, "That Telvanni wizard is unhinged. I heard he tries to drink the ash.": 1, "That Moth Priest, Dexion. He said we needed two other Elder Scrolls. I think I know where we can start looking.": 1, "That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out.": 1, "That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me.": 1, "That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago.": 1, "That I am. You know how to use one?": 1, "That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.": 1, "That I am. So I'm guessing you want to just use my blood, then? ": 1, "That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.": 1, "That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.": 1, "That Empire is dead. And so are you. ": 1, "Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you.": 1, "That Drovas man?": 1, "That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding.

I wasn't sure I'd make it off this farm alive.": 1, "Thanks. You take care of yourself, now.": 1, "Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy something for this headache.": 1, "Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh.": 1, "Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.": 1, "Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.": 1, "Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.": 1, "Thanks. I only wish Lucan was here to see this again.": 1, "Thanks. I only wish Camilla was here to see it.": 1, "Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Lucan.": 1, "That Cicero feller?": 1, "Thanks again for searching. I don't know what I'd do without my pages.": 1, "Thanks again for saving my life. I think I'm done with venturing outside of Markarth, though.": 1, "Thanks again for saving my life.": 1, "Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.": 1, "Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant. ": 1, "Thank you.

I will not forget this.": 1, "Thank you. I was afraid I'd have to figure out some way to do this on my own.": 1, "Thank you. I knew you'd understand.": 1, "Thank you. I don't know what's going on, but I think I owe you my life.": 1, "Thank you. I didn't mean to be so defensive.": 1, "Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.": 1, "Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons but Inge... Dean Six Fingers... says I'm quite good with the flute.": 1, "Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.": 1, "Thank you. Here. You honored my mother's task and should be rewarded.": 1, "Thank you. Here, this is for you.": 1, "Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory.": 1, "Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you.": 1, "Thank you. Here, I was going to bring this to my sister, but I think you should have it.": 1, "Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there.": 1, "Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help.": 1, "Thank you. Do hurry please.": 1, "Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.": 1, "Thank you, you have no idea how much it hurts losing such a precious heirloom!": 1, "Thank you, wanderer. That would be most kind.": 1, "Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky.": 1, "Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause.": 1, "Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in.": 1, "Thank you. Honor dictates something in return. I hope you find this pleasing.": 1, "Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons. Dean Six Fingers used to say I was quite good with the flute.": 1, "Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.": 1, "Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this.": 1, "Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.": 1, "Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.": 1, "Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.": 1, "Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.": 1, "Thanks again for all your help.": 1, "Thanks a lot. Here - a little something for your trouble.": 1, "Thanks a lot! Here. Take this. For all your hard work.": 1, "Thanks Nana. I feel better now.": 1, "Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!": 1, "Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas.": 1, "Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.": 1, "Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this.": 1, "Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you.": 1, "Thank you. Whatever your other reasons for acting, you have done the Skaal a great service. We will not forget what you've done.": 1, "Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too.": 1, "Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day.": 1, "Thank you. The Eight keep you.": 1, "Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.": 1, "Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.": 1, "Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.": 1, "Thank you. Miraak took great pains to make it difficult to reach him, it seems.": 1, "Thank you. Please hurry!": 1, "Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private.": 1, "That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt.": 1, "Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered.": 1, "Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this.": 1, "Thank you. Somehow I knew you'd understand.": 1, "Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial.": 1, "Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.": 1, "Thank you. Thank you, Dragonborn. You've done a great service for us all.": 1, "Thank you. That bastard got exactly what he deserved.": 1, "Thank you. Please, take this for your efforts.": 1, "Thank you, stranger. Thanks for everything.": 1, "That answer your damn questions? Now get out.": 1, "That ash eating wizard is always on me about his tower. It's not my damn fault the thing withered overnight.": 1, "That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed.": 1, "That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.": 1, "That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn.": 1, "That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once.": 1, "That may be the case.": 1, "That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him.": 1, "That man is going to kill himself one day, and take the rest of us with him.": 1, "That make you feel any better?": 1, "That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!": 1, "That looks like quite a drop! Is there something moving down there?": 1, "That looks like it's the last of them.": 1, "That looks dangerous...": 1, "That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.": 1, "That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.": 1, "That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.": 1, "That journal means a lot to me, if you find it.": 1, "That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.": 1, "That isn't my problem. I was clear when I loaned Garyn the money that I wanted it back by the first harvest.": 1, "That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.": 1, "That is... I don't think we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.": 1, "That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim.": 1, "That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs.": 1, "That is what the stories say. You are Dragonborn as well, then. Perhaps you are connected.": 1, "That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes.": 1, "That is true, yes.": 1, "That is to say, it's been suggested that resources used for my study of Restoration could be put to better use. Any other use, in fact.": 1, "That is the way of things. We must be prepared.": 1, "That is the very purpose that first brought me to Skyrim.": 1, "That is the truth.": 1, "That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.": 1, "That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.": 1, "That is the true meaning of \"Yol.\" Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice.": 1, "That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.": 1, "That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.": 1, "That spell looks like it'll hurt.": 1, "That spell looks dangerous...": 1, "That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me.": 1, "That sounds lovely. You're very sweet.": 1, "That sounds good. I'm not sure the court will believe that Olaf had wizard powers but we shall see.": 1, "That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!": 1, "That something... was probably me. ": 1, "That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.": 1, "That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.": 1, "That should do it.": 1, "That should be all right. How much space were you planning?": 1, "That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.": 1, "That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but at least it's finally done.": 1, "That seems to be all of them.": 1, "That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing.": 1, "That seems inadvisable... oh well.": 1, "That said, some of the Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating out of hidden military camps in the wilderness.": 1, "That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them.": 1, "That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around.": 1, "That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.": 1, "That put a spring in my step.": 1, "That part, I don't know. Once we have it, hopefully it'll be obvious.": 1, "That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli.": 1, "That noise... I'm not alone here.": 1, "That must have been quite a surprise.": 1, "That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time.": 1, "That must be it. Fort Dawnguard... Wow. Bigger than I expected.": 1, "That museum is a mistake.": 1, "That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got.": 1, "That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?": 1, "That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...": 1, "That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself.": 1, "That is sweet of you, Deor, but you should find a better hiding place next time.": 1, "That is so.": 1, "That explains what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was...": 1, "That ends it.": 1, "That dunmer is crazy!": 1, "That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.": 1, "That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.": 1, "That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends.": 1, "That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.": 1, "That doesn't make much sense. Where is this woman? Who is she?": 1, "That doesn't exactly make me want to open up. ": 1, "That doesn't change anything.": 1, "That doesn't bother you? Hmm.": 1, "That doesn't begin to describe it.": 1, "That depends on who you ask.": 1, "That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.": 1, "That fetcher Geldis won't even allow me inside. Said I was bad for business.": 1, "That damn dremora and his minions. They didn't even give me a chance to explain who I was.": 1, "That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.": 1, "That could have turned out better.": 1, "That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!": 1, "That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement.": 1, "That circle in the center of the room is definitely some type of portal.": 1, "That chamber has been withered for too long.": 1, "That can't be a coincidence.": 1, "That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear. ": 1, "That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.": 1, "That blasted wizard couldn't be bothered to give her some protection for those trips. This is all his fault.": 1, "That belongs to me.": 1, "That bastard got exactly what he deserved.": 1, "That bark's pretty fragrant, no wonder the moths are attracted to it.": 1, "That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me.": 1, "That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...": 1, "That fetcher told me to fix his house.": 1, "That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.": 1, "That fetcher... making us build his shrines. If I could only get my hands on him...": 1, "That is rich. What did she do?": 1, "That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.": 1, "That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them.": 1, "That is our name for him - the Demon of Knowledge. He has always been our enemy.": 1, "That is my hope as well. I am trusting that you will make this sacrifice worthwhile.": 1, "That is enough.": 1, "That is correct. You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven.": 1, "That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?": 1, "That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.": 1, "That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift.": 1, "That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep.": 1, "That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it.": 1, "That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these lessons, you need only ask.": 1, "That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind.": 1, "That is a personal matter, and one I will not discuss.": 1, "That is a lot of blood.": 1, "That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are.": 1, "That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is.": 1, "That foolish old man thinks he's thirty years younger than he is. He's going to get himself killed traipsing around the mine.": 1, "That gave me the shivers!": 1, "That gem looks suspicious to me.": 1, "That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.": 1, "That godless Emperor can shove his damn treaty into the steaming nether-reaches of my you-know-where.": 1, "That armor on Gunjar isn't doing him any good. Go ahead. Take it.": 1, "That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!": 1, "That he did. Right out from under my nose. Can you believe it?": 1, "That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.": 1, "That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.": 1, "That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.": 1, "That is \"Feim.\" Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength.": 1, "That is \"Fus.\" Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.": 1, "That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again.": 1, "Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe? ": 1, "Thank you, outsider.": 1, "Thank you, my friend. You have set us free.": 1, "Taron Dreth, the world's foremost expert in Dwemer metallurgy. Not that you would know anything about that.": 1, "Taproot? That's all? Add it to the Raven Rock list.": 1, "Talvas should finish his apprenticeship in a couple of decades. Come see me then. I think I could teach you a trick or two.": 1, "Talvas says Master Neloth is asking for me.": 1, "Talvas is Master Neloth's apprentice. If you are interested in spells, he might be willing to sell you some.": 1, "Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire. ": 1, "Talos watch over you.": 1, "Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference.": 1, "Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!": 1, "Talos protect you, friend.": 1, "Talos preserve us.": 1, "Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire.": 1, "Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.": 1, "Talos guide you, lass.": 1, "Taron Dreth. The world's foremost expert on Dwemer forging techniques. Now answer my question!": 1, "Talos guide you, lad.": 1, "Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.": 1, "Talos bless you, my child.": 1, "Talos be with you...": 1, "Talos be with you!": 1, "Talk to my parents if you need something.": 1, "Talk to Serana, and decide which you want to be.": 1, "Talk to Ralis about this mess.": 1, "Talk to Isran. He'll decide if he wants you for the Dawnguard.": 1, "Talk to Gunmar if you need materials.": 1, "Talk to Geimund if you want a horse, or Katla if you're looking for work. I can't help you.": 1, "Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her. ": 1, "Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?": 1, "Talen! Another round!": 1, "Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?": 1, "Talos guard you.": 1, "Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.": 1, "Tarry not too long - the land of the dead is not meant for mortals to linger.": 1, "Tasty, sugary treats!": 1, "Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.": 1, "Tell me more about what's going on.": 1, "Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.": 1, "Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale.": 1, "Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!": 1, "Tell me about the Great War. I hear you were in the battle of...": 1, "Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.": 1, "Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on.": 1, "Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart.": 1, "Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand.": 1, "Tell her she'll welcome back anytime.": 1, "Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.": 1, "Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.": 1, "Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.": 1, "Tart bones? That doesn't even make sense. I'll just ignore that part.": 1, "Tell Morwen I'll be happy to grant her request. I am sure it will bring joy to her mother and father as they walk in Aetherius.": 1, "Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it.": 1, "Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.": 1, "Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been waiting for, all these years: \"Darkness rises when silence dies.\"": 1, "Tell Bralsa she's welcome here anytime.": 1, "Teldryn Sero, blade for hire. If you have the coin, I'm at your service.": 1, "Tel Mithryn is the safest place in Solstheim. Only a fool would challenge Master Neloth.": 1, "Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.": 1, "Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?": 1, "Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.": 1, "Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always.": 1, "Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation.": 1, "Teamwork, right there.": 1, "Teach them to stop paying me.": 1, "Taxes. I love taxes.": 1, "Tell Erik that I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor. And please don't hurt me!": 1, "Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?": 1, "Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.": 1, "Takes money to make money, all that rot. There's a lot of it at the other end, but I can't get there without a little kick to start it off.": 1, "Take it easy, father. You're making a scene.": 1, "Take it easy, Vekel. How long we known each other? Yeah. I checked it. All the stuff is in the safe.": 1, "Take home Windhelm's finest and freshest produce today!": 1, "Take him down! It's our best chance!": 1, "Take great care, and know that the Order is watching.": 1, "Take good care of it for me.": 1, "Take down that one with your bare hands too?": 1, "Take care, stranger. Be careful out there.": 1, "Take care, husband.": 1, "Take care, friend.": 1, "Take care, dearie.": 1, "Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine.": 1, "Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight.": 1, "Take care of yourself, beef roast.": 1, "Take it slow and careful, and I think we can sneak by her.": 1, "Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood...": 1, "Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you.": 1, "Take care not to set anything on fire.": 1, "Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary.": 1, "Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began. ": 1, "Take a moment to breathe, soldier.": 1, "Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!": 1, "Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?": 1, "Take a left up here. This is one of those weird double-barred security measures that my father put in when he got more paranoid.": 1, "Take a deep breath and let it out as you fire.": 1, "Tag! You're it!": 1, "Tacitus? What is this?": 1, "Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it.": 1, "Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe.": 1, "Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.": 1, "Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye.": 1, "Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us.": 1, "Take it.": 1, "Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival.": 1, "Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?": 1, "Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?": 1, "Take your time. I shall follow when you are ready.": 1, "Take your time then. It isn't as though the Greybeards are going to complain.": 1, "Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.": 1, "Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead.": 1, "Take your books and go, before I change my mind.": 1, "Take your best shot, fetcher!": 1, "Take your best shot!": 1, "Take what you need, my friend. Within reason, of course.": 1, "Take us!": 1, "Take us to Movarth's Lair!": 1, "Take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.": 1, "Take this with our gratitude.": 1, "Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.": 1, "Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it.": 1, "Take the scroll, then be on your way.": 1, "Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.": 1, "Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.": 1, "Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.": 1, "Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest.": 1, "Take pity, lady, and spare me a few septims.": 1, "Take pity, sir, and spare me a few septims.": 1, "Tell me what you need, and I'll get my people get on it.": 1, "Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier.": 1, "Take that swill and pour it down a well.": 1, "Take that!": 1, "Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here.": 1, "Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.": 1, "Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.": 1, "Take the money, just let us go...": 1, "Take that last taproot and plant it into the wall of the withered house.": 1, "Thank you, oh thank you.": 1, "Tell me what you're looking for and maybe we can make a deal... if you have the husks.": 1, "Tell me you looked through the trash before you did that.": 1, "Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.": 1, "Thank you yet again. I will make sure our applicant, who was instrumental in... recovering the poem will be well rewarded.": 1, "Thank you very much for your business.": 1, "Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.": 1, "Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.": 1, "Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.": 1, "Thank you so much, this scroll means a lot to my family. Take this for your trouble.": 1, "Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock.": 1, "Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!": 1, "Thank you sir.": 1, "Thank you for your time.": 1, "Thank you for your patronage.": 1, "Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling hungry.": 1, "Thank you for your help. You may go now.": 1, "Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.": 1, "Thank you for your help. We will meet again soon.": 1, "Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?": 1, "Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members.": 1, "Thank you for your custom.": 1, "Thank you for your assistance, it's raised my men's spirits quite a bit.": 1, "Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.": 1, "Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.": 1, "Thank you for the gold, traveler.": 1, "Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use.": 1, "Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer. ": 1, "Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name.": 1, "Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him.": 1, "Thank you for sticking by me.": 1, "Thank you for setting my mind to rest. Now I can hope the All-Maker will show mercy to him in the beyond.": 1, "Thank you for rescuing us from that awful stone pillar.": 1, "Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it.": 1, "Thank you for rescuing me.": 1, "Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble.": 1, "Thank you! It's not much, but this will help a great deal with some things I've been researching.": 1, "Thank you, my friend.": 1, "Thank you, my chief.": 1, "Thank you, miss, I appreciate that.": 1, "Thank you, milord.": 1, "Thank you, milady.": 1, "Thank you, master. It's all because of your brilliant teaching.": 1, "Thank you, marsh-friend.": 1, "Thank you, land-strider.": 1, "Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here.": 1, "Thank you, good patrons of the Bannered Mare! Thank you!": 1, "Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you.": 1, "Thank you, friend.": 1, "Thank you, dear. It must be nice to get out of the hall every now and then.": 1, "Thank you, dear.": 1, "Thank you! I was hoping you would.": 1, "Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son.": 1, "Thank you, Thonar. That's generous of you to say.": 1, "Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us.": 1, "Thank you, Madena. I appreciate your assistance.": 1, "Thank you, Lisbet. It's been such a joy to dine with you all these years.": 1, "Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed.": 1, "Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments.": 1, "Thank you, Laila.": 1, "Thank you, I thought so, too.": 1, "Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days.": 1, "Thank you! You're too kind.": 1, "Thank you! You'll find the ruins right here.": 1, "Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do.": 1, "Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!": 1, "Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!": 1, "Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild.": 1, "Thank you for rescuing me from High Point tower.": 1, "Thank you for releasing us from her spell.": 1, "Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around.": 1, "Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.": 1, "Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it.": 1, "Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It's a win-win.": 1, "Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately.": 1, "Tell you what. Since you went through all the trouble of finding it for me and all, you keep it.": 1, "Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.": 1, "Tell you what. If you use them to make your kwama egg stew, you can have them for free.": 1, "Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them.": 1, "Tell you what. I'll make sure we have a permanent foot patrol over there. It's the least I can do for you.": 1, "Tell you what. I'll give you a share right now if you forget the whole thing.": 1, "Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight.": 1, "Tell you what. Go along with his plans for now. I'll keep an eye on you both and, when the time is right, I'll settle accounts with Louis.": 1, "Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine.": 1, "Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.": 1, "Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?": 1, "Tell you what, you bring me books like this, and I'll pay a thousand gold each. I'll even throw in a translated edition I have for free. Interested?": 1, "Tell these Horkers to set me free.": 1, "Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.": 1, "Tell the blacksmith whatever lie you will. We have no further need of him.": 1, "Tell my father if he wants to speak to me, he should do it in person.": 1, "Tell my family I fought bravely.": 1, "Tell me... was it the only way? Did he need to die?": 1, "Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?": 1, "Tell me, what is your name?": 1, "Tell me, though... my father's death... was it necessary? Was there no other way to destroy Miraak?": 1, "Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?": 1, "Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need.": 1, "Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?": 1, "Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?": 1, "Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?": 1, "Tell you what, I'll sell it back to you for 4,000 coins.": 1, "Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together.": 1, "Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!": 1, "Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm.": 1, "Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.": 1, "Thank you for coming to dinner, Hogni.": 1, "Thank you for bringing this to my attention.": 1, "Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble.": 1, "Thank you for breaking that foul vampire's hold over me.": 1, "Thank you for asking.": 1, "Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know.": 1, "Thank you again. I can't believe I was this close to being killed.": 1, "Thank you again for resolving my... problem.": 1, "Thank you again for all the help.": 1, "Thank you Klimmek. That's too kind.": 1, "Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.": 1, "Thank the gods for the end of yet another pointless conversation...": 1, "Thank the divines for you!": 1, "Thank the Divines we survived that.": 1, "Thank the All-Maker that you have come. These accursed elves have taken me from my home.": 1, "Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now.": 1, "Terrible shame, what happened to those women.": 1, "Terrible times.": 1, "Terrible, simply terrible.": 1, "Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!": 1, "Testing this will require some extra precautions, I think.": 1, "Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.": 1, "Tell me when you are ready, mortal.": 1, "Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name.": 1, "Thane Bryling, at your service.": 1, "Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?": 1, "Thank Kynareth for you, stranger. I'd almost given up hope of walking away from here.": 1, "Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.": 1, "Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!": 1, "Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.": 1, "Thalmor, to arms! Kill the intruder!": 1, "Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.": 1, "Someday I will inherit all of this. It's worth a little pain.": 1, "Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass.": 1, "Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one.": 1, "Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills.": 1, "Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all.": 1, "Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to.": 1, "Shadows take me...": 1, "Shadows creep, and... and phantoms leap! A man got... he got scared. And the demons dared! To um... visit upon him all which they feared!": 1, "Shadows consume you.": 1, "Shadowmere, my old and dear friend...": 1, "Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel.": 1, "Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.": 1, "Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.": 1, "Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon. ": 1, "Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk.": 1, "Set my hatred aside? Not a chance. It's what keeps me strong.": 1, "Shall we continue the fight?": 1, "Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.": 1, "Serve House Redoran, or serve no one.": 1, "Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself.": 1, "Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?": 1, "Serana?": 1, "Serana, my darling. I see you still favor keeping a pet.": 1, "Serana isn't yours, she's mine!": 1, "Serana has sacrificed everything to prevent Harkon from completing the prophecy. I would have expected her to explain that to you.": 1, "Serana can make you one of us again.": 1, "Serana can change that. I suggest you ask her to.": 1, "Serana and her mother disappeared long ago.": 1, "Sera?": 1, "Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here.": 1, "Separated from their people on the mainland, they developed a distinct culture that became the Skaal we know today.": 1, "Sentries! What do you see?": 1, "Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper.": 1, "Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?": 1, "Shall we get on with it?": 1, "Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up.": 1, "She hardly mentions anything else. ": 1, "She had to be up to something in that garden. I'm hoping it's a clue that will tell us where she went.": 1, "She had an alchemy setup in her drawing room, but nothing that even comes close to what's here.": 1, "She had a theory about soul gems. That the souls inside of them don't just vanish when they're used... they end up in the Soul Cairn.": 1, "She had a room here. Might talk to the innkeeper about it.": 1, "She had a book with her, \"Song of the Alchemists,\" that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy.": 1, "She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and...  never woke up.": 1, "She gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.": 1, "She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate.": 1, "She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.": 1, "She fights well enough, for a Skaal.": 1, "She doesn't have the scar.": 1, "She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others.": 1, "She died when I was very young.": 1, "Shall we proceed, friend?": 1, "She died out there, only having tended to the wounded soldiers for a few months. We never even found her body... the Empire burned all the dead.": 1, "She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later.": 1, "She could be someone again if she was given the chance.": 1, "She can't tell me what to do!": 1, "She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.": 1, "She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really.": 1, "She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.": 1, "She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her.": 1, "She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.": 1, "She always seemed happy, before we heard the prophecy. Then it all changed. She became a different person. They both did.": 1, "She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.": 1, "She actually did it... created a portal to the Soul Cairn. Incredible.": 1, "Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay.": 1, "Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name.": 1, "Shameful, really. I blame the parents. ": 1, "She died in some experiment Master Neloth did on her. He claimed she wanted him to.": 1, "Sending the occasional message back and forth is all we can manage, and sometimes takes months or more to arrive.": 1, "Send them to Oblivion!": 1, "Send the word. \"A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.\"": 1, "See? She agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?": 1, "See? I told you. Just where the map said it would be.": 1, "See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!": 1, "See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.": 1, "See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?": 1, "See, that wasn't so hard, now was it.": 1, "See, that kind of attitude comes from someone who wants to get rich and stay alive long enough to enjoy it. We're goin' to get along nicely.": 1, "See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son.": 1, "See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff.": 1, "See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire.": 1, "See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought.": 1, "See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that.": 1, "See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine.": 1, "See you on the other side, mortal.": 1, "Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.": 1, "See you in the mines!": 1, "See you around... if you live long enough.": 1, "See you around.": 1, "See you around, my beauty.": 1, "See you around, handsome.": 1, "See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.": 1, "See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.": 1, "See what a warrior of true mettle is like.": 1, "See those things in the alcoves up there? 'Kinetic Resonators', the dwarves called them. Strike them in the right order, and the doors should open.": 1, "See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!": 1, "See the Resonators up there? Strike them in the right order, and the doors should open.": 1, "See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.": 1, "See that you do. You're an embarrassment, Horgeir. I don't know why I married you.": 1, "See that you do. We can't afford to let these traitors slip away.": 1, "See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.": 1, "See you in Sovngarde.": 1, "Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.": 1, "Seek him out to the south. Be cautious, Dragonborn. There is something else at work here.": 1, "Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.": 1, "Send the troll after them!": 1, "Send the Skaal shaman to me. He holds the secrets that will be mine.": 1, "Send him back where he came from.": 1, "Send her back where she came from.": 1, "Send another one in here! Send two! I don't care!": 1, "Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister.": 1, "Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.": 1, "Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too. ": 1, "Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays.": 1, "Seems you're the court favorite. At least, for the moment.": 1, "Seems we're all branded villains these days...": 1, "Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you.": 1, "Seems to me like it just ended... it's never really ended for me.": 1, "Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?": 1, "Seems there's always more to be done...": 1, "Seems the previous incarnation of the Dawnguard had, at one time, some interesting toys.": 1, "Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take.": 1, "Seeking passage to Solstheim?": 1, "Seeking passage to Windhelm?": 1, "Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.": 1, "Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job.": 1, "Seems I still remember my old training.": 1, "Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.": 1, "She has confirmed that Miraak is the one behind the suffering of our people.": 1, "Seems a bit short to me.": 1, "Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over.": 1, "Seems like most of these are nine parts fiction.": 1, "Seems like nobody is willing to put their life on the line for research any more.": 1, "Seems like things are looking up in Raven Rock now that the mine's open. It's a nice change.": 1, "Seems no one in this city has.": 1, "Seems that I'm the only of my kind here. Suppose I shouldn't be surprised.": 1, "Seems friendly enough. Obviously intelligent. Why do you ask?": 1, "See that thing? Dwarves called them 'Kinetic Resonators'. Don't see them very often, least not among the clans in Skyrim.": 1, "She has no idea what she's getting herself into. You may not always be there to take care of her.": 1, "She hasn't been in traveling condition for quite a while now. I've tried to let her go off on her own but she insists on staying here.": 1, "Sheogorath's madness take you!": 1, "Sheogorath's beard, you're an ugly one.": 1, "Sheogorath take fools like you, put that down.": 1, "Sheathe your weapons and come quietly!": 1, "She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!  ": 1, "She... she said that? She said those words... to you?  \"Darkness rises when silence dies\"?": 1, "She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you.": 1, "She... She didn't make it.": 1, "She's... she's a vampire? Are you a complete fool? You can't trust them! She'll turn on you the first chance she gets!": 1, "She's watching over the others. Look alive now.": 1, "She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!": 1, "She's threatened by me! By my skill as a wizard, by my elegance and posture, by my superior good looks!": 1, "She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.": 1, "She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place.": 1, "Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service.": 1, "She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse.": 1, "She's probably the one you ought to talk to.": 1, "She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?": 1, "She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.": 1, "She's not from Markarth. The air about her screamed \"outsider.\"": 1, "She's not a little girl anymore, Fethis. When are you going to let her go?": 1, "She's mine! She's my reward. You can't have her!": 1, "She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.": 1, "She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.": 1, "She's jealous. Can't say that I blame her.": 1, "She's holed up in Highpoint Tower.": 1, "She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!": 1, "She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim.": 1, "She's dead? Oh my. Master Neloth is not going to be happy to hear that.": 1, "She's dead. Laelette is dead.": 1, "She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest.": 1, "She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!": 1, "Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand.": 1, "Shh. You mustn't speak about such things away from the shrine. Only you and your dinner guests can know.": 1, "Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use...": 1, "Should we consider investigating the matter?": 1, "Should they accept her rule, we will have peace.": 1, "Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish.": 1, "Should have picked somebody else for your dinner.": 1, "Should have left when you had the chance, friend. Now we're gonna have to spill your brains on the road here.": 1, "Should have known you'd be a cheap one.": 1, "Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls. ": 1, "Should have known better than to challenge a master wizard of the House Telvanni.": 1, "Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.": 1, "Should have figured Astrid would send you.": 1, "Should be fun.": 1, "Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?": 1, "Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.": 1, "Shh!": 1, "Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this...": 1, "Shor's bones, what happened to you, boy?": 1, "Shor's bones, I might just have to!": 1, "Shor's bones, I hope you're right.": 1, "Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...": 1, "Shor's blood, what have they done?": 1, "Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?": 1, "Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her.": 1, "Shor's Bones! What... what's in this?": 1, "Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.": 1, "Shor have mercy on you!": 1, "Shop at Belethor's for the best prices and selection. He pays me to say that.": 1, "Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me.": 1, "Shhh. You'll scare the deer.": 1, "Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk.": 1, "Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.": 1, "She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild.": 1, "She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.": 1, "She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.": 1, "She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.": 1, "She used to be richer than Councilor Morvayn and she's spending it all drowning her sorrow.": 1, "She thought she could hide from me, but she can't!": 1, "She thinks that old age has addled my mind... that I'm seeing things when there's nothing to be seen.": 1, "She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.": 1, "She still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me.": 1, "She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life.": 1, "She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.": 1, "She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.": 1, "She said you stay in there, and that's final.": 1, "She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.": 1, "She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?": 1, "She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us.": 1, "She repaid our kindness by attacking us in the middle of the night.": 1, "She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor.": 1, "She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'.": 1, "She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.": 1, "She needs to learn to eat what I serve her. I swear, you spoil that child rotten. Besides, it's one of your favorites.": 1, "She might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.": 1, "She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers.": 1, "She lives. Seek her in Highpoint Tower.": 1, "She let Master Neloth do some ritual thing to her. We buried her out back.": 1, "She left for Raven Rock hours ago. She promised to bring me back some fresh blisterwort.": 1, "She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt.": 1, "She just wouldn't hear it.": 1, "She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.": 1, "She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.": 1, "She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.": 1, "She influences our luck and in return demands payment.": 1, "She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.": 1, "She persuaded an elven artisan to make some improvements. You can see the plates that show the phases of the moons, Masser and Secunda.": 1, "She volunteered for one of my experiments involving heart stones.": 1, "She wanted to get it as far away from my father as possible. I can't imagine a better place.": 1, "She wanted to play with me forever and ever.": 1, "She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.": 1, "She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her.": 1, "She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire.": 1, "She's always been quick to shame.": 1, "She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her.": 1, "She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late.": 1, "She's a traveler, from the Imperial City. Came by every day looking for jewelry for her relatives back home.": 1, "She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of \"where\" than \"who.\"": 1, "She's a girl. She cried. ": 1, "She's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.": 1, "She'll make a fine wife someday.": 1, "She'll definitely know where it is, and if we're lucky, she actually has it herself.": 1, "She wouldn't have to be there at all, if it weren't for Roggvir.": 1, "She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right.": 1, "She would have hated to see it like this.": 1, "She worried about me. About all of us. But she wanted to get me as far away from my father as possible before he really went over the edge.": 1, "She won't tell me her name.": 1, "She wants the city this badly, she can fight me for it.": 1, "She was a headstrong one. Always pushing Master Neloth to teach her more.": 1, "She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair.": 1, "She was caught in a terrible snowstorm while returning home from gathering firewood.": 1, "She was hurt so bad. We took pity on her and nursed her back to health.": 1, "She was only interested in magic and power.": 1, "She has the scroll!": 1, "She was practically smirking as we left home. Almost like she was proud of herself. ": 1, "She was very fond of her alchemical garden in the castle courtyard. She taught me quite a bit about cultivating quality reagents.": 1, "She wasn't, always. But I think you're right.": 1, "She watched while we ate it, and when she saw how much we loved it, she was... so proud...": 1, "She what?": 1, "She will certainly be missed.": 1, "She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice.": 1, "She was so sure of what we did to my father, I couldn't help but go along with her. I never thought of the cost.": 1, "Should you run out of magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do.": 1, "See that thing?": 1, "See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares.": 1, "Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are! ": 1, "Rieklings. You must have passed by the hall on your way down here? Well, it's been overrun.": 1, "Rieklings.": 1, "Ride strong.": 1, "Riches are a gate-opener around here. Head right in.": 1, "Riches and fortune, within my grasp, and I have to give it all up because they're afraid of a few dead bodies...": 1, "Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him.": 1, "Rhiada, did you clean the tables today? They're filthy!": 1, "Reyda! Reyyyyda!": 1, "Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished.": 1, "Reyda was here, then gone. Went to gather plants and never came home... nope, nope.": 1, "Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.": 1, "Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up.": 1, "Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul.": 1, "Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.": 1, "Revenge? How interesting...": 1, "Revel in your new powers, but do not forget who gave them to you.": 1, "Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him.": 1, "Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever.": 1, "Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.": 1, "Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!": 1, "Return to me when your part is done. And may you enjoy your second nuptials.": 1, "Return the gloves to me when you have finished.": 1, "Return now to Nirn, with this rich boon from Shor, my lord: a Shout to bring a hero from Sovngarde in your hour of need.": 1, "Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things...": 1, "Return here with Stalhrim weapons and armor, and I will pay you a fair price for them.": 1, "Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.": 1, "Return anytime you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.": 1, "Retrieve that shield at all costs.": 1, "Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.": 1, "Revel in your power.": 1, "Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!": 1, "Riften denies the Emperor. You are here illegally. Stand down and you will be arrested and tried in the morning. Resist and you will die.": 1, "Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.": 1, "Right. Till next time.": 1, "Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters.": 1, "Right. So they have this woman, and an Elder Scroll.": 1, "Right. See you around.": 1, "Right. Okay, tell me if you change yer mind.": 1, "Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.": 1, "Right. I'll settle in and then Arkay and I will start to put things right. Don't you worry.": 1, "Right. Happy trails.": 1, "Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling.": 1, "Right. And what did you say the point of this little venture was?": 1, "Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good.": 1, "Right, then...": 1, "Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else.": 1, "Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks.": 1, "Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.": 1, "Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts...": 1, "Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer.": 1, "Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.": 1, "Right to the point, aren't you. I like that. Not like those fools in the order.": 1, "Right then. Let's be off.": 1, "Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get.": 1, "Right now, the Guild needs someone to maintain order. Everyone is awaiting the news of Mercer's demise; it couldn't be a more precarious time.": 1, "Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl.": 1, "Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.": 1, "Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!": 1, "Right away, sir!": 1, "Right away, milord.": 1, "Right away, milady.": 1, "Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun.": 1, "Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town.": 1, "Right, I really am busy. So...": 1, "Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow.": 1, "Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.": 1, "Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge.": 1, "Remember, I'm not leaving until Harkon's no longer a threat.": 1, "Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying.": 1, "Remember, I have plenty of potions and ingredients if you're ever in the market.": 1, "Remember your place, and you'll be taken care of.": 1, "Remember your lessons, Attendant.": 1, "Remember what happened to Storn.": 1, "Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!": 1, "Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.": 1, "Remember to hunt only when you have need.": 1, "Remember to give at the temple.": 1, "Remember the passphrase: \"Silence, my brother.\"": 1, "Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.": 1, "Remember that you chose this path.": 1, "Remember that old rusty sword I had? Damn thing must have had over a hundred chips in it.": 1, "Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun.": 1, "Remember that Harkon isn't to be trusted. No matter what he promises, he'll deceive you in order to get what he wants.": 1, "Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.": 1, "Remember Majni's pack, at Frostmoon Crag. Now, I must be off. The blood calls.": 1, "Remember Cloud Ruler Temple!": 1, "Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.": 1, "Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.": 1, "Relonikiv, ziil los dii du!": 1, "Rellicus lived there for quite a long time, working in the other sections of the mine until he was slain by reavers.": 1, "Religion isn't going to save me. So unless Mara is going to start raining coin from the heavens, why don't you mind your own business.": 1, "Relieved... I think.": 1, "Relief and gratitude": 1, "Release...me.": 1, "Release the Miasma! Release it now! Hurry, Casimir, hurry!": 1, "Release me, and I'll share a bit of my wealth with you.": 1, "Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business.": 1, "Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.": 1, "Remember, being a bard isn't just about the music.": 1, "Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true.": 1, "Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong.": 1, "Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?": 1, "Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by.": 1, "Represent us well, sister.": 1, "Represent us well, brother.": 1, "Report to Isran at Fort Dawnguard. And get moving if you're serious about it. The vampires aren't going to wait around to make their next move.": 1, "Report back to me if you discover anything unusual.": 1, "Repel the invader!": 1, "Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.": 1, "Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.": 1, "Remind me not to make you angry.": 1, "Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.": 1, "Remember... hit the one in the middle!": 1, "Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.": 1, "Remember. Ale is cheaper than blood in Markarth.": 1, "Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!": 1, "Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have.": 1, "Remember, you are no mere vampire. You are something far greater.": 1, "Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Mostly.": 1, "Remember, it's your job to \"deliver\" these songs. To excite the crowd. Draw them in and they will love you for it.": 1, "Remember, keep this to yourself.": 1, "Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference.": 1, "Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own.": 1, "Remember, the Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Just beneath the road, and away from prying eyes.": 1, "Right. Well, you can relax. I have it under control.": 1, "Remember, this is between us now.": 1, "Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid.": 1, "Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in.": 1, "Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus.": 1, "Remember, we're not looking for trouble. We need to get to Kynesgrove as fast as we can.": 1, "Remember, we're watching you.": 1, "Remember, when you kill - we all wield the blade.": 1, "Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.": 1, "See that they stay that way, or else I'll send you back to Skyrim in a crate. You understand me?": 1, "Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything.": 1, "Right. Well?": 1, "Say hello to Verulus for me.": 1, "Say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me.": 1, "Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.": 1, "Savros? Ha! He wouldn't be fit to be my apprentice.": 1, "Savos. Before... before he died.": 1, "Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?": 1, "Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.": 1, "Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.": 1, "Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.": 1, "Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time.": 1, "Saviour of Morrowind. Hm, that's good but it sounds too narrow of scope...": 1, "Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.": 1, "Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.": 1, "Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.": 1, "Say no more. I was wondering what you were doing here... I'm glad to play my part.": 1, "Save it for the battlefield.": 1, "Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him.": 1, "Sauranach mine is open again. How am I supposed to handle all this work?": 1, "Sate your thirst for knowledge in the endless stacks of my library.": 1, "Saraan uth - I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?": 1, "Samuel is getting to be a problem. Fancies himself something of a \"leader\" to the other children. Put an end to the nonsense, or I will.": 1, "Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table.": 1, "Salmon sounds good today.": 1, "Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.": 1, "Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months.": 1, "Sahrotaar, ziil los dii du!": 1, "Sahrotaar, are you so easily swayed?": 1, "Sahrot thur qahnaraan": 1, "Sahloknir, krii daar joorre.": 1, "Saffir!": 1, "Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him.": 1, "Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?": 1, "Say on, friend. What do you need?": 1, "Say, how would you like to help advance the art of magic?": 1, "See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.": 1, "See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not.": 1, "See me at my forge if you need arms or armor.": 1, "See into other people's thoughts!": 1, "See if you can unlock that door.": 1, "See if you can get the door open.": 1, "See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.": 1, "See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back.": 1, "See if you can find a pattern in the sequence. Most of these locks have a pattern of some kind.": 1, "See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.": 1, "See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.": 1, "See if one of these chests has some armor for you.": 1, "Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit.": 1, "Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.": 1, "Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?": 1, "Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?": 1, "Secret hidden things!": 1, "Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations.": 1, "Second, we have the \"White-Gold Tower\" which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top.": 1, "Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon.": 1, "Second Councilor Arano is concerned that once word reaches the reavers that the mine has reopened, they might think about paying us a visit.": 1, "Second Councilor Adrano can assist you with anything you might need.": 1, "Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.": 1, "Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.": 1, "Scourge of nature!": 1, "Scions of the night! Hear my words!": 1, "Scattered across Tamriel are secluded locations known only as Ancestor Glades. There's one in Skyrim, in the Pine Forest.": 1, "Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!": 1, "Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?": 1, "Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts.": 1, "Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.": 1, "Safe? You call bringing her here safe? Has she explained nothing to you?": 1, "Safe travels, outlander.": 1, "Safe travels, landstrider.": 1, "Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.": 1, "Rrrraaaaahhhh!": 1, "Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.": 1, "Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see.": 1, "Roo cha!": 1, "Ronthil, where is the last batch of alchemy ingredients I asked you for?": 1, "Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again.": 1, "Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.": 1, "Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?": 1, "Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg.": 1, "Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.": 1, "Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.": 1, "Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?": 1, "Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.": 1, "Ruki? Where is she?": 1, "Roggi and I do the work around here. My wife and brats just sit around on their brains wasting time.": 1, "Rocks and valley, crevices and hiding places. This is the kind of place where hermits and fanatics dwell.": 1, "Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.": 1, "Ro fus... maybe you only balance the forces that work to quicken the end of this world.": 1, "Ro Dah!": 1, "Riverwood's in danger, too? You'd better go on in. You'll find the Jarl in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.": 1, "Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village.": 1, "Riverwood looks peaceful. If I had to settle in Skyrim, this might be the place I'd choose.": 1, "Rise up and live again!": 1, "Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!": 1, "Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun to your table!": 1, "Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale!": 1, "Rikke. You don't have to do this.": 1, "Rikke. Go.": 1, "Right... Helgen..": 1, "Rogatus and I have been married over 50 years. He's always been a bit of a grouch.": 1, "Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like.": 1, "Rumor has it they can get you anything for the right price.": 1, "Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.": 1, "Safe travels to you.": 1, "Safe journeys, sword-brother.": 1, "Sadly, yes. It's the inevitable fate we agree to pursue when reading the Elder Scrolls.": 1, "Sadly, yes. Even the townsfolk have taken to calling her \"Grelod the Kind.\" Her very existence has become something of a running joke.": 1, "Sadly, we've been unable to use the Ancestral Tomb beneath the Temple as of late, and have resorted to other locations to scatter the remains.": 1, "Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all.": 1, "Sadly, the magic used to construct these wonders were lost long before I arrived here.": 1, "Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city.": 1, "Sadly, no. She died in Falkreath, where I was born.": 1, "Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure.": 1, "Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds. ": 1, "Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started.": 1, "Sad to see her go, of course. But Bujold wouldn't have gotten as far as she did if she wasn't strong. She'll... she'll be ok.": 1, "Sacked by the elves in the infamous \"Night of Tears,\" not much is known about what happened to Saarthal.": 1, "Saadia, wake up dear!": 1, "Saadia dear?": 1, "Ruth wah nivahriin joor!": 1, "Run fast, my friend.": 1, "Run for it!": 1, "Run, coward! Run and never return!": 1, "Run, coward! Run back to the filthy Dawnguard!": 1, "Run, coward! You're a traitor to your race!": 1, "Run, you idiot!": 1, "Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you.": 1, "Running a little light in the pockets, lad?": 1, "Running is your only chance to live.": 1, "Running will warm your blood nicely.": 1, "Running won't save you.": 1, "Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up.": 1, "Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless.": 1, "Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move to Hammerfell.": 1, "Running a little light in the pockets, lass?": 1, "Should your blushing bride go missing, perhaps unable to bear the thought of living with a... a monster...": 1, "Should your husband go missing, perhaps unable to bear the thought of living with a... a monster...": 1, "Should've known.": 1, "So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.": 1, "So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that.": 1, "So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about.": 1, "So you're telling me you and Sam just sent me in there to die, then? I want my money, you bastard.": 1, "So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.": 1, "So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise.": 1, "So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did.": 1, "So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.": 1, "So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!": 1, "So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.": 1, "So you want to play hide and seek, eh?": 1, "So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.": 1, "So you think you can steal from me?": 1, "So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?": 1, "So you're the one from the... Dark Brotherhood? I need you to kill the Big Laborer at Katla's Farm. Here's the gold for the kill. Make it painful.": 1, "So you take a major decision for me, and make it all about you?": 1, "So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.": 1, "So you saw a dragon, did you? Tell me, what was it like? As big as a house?": 1, "So you really are...": 1, "So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone.": 1, "So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.": 1, "So you know my purpose here, then? I suppose you must have found that dullard of a blacksmith.": 1, "So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor.": 1, "So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that.": 1, "So you have slain Alduin... Well done. I could have slain him myself, back when I walked the earth, but I chose a different path.": 1, "So you found the Moth Priest. Let's see you find the rest of the Elder Scrolls all on your own.": 1, "So you finally tracked down old Crescius, eh? Quite a character, isn't he.": 1, "So you don't know anything about this house?": 1, "So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit.": 1, "So you do have something, then.": 1, "So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted.": 1, "So you chose to day to die...": 1, "So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!": 1, "So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?": 1, "So, it begins.": 1, "So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?": 1, "So, in case you didn't notice the giant thing on my back, I have the Elder Scroll with me.": 1, "So, if you've got the nerve, I've got plenty of extra jobs to help get the Guild back on its feet.": 1, "So, if you'd be a dear and collect those plans for me?": 1, "So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs.": 1, "So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this.": 1, "So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting.": 1, "So, have you thought about what I said?": 1, "So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?": 1, "So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet? ": 1, "So, has my bow turned up yet?": 1, "So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?": 1, "So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous.": 1, "So you're the... the assassin? I need you to kill the Visiting Noble at Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. Here's the gold. I... I hope it's enough.": 1, "So, any luck? Was Tolan right about the vampires being interested in Dimhollow Crypt?": 1, "So, another seeker after knowledge enters my realm.": 1, "So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?": 1, "So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?": 1, "So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?": 1, "So, Sapphire. Can I do anything for you, or more to the point... to you?": 1, "So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?": 1, "So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?": 1, "So, Ildari does live after all.": 1, "So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately.": 1, "So, I see this dragon has fangs.": 1, "So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?": 1, "So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?": 1, "So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.": 1, "So you've said a hundred times. But didn't you also tell me the Telvanni lands were green and lush?": 1, "So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?": 1, "So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead.": 1, "So you can be helpful sometimes.": 1, "So you as good as admit you're working for the Imperials. Yet you walk in here, and ask to join me. What are you playing at?": 1, "So this is the grand tour of Skyrim's caves that you're showing me?": 1, "So this is the fabled College of Winterhold. Amazing.": 1, "So this is it...": 1, "So this is Riften. Glover Mallory told me a good deal about the place. It looks exactly as I'd pictured.": 1, "So this is Raven Rock, eh? Not all that much to look at.": 1, "So they have everything they wanted, and we're left with nothing.": 1, "So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water. Marvelous.": 1, "So the stories are true... you are Dragonborn!": 1, "So the stories are true... the dragons have returned. But why?": 1, "So the dragons have returned. Well, the Skaal have survived worse.": 1, "So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone.": 1, "So the clues point to the Treasury House, then. That makes sense. Thonar is involved in every facet of the city.": 1, "So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.": 1, "So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.": 1, "So this is where Delphine has been hiding all these years? Hmm.": 1, "So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas.  ": 1, "So that's where you went!": 1, "So that's it, then. \"Don't come back.\"": 1, "So that's how it's going to be, huh? Fine. Take your best shot!": 1, "So that's a no I take it?": 1, "So that is how you treat others?": 1, "So thanks.": 1, "So tell me... how's my brother Delvin? Still spending his nights at the Ragged Flagon trying to win Vex's heart?": 1, "So tell me, did Aringoth enjoy your visit?": 1, "So tantalizingly close... But trust me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if it could.": 1, "So soon? You must be hungry for a deal.": 1, "So sick... can hardly stand it...": 1, "So serious! (Laughter)": 1, "So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest.": 1, "So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!": 1, "So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand.": 1, "So this is where your Vigilants came from? No wonder you look so lost all the time.": 1, "So this is your plan, Lucan?": 1, "So to protect me you decided to shut me away from everything I cared about?": 1, "So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.": 1, "So why don't you just drink the blood from the spring? I mean, that seems easier than running a skooma den...": 1, "So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.": 1, "So who's winning now?": 1, "So who are you? What do you want?": 1, "So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen.": 1, "So where is it? ": 1, "So where do you hail from, Glover?": 1, "So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could.": 1, "So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "So what's your story? Just here to... relax?": 1, "So what's the news on the street, Captain?": 1, "So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!": 1, "So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?": 1, "So what do you think, Vendil? You think this town will survive?": 1, "So what do you have to say for yourself? How can I be sure you're not an Imperial spy?": 1, "So what can I get you?": 1, "So unless you're here to dig, you don't belong here.": 1, "So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!": 1, "So we grab it and we get out, right?": 1, "So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra. ": 1, "So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.": 1, "So we shall expose to them the falseness in their hearts by tearing out yours, Deceiver!": 1, "So, it is done. Alduin dilon. The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been.": 1, "So we shall rip the falsehood from their breasts by tearing the false heart from yours!": 1, "So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants.": 1, "So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it.": 1, "So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to.": 1, "So we're not turning back, you fool.": 1, "So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?": 1, "So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?": 1, "So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?": 1, "So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends.": 1, "So, it is real...": 1, "So, let's get this straight.": 1, "Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?": 1, "Some folks say it's \"enchanted ice,\" but I think there's more to it than that.": 1, "Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation.": 1, "Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?": 1, "Some folk - they got no shame.": 1, "Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.": 1, "Some day, brother. Some day.": 1, "Some day soon, you will all see battle. And what you do here, today, may well save your lives!": 1, "Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.": 1, "Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!": 1, "Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...": 1, "Some dark influence wields power over them, forces them to forget themselves and act against their nature.": 1, "Some consider my methods harsh, but playing the coddling nursemaid has never won a battle.": 1, "Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire.": 1, "Some gate guard you were!": 1, "Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it.": 1, "Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.": 1, "Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.": 1, "Solsthiem is still rich in ebony ore. I know there's more down there... I can smell it.": 1, "Solstheim is theoretically under my rule, but without revenue from the mine, I lack the resources to actually govern anything but Raven Rock itself.": 1, "Solstheim is a fascinating place, but we know so little about its past. There are many mysteries that remain unsolved.": 1, "Solstheim has no use for your kind!": 1, "Solitude... home to the East Empire Company, the heartless bastards.": 1, "Soldiers, townspeople, and dregs into the keep!": 1, "Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.": 1, "Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.": 1, "Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?": 1, "So? So?": 1, "So? Do you have it? Did you get my book?": 1, "So?": 1, "Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready.": 1, "So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.": 1, "Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!": 1, "Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.": 1, "Some wine, please?": 1, "Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock.": 1, "Some sort of trickery is at work here.": 1, "Some see only blank pages, and nobody knows why. Perhaps some of us are born with no destiny, or maybe the blank pages signify an imminent death.": 1, "Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. ": 1, "Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree.": 1, "Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way.": 1, "Some say Ulfric desires to be king and nothing more... have they not seen that his anger floats on a sea of tears?": 1, "Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.": 1, "Some say Alduin is Akatosh. Some say M'aiq is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things.": 1, "Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths.": 1, "Some pretty flowers. I picked them all by myself!": 1, "Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know.": 1, "Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like.": 1, "Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.": 1, "Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.": 1, "Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?": 1, "Some other time, then.": 1, "Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.": 1, "Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning.": 1, "Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.": 1, "Some of them, anyway. ": 1, "Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.": 1, "Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!": 1, "Some of the more powerful among them can exert their influence within our world, and when they do, men inevitably suffer.": 1, "Some of the Redoran Guard have taken to calling them \"ash spawn.\"": 1, "Some of my own men have become quite accustomed to a spirit they called \"Emberbrand Wine.\"": 1, "Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.": 1, "Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again.": 1, "Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim.": 1, "Some parting advice - women love sonnets.": 1, "So... you don't deny this?": 1, "So... what do you plan on doing?": 1, "So... we're done?": 1, "So, what is the first special ingredient?": 1, "So, what is it? What have you done?": 1, "So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?": 1, "So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?": 1, "So, what do we have here? Hmm. Let me guess.": 1, "So, what book should I read to you tonight?": 1, "So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?": 1, "So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard.": 1, "So, we only need one more of these... cubes?": 1, "So, we meet again.": 1, "So, unearthly screams, don't come up. Got it.": 1, "So, um, mind if I buy you a drink?": 1, "So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.": 1, "So, this was my old stomping grounds. Not the most normal childhood.": 1, "So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?": 1, "So, this is snow elf magic. Incredible.": 1, "So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal.": 1, "So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official.": 1, "So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.": 1, "So, the same then.": 1, "So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?": 1, "So, the mage needs to be \"taken care of,\" if you understand me.": 1, "So, the ending of my tale I began earlier...": 1, "So, the deed has been done. My brother is dead.": 1, "So, the deed has been done.": 1, "So, the beast is destroyed.": 1, "So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time.": 1, "So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!": 1, "So, not much has changed, really.": 1, "So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game.": 1, "So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.": 1, "So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?": 1, "So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice.": 1, "So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good.": 1, "So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up...": 1, "So... very tired...": 1, "So... this is the place.": 1, "So... once again the Key has been stolen and a \"champion\" returns it to the Sepulcher.": 1, "So... carrying that weapon around like that makes you feel safe, does it?": 1, "So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.": 1, "So... I've been thinking... I'm grateful we're friends. I'd like you to have this. It's not much, but I hope it's something you like.": 1, "So. You're one of Ulfric's spies...": 1, "So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting...": 1, "So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?": 1, "So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want.": 1, "So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood.": 1, "So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well.": 1, "So, you've returned.": 1, "So, you've returned from Mzinchaleft! A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. Assuming Maluril is actually... dead?": 1, "So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule.": 1, "So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects.": 1, "So, you are smart enough to surrender to a master wizard of the House Telvanni.": 1, "So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after.": 1, "So, you don't need anything then.": 1, "So, you have seen things, yes? My magic grows weak, and so does the barrier around our village. Time is short. Tell me what you know.": 1, "So, you in?": 1, "So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right... you are dangerous.": 1, "So, it's to the pain then!": 1, "So, you need a guide out of town after all?": 1, "So, you think he's just crazy?": 1, "So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me.": 1, "So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal.": 1, "So, you're here to help?": 1, "So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?": 1, "So, you're the new recruit, eh?": 1, "So, you reveal yourself!": 1, "So now we're rich and now I'm chief. ": 1, "So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!": 1, "So now he's dead.": 1, "Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over.": 1, "Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town.": 1, "Skald is very... vocal about his hatred of the Empire.": 1, "Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?": 1, "Skaggi is in charge, not me.": 1, "Sithis? Let me guess: \"In the Void!\" By the gods, you Dark Brotherhood are a predictable lot, aren't you?": 1, "Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister.": 1, "Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother.": 1, "Sit down and enjoy yourself.": 1, "Sister, how is my fortune coming along?": 1, "Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work.": 1, "Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.": 1, "Sir? How quaint.": 1, "Sir?": 1, "Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request.": 1, "Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!": 1, "Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve.": 1, "Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before.": 1, "Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any moment!": 1, "Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders.": 1, "Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter.": 1, "Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?": 1, "Sir, are you serious?": 1, "Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost.": 1, "Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further. ": 1, "Sir, I tried.": 1, "Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!": 1, "Sir! I... I have... <breathing hard>": 1, "Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?": 1, "Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions.": 1, "Sir, we really must talk.": 1, "Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?": 1, "Skeever-brain!": 1, "Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest.": 1, "Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.": 1, "Skyrim will be purged of your filth!": 1, "Skyrim will be free!": 1, "Skyrim was once the land of many butterflies. Now, not so much.": 1, "Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great.": 1, "Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be. ": 1, "Skyrim needs people like you, if we ever hope to regain our freedom from the damned Empire. Good luck.": 1, "Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same.": 1, "Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way.": 1, "Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace.": 1, "Skyrim is ours!": 1, "Skyrim is filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.": 1, "Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears.": 1, "Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric.": 1, "Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.": 1, "Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.": 1, "Skyforge Steel is my art and honor. The Companions need the best, so they come to me.": 1, "Skyforge Steel is all the Companions will use, for good reason.": 1, "Sky above, Voice within.": 1, "Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.": 1, "Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern.": 1, "Skuli's father is off fighting for the Stormcloaks. I'm sure he's just fine.": 1, "Skuli's father is off fighting for the Empire. I'm sure he's just fine.": 1, "Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms.": 1, "Skuldafn fen kos dinok.": 1, "Skooma! Lovely skooma. But I'd sooner give it up than go work for her.": 1, "Skooma addict. Get lost.": 1, "Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible. ": 1, "Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.": 1, "Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts. ": 1, "Skyrim belongs to the Nords!": 1, "Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?": 1, "Since you're brimming with self-confidence, maybe you'd care to take over for me?": 1, "Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.": 1, "Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.": 1, "Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there.": 1, "Sigh. What is it now, dear?": 1, "Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.": 1, "Sigh. I don't care what you, or anyone else thinks about me.": 1, "Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?": 1, "Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.": 1, "Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.": 1, "Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out.": 1, "Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business.": 1, "Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.": 1, "Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.": 1, "Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?": 1, "Shut up. Only the gods can judge me. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?": 1, "Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.": 1, "Shut up, scum.": 1, "Shut up back there!": 1, "Shut it, Kleppr. Thongvor isn't here, so save your kissing up for a Nord who cares.": 1, "Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander.": 1, "Show yourself.": 1, "Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!": 1, "Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.": 1, "Show me you are the hero they say you are!": 1, "Show me what you've got!": 1, "Show me that you can support a child. Buy a house. Furnish it. Then come back, and we'll talk.": 1, "Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?": 1, "Shouldn't you be helping me then, wife of mine? Sharing my problems? Being my better half?": 1, "Shouldn't we keep moving? I really want to get back home.": 1, "Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?": 1, "Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...": 1, "Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock...": 1, "Sigh... fine, take whatever you want, so long as you help me get rid of Vals.": 1, "Sigrid! Love of my life! When you get a spare moment, I could use some water.": 1, "Sigrid! We have company!": 1, "Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now.": 1, "Since you paid my fee recently, I suppose it's only fair that I join you once more.": 1, "Since you could've attacked me before now, I'm going to assume this was a little accident on your part.": 1, "Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments.": 1, "Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their \"guild\" and you should be cautious.": 1, "Since there aren't any Ulens left on this island, I've taken it upon myself to leave the traditional offering in their stead.": 1, "Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can.": 1, "Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can.": 1, "Since the ash yam is born of the very same soil, it represents rebirth and renewal... the fact that life ends and begins anew.": 1, "Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge. ": 1, "Since the Severin family... or whoever they were...turned out to be criminals, their property is now forfeit.": 1, "Since the Keepers weren't able to claim my soul, they had their minions construct a barrier that I'd never be able to breach.": 1, "Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute.": 1, "Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day.": 1, "Since it's your first time... sure. Find a booth and enjoy.": 1, "Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are.": 1, "Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject.": 1, "Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?": 1, "Silus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history.": 1, "Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.": 1, "Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing.": 1, "Simple. He says 'kill', I kill.": 1, "Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild.": 1, "Skyrim. Born and raised.": 1, "Simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand.": 1, "Simply fascinating.": 1, "Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans.": 1, "Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.": 1, "Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess.": 1, "Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation.": 1, "Since I was born. My parents were members of the pack, back when Majni's father was Alpha.": 1, "Simple... he paid well. Very well.": 1, "Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.": 1, "Slay any vampires lately have we?": 1, "Slay it! Slay the dragon!": 1, "So if you don't have any business. Leave.": 1, "So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.": 1, "So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie.": 1, "So how has it come to pass that a vampire of mixed blood is in the company of my daughter?": 1, "So how has it come to pass that a vampire hunter is in the company of my daughter?": 1, "So how are things with you and Bolli?": 1, "So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day.": 1, "So he might still be in there?": 1, "So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?": 1, "So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?": 1, "So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?": 1, "So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.": 1, "So good to see you again. How can I be of service?": 1, "So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?": 1, "So if you're getting any ideas about selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.": 1, "So go dig at the other corner for a bit.": 1, "So glad we kept you in Skyrim. Serving your Emperor was worth the wait, of course.": 1, "So getting the guards to throw me in here as a \"punishment\" was about as easy as falling off a log.": 1, "So gaining the favor of a Telvanni wizard isn't enough?": 1, "So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council.": 1, "So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do.": 1, "So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity.": 1, "So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds.": 1, "So far, so good.": 1, "So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be.": 1, "So far this hasn't been too bad. Gets lonely exploring by myself, though.": 1, "So far so good.": 1, "So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though.": 1, "So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.": 1, "So enters Maven Black-Briar, the glint of Imperial coin in her eyes. So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?": 1, "So go and meet your beloved Stendarr.": 1, "So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good.": 1, "So is it true, bandits get... you know, real friendly with the wildlife?": 1, "So it begins.": 1, "So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.": 1, "So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!": 1, "So nice to have pleasant company for a change.": 1, "So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.": 1, "So my daughter applied some of the lessons I taught her about necromancy, did she?": 1, "So my brother really did it. Whiterun will be the toast of Skyrim for this!": 1, "So much.": 1, "So much wasted breath in that crew.": 1, "So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned.": 1, "So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?  ": 1, "So much energy... So much power. Never in my life have I seen something like this...": 1, "So maybe you could ask Isran if he knows anything? Just keep in mind that he... well, he might not like the idea.": 1, "So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons. Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!": 1, "So many things lost....": 1, "So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.": 1, "So many contracts, so little time...": 1, "So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks.": 1, "So it is. You have proven yourself an ally to the Skaal, and so the Skaal shall be allies to you.": 1, "So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.": 1, "So it was for my father, and his father before him. And I welcome any who walk that path.": 1, "So it wasn't my imagination.": 1, "So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear.": 1, "So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new.": 1, "So ends the story of Olaf the liar, a thief and a scoundrel we of Solitude commit to the fire.": 1, "So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.": 1, "So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that.": 1, "So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.": 1, "So let me take the lead in there.": 1, "So let's hear it.": 1, "So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power.": 1, "So long as you can back up those words with steel.": 1, "So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?": 1, "Not the most solid construction here. About what I'd expect from... creatures like this.": 1, "So ends the lesson.": 1, "So easily you betray me, after all these years.": 1, "So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.": 1, "So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.": 1, "So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that.": 1, "So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well.": 1, "So I found something. Here. Take it. I think you'll like it.": 1, "So I am. I guess we could use my blood. Do you have any arrows? Elven arrows. I'm not going to just bleed on any old thing.": 1, "So Geldis's plan worked, eh? Everytime we tried it, no one would ever show up.": 1, "So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?": 1, "So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see.": 1, "So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.": 1, "Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty. ": 1, "Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?": 1, "Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later.": 1, "Sneaking is overrated, eh?": 1, "So I hear. Come here, you.": 1, "Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.": 1, "Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can.": 1, "Smell that? Blood.": 1, "Smart.": 1, "Smart woman. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.": 1, "Smart man. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.": 1, "Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming.": 1, "Slow, but looking good, sir.": 1, "Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.": 1, "Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.": 1, "Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs.": 1, "Slen Tiid Vo!": 1, "Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?": 1, "Sleep.": 1, "Sleep well?": 1, "Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.": 1, "So I just need to take hold of it...": 1, "So I like to have a little fun, so what?": 1, "So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?": 1, "So don't concern yourself with it. Markarth is safe. You have my word.": 1, "So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn.": 1, "So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer.": 1, "So congratulations! You're free to go!": 1, "So cold, so hungry, so tired.": 1, "So close...": 1, "So close. Your prize is waiting.": 1, "So can I come?": 1, "So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.": 1, "So be it. I'm sure Arkay will find it in his heart to forgive you... eventually.": 1, "So be it!": 1, "So are you here as a client? Shall I remake your face?": 1, "So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.": 1, "So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?": 1, "So Neloth is afraid to face me himself!": 1, "So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?": 1, "So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.": 1, "So I need someone to find that proof for me.": 1, "So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though...": 1, "So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?": 1, "So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!": 1, "So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.": 1, "So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?": 1, "So either I need to find the satchel those mudcrabs stole, or I need another gyro from someplace. You wouldn't happen to have one, would you?": 1, "So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.": 1, "So I'll cut right to the chase.": 1, "So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it.": 1, "So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.": 1, "So I'm thinking that wasn't the right way.": 1, "So I'm, uh... writing a song for you...": 1, "So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back.": 1, "So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?": 1, "That tablet is your priority now. Bring that back from Bleak Falls Barrow and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.": 1, "Not that there's much beyond the confines of our town anyway.": 1, "Not that it matters anymore. No one bothers coming to Winterhold for any other reason. ": 1, "Jarl Hrongar...": 1, "Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.": 1, "Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have.": 1, "Jarl Black-Briar. I must admit, I do like the sound of that.": 1, "Jarl Black-Briar put your government together. Do it now, or there will be rioting in the streets.": 1, "Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now.": 1, "Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times.": 1, "Jarl Balgruuf...": 1, "Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way.": 1, "Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.": 1, "J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.": 1, "J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be.": 1, "J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?": 1, "J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.": 1, "Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.": 1, "J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.": 1, "J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.": 1, "J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?": 1, "J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...": 1, "J'zargo is pleased, and more than a little jealous, to greet the new Arch-Mage.": 1, "J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.": 1, "J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.": 1, "J'zargo hoped there might be one who could keep pace with his accomplishments.": 1, "J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage.": 1, "J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.": 1, "J'zargo has heard of the Staff of Magnus. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo to... Borrow it?": 1, "J'zargo had expected to be named Arch-Mage. But there is still time.": 1, "J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work.": 1, "J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.": 1, "J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?": 1, "J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.": 1, "J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top.": 1, "Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.": 1, "Jarl Skald is upset over the loss of Dawnstar. I'll admit, it's less I have to worry about.": 1, "Jump! Come on!": 1, "Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you.": 1, "Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing.": 1, "Judging from these writings, General Carius was under the impression that the fort was still active as it was 200 years ago.": 1, "Jouane?": 1, "Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing.": 1, "Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps.": 1, "Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.": 1, "Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.": 1, "Joor mey! What are you doing back there?": 1, "Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?": 1, "Jolly good guess!": 1, "Join you? You mean leave the village to journey with you and fight at your side?": 1, "Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)": 1, "Jarl Maven Black-Briar. Has a pleasant sound to it, wouldn't you say?": 1, "Join the forces mustering at the [CAPITAL] (infos conditions on location go here)": 1, "Join the Last Dragonborn in her destruction.": 1, "Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.": 1, "Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said.": 1, "Jewelry with legendary Argonian craftsmanship!": 1, "Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.": 1, "Jeron was furious to be left guarding the door.": 1, "Jawanan, I don't see you here often.": 1, "Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook.": 1, "Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary.": 1, "Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.": 1, "Jarl gets booted from Dawnstar, and I'm still stuck cleaning up the dirt.": 1, "Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.": 1, "Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.": 1, "Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?": 1, "Join the Last Dragonborn in his destruction.": 1, "J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.": 1, "I\u2026 I don't know, it wasn't me. I swear!": 1, "Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.": 1, "It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow.": 1, "It's very important you do this correctly.": 1, "It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.": 1, "It's up to her, isn't it?": 1, "It's unfortunate that we live in such violent times, but there you have it.": 1, "It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.": 1, "It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.": 1, "It's true.": 1, "It's true, the scrolls are a subject of interest to us, and work has been done to learn of them. But outsiders are not allowed within the College.": 1, "It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns.": 1, "It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!": 1, "It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.": 1, "It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.": 1, "It's true we Skaal prefer a simpler life than some, but we do still enjoy a luxury from time to time.": 1, "It's very unfortunate that you've been suspended.": 1, "It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that.": 1, "It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years.": 1, "It's true that I normally prefer to stay home and conduct my research in peace. Everything's so much more convenient there.": 1, "It's true for most of my brothers in the order as well. We don't really know where the scrolls came from or who wrote them.": 1, "It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.": 1, "It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.": 1, "It's tradition that the son of the smith take his father's place, but you have no son. Who will become smith of the Skaal after you?": 1, "It's tough, with just the two of us.": 1, "It's tough, just scraping by out here. But I make do.": 1, "It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out.": 1, "It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to go back in after.": 1, "It's too late for that. Leave me. Save yourself.": 1, "It's too late for regrets, Dragonborn.": 1, "It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.": 1, "It's too dangerous out here. We can't waste time worrying about having a liar in our midst. Lying is the first step to cowardice, after all.": 1, "It's true that my heart has always been restless, and fighting was the only way I could find peace.": 1, "It's wearing a dangerous spell...": 1, "It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are.": 1, "It's what some call the domain of Molag Bal. His place in Oblivion.": 1, "Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!": 1, "Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful.": 1, "Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach.": 1, "Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten.": 1, "Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again.": 1, "Its craftsmanship has no equal anywhere within Tamriel and possibly beyond.": 1, "Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.": 1, "Items? What items? Let me see those.": 1, "It... it was you? You created that prophecy?": 1, "It... almost doesn't even look real. You know?": 1, "It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now.": 1, "It's... well, it's about me. And the Elder Scroll that was buried with me.": 1, "It's... nothing...": 1, "It's... not as shiny as I was expecting.": 1, "It's... it's what Brenuin said I should do. He's the only one that's been nice to me since... since mama...": 1, "It's... it's true. It's all true! Come on, let's check it out!": 1, "It's... it's the least I can do. Just... keep this quiet.": 1, "It's where men have tested their mettle for ages.": 1, "It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.": 1, "It's where you go if you can't afford a room anywhere else. About the time they opened the mines, someone got the idea to throw beds in here.": 1, "It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest.": 1, "It's working, I'm flying! I'm really flying! Hahahaha!": 1, "It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!": 1, "Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born.": 1, "It's your choice whether to attempt to deal with them or force your way through.": 1, "It's your funeral.": 1, "It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.": 1, "It's... complicated. I can't really talk about it. I'm sorry.": 1, "It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.": 1, "It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.": 1, "It's... it's not easy. But I don't think we have much of a choice.": 1, "It's your choice, \"father\". Anytime you want to end it, you just give the word.": 1, "It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear.": 1, "Just a brother. Lives in Riften.": 1, "Just a little one! I was hungry!": 1, "Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others. ": 1, "Just one more mug of mead, and then I'm off!": 1, "Just one gyro. One, and I can get back to work. Where are they?": 1, "Just one gold? Please?": 1, "Just one bottle per customer. Except for the man who saved the festival. Here's a couple bottles for you.": 1, "Just not by you.": 1, "Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.": 1, "Just never you mind about that.": 1, "Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed.": 1, "Just name it.": 1, "Just make sure that you find solid evidence. If I accuse them without it, I'll be the laughingstock of the colony.": 1, "Just make sure that when the berries ripen, you make more pies than you did last time.": 1, "Just make sure not to tell anyone what you saw here.": 1, "Just looking at you makes me upset.": 1, "Just one right now, actually. ": 1, "Just look!": 1, "Just like old times, huh Horik? You and me fighting in a war over some forsaken scrap of land.": 1, "Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me.": 1, "Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives.": 1, "Just let me study these runes for a moment...": 1, "Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!": 1, "Just let me know when you're ready.": 1, "Just let me go, woman!": 1, "Just let me get back inside first.": 1, "Just leave me be.": 1, "Just leave me alone for a bit.": 1, "Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long.": 1, "Just know that... whatever path you choose, I won't think any less of you. Sometimes things just have to be done.": 1, "Just kill him and let's be done with it already.": 1, "Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.": 1, "Just look around, will you?": 1, "Just keep swinging!": 1, "Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni.": 1, "Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside.": 1, "Just the shadows playing tricks.": 1, "Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research.": 1, "Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.": 1, "Just tell him I lost it or something.": 1, "Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.": 1, "Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.": 1, "Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!": 1, "Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.": 1, "Just stay out of my way.": 1, "Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.": 1, "Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.": 1, "Just stay away from her, or...or else.": 1, "Just shut up and play the game.": 1, "Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.": 1, "Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all.": 1, "Just saying goodbye.": 1, "Just say the word, master.": 1, "Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.": 1, "Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.": 1, "Just remember, we take care of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life.": 1, "Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says.": 1, "Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws.": 1, "Just remember who's in charge around here.": 1, "Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family.": 1, "Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.": 1, "Just remember I'm here if you rethink your decision.": 1, "Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.": 1, "Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them.": 1, "Just point me to the fight.": 1, "Just play along.": 1, "Just say the word, mistress.": 1, "Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.": 1, "Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.": 1, "Just keep moving, you'll wear him out!": 1, "Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.": 1, "Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.": 1, "Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done.": 1, "Just come back alive, and I'll be happy.": 1, "Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.": 1, "Just close the door, will you?": 1, "Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.": 1, "Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few septims.": 1, "Just bring it back to me.": 1, "Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!": 1, "Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good.": 1, "Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster.": 1, "Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.": 1, "Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.": 1, "Just finish the job. If you aren't back in a couple of hours, I'll start packing up.": 1, "Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best.": 1, "Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise.": 1, "Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves.": 1, "Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home.": 1, "Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.": 1, "Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours.": 1, "Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?": 1, "Just another minute, please.": 1, "Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them.": 1, "Just a... scratch!": 1, "Just a taste...": 1, "Just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.": 1, "Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed.": 1, "Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind.": 1, "Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it.": 1, "Just be sure to bring an ancient Nord pickaxe with you. It's the only pickaxe that can mine the Stalhrim properly without breaking it.": 1, "Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener.": 1, "Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates.": 1, "Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it.": 1, "Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you.": 1, "Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company.": 1, "Just in time, too. Kuvar was starting to give me some grief about his new armor. This will do the trick nicely.": 1, "Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.": 1, "Just hit them, and they'll... do whatever it is they're supposed to do.": 1, "Just here to work.": 1, "Just here to drink.": 1, "Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.": 1, "Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.": 1, "Just head north - you can't miss it.": 1, "Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.": 1, "Just guide them well, and all will work out.": 1, "Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim. ": 1, "Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you.": 1, "Just go away, please.": 1, "Just glad all that business with Malyn is over with. What did you need?": 1, "Just give up! You can't win!": 1, "Just get all of the ingredients into the vessel.": 1, "Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.": 1, "Just get out of here.": 1, "Just get out of my way, I've got work to do.": 1, "Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.": 1, "Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it.": 1, "Just a few.": 1, "Just get them to taste my sujamma... once they take a sip, it'll sell itself.": 1, "Just give me a minute. Let me think.": 1, "Just give me a minute... I'm out of breath...": 1, "Just give me a moment.": 1, "Just give the General some time!": 1, "Just give them to me and put it on my account.": 1, "Just give up!": 1, "Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.": 1, "Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.": 1, "It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.": 1, "It's to be a real fight, then. Good!": 1, "It's much safer for me to risk your life.": 1, "It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.": 1, "It's magnificent, isn't it?": 1, "It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says \"sand elske.\"": 1, "It's locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once we get out.": 1, "It's locked for a reason.": 1, "It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to.": 1, "It's like the world is alive again. Just like me.": 1, "It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.": 1, "It's like it was in my dreams.": 1, "It's like from the stories I used to hear... the two adventurers seeing the world.": 1, "It's like being born. Every time.": 1, "It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies.": 1, "It's just... it's not for me.": 1, "It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night.": 1, "It's just... aren't you worried about the Forsworn? Maybe it's not safe here.": 1, "It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.": 1, "It's just... ": 1, "It's just this way. Keep following me.": 1, "It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.": 1, "It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with him?": 1, "It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with her?": 1, "It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand.": 1, "It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.": 1, "It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?": 1, "It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old. ": 1, "It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.": 1, "It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it.": 1, "It's just business.": 1, "It's just ahead. Please, keep following.": 1, "It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would...": 1, "It's just across the bridge and up that hill.": 1, "It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend.": 1, "It's my fault. In my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the careful preparation required.": 1, "It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you.": 1, "It's not confusing... just frustrating.": 1, "It's not as good as it used to be, but I still am, at least.": 1, "It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for.": 1, "It's not an insult, just an observation.": 1, "It's not about you! You've been so great in getting me back here.": 1, "It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free.": 1, "It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.": 1, "It's not a question of trust... he's just obsessed with the prophecy. ": 1, "It's not a fate I would wish on anyone. And not what I wanted for my brother.": 1, "It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.": 1, "It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.": 1, "It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!": 1, "It's no secret to me that Frea hesitates. Her path is not clear.": 1, "It's my family home. Not the most welcoming place, but depending on who's around, I'll be safe there.": 1, "It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.": 1, "It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...": 1, "It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by.": 1, "It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring.": 1, "It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.": 1, "It's no Warmaiden's, but I've got a decent supply.": 1, "It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?": 1, "It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?": 1, "It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.": 1, "It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling.": 1, "It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower.": 1, "It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know.": 1, "It's my own formula for improved bonemold. Took me years to perfect.": 1, "It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes.": 1, "It's my hope that you will, yes.": 1, "It's no fun unless you fight me with magic.": 1, "It's just a dream, child. Nothing more.": 1, "It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here.": 1, "It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains...": 1, "It's good that you brought this to my attention.": 1, "It's good that our people are now free. We can attempt to restore balance to our home.": 1, "It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.": 1, "It's good practice. Most people barely notice what I'm playing.": 1, "It's gone now.": 1, "It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all.": 1, "It's going to take more than that to change my mind.": 1, "It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.": 1, "It's going to take forever to sift through all this.": 1, "It's going to take a lot more than that.": 1, "It's going to hit three thousand this time, I'm afraid. Have you got that on you?": 1, "It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see.": 1, "It's going to be a long time before things ever get back to the way they were... if ever.": 1, "It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.": 1, "It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.": 1, "It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up.": 1, "It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship.": 1, "It's frightening living below their monastery.": 1, "It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!": 1, "It's fine. Much better than the rickety tools I had in the Legion.": 1, "It's fine, it can just be kind of a sore subject. ": 1, "It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place.": 1, "It's fashioned from actual bone that's been reinforced with a resin-like material and then shaped to form the armored plating.": 1, "It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.": 1, "It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again.": 1, "It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage.": 1, "It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house.": 1, "It's easy to criticize when you're just a visitor here.": 1, "It's easy - stay inside the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.": 1, "It's down the stairs, dear. Just come right in.": 1, "It's from... Falk Firebeard at the Blue Palace? You've got friends in high places.": 1, "It's good to be mining again.": 1, "It's good to get the old nose working again. I missed sniffing out the ebony deposits and getting my hands dirty.": 1, "It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.": 1, "It's in the clouds!": 1, "It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.": 1, "It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?": 1, "It's important, so please just listen before your friend, here, loses his patience.": 1, "It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that. ": 1, "It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know.": 1, "It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.": 1, "It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it.": 1, "It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it.": 1, "It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it.": 1, "It's hard to explain... I remember those people with the masks coming on board, then...": 1, "It's hard to explain, but as much as I have come to think of Skaal Village as a second home, I do still miss Skyrim.": 1, "It's hard to describe. The Soul Cairn is... well, hungry, for lack of a better word. It's trying to take your life essence as payment.": 1, "It's great to see you again! It's been too quiet without you around.": 1, "It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.": 1, "It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?": 1, "It's got to be in here somewhere...": 1, "It's good to have trustworthy souls in this place.": 1, "It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.": 1, "It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?": 1, "It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.": 1, "It's good to see you again, Skaal-friend. By saving Baldor, you helped to preserve our sacred traditions.": 1, "It's good to see you again.": 1, "It's not easy to get supplies way out here, but I'm managing. Take a look.": 1, "It's good to see you in one piece, lad!": 1, "It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long.": 1, "It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always.": 1, "It's good to speak to you again.": 1, "It's good to spend some time on solid land.": 1, "It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.": 1, "It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.": 1, "It's good to see you in one piece, lass!": 1, "It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.": 1, "It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?": 1, "It's not exactly the hospitality I'm used to, but your man Isran has seen to my needs well enough.": 1, "It's the capital of Morrowind... been that way ever since Mournhold was sacked by the Argonians.": 1, "It's the Imperials! Take cover!": 1, "It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother.": 1, "It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.": 1, "It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.": 1, "It's starting to look like Esbern was right.": 1, "It's special to the Spriggans. They seem to like to gather there.": 1, "It's sort of a random assortment of things. See anything useful?": 1, "It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way.": 1, "It's something all right. ": 1, "It's so strange. I feel like it's from a dream. Something about the Earth Stone, and a shrine... That's it. That's all I can think of.": 1, "It's so nice to have a visitor.": 1, "It's so good to have everyone around the table again.": 1, "It's so bright out here. I don't know how you stand it.": 1, "It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it.": 1, "It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years.": 1, "It's ruled by unseen beings known as the Ideal Masters.": 1, "It's rough out here. But I'm getting by.": 1, "It's rotten because the wood is cheap and its soaked with ale! Now we'll have to replace all the furniture before bugs set in.": 1, "It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.": 1, "It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.": 1, "It's really too bad, you know. The little accident you had here, completely unexpected...": 1, "It's really great we're friends. I was hoping to find some way to thank you. I hope this does the trick.": 1, "It's quite simple really. There are some who shall not be dignified by being named, who have implied that it is not.": 1, "It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures.": 1, "It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.": 1, "It's quiet for the moment.": 1, "It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding.": 1, "It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.": 1, "It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own.": 1, "It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.": 1, "It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself.": 1, "It's the escaped prisoners!": 1, "It's the least I can do for your help in putting this matter to rest.": 1, "It's time you learned a lesson.": 1, "It's time we take the fight to their door.": 1, "It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.": 1, "It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?": 1, "It's time to take the fight to them, and finish this.": 1, "It's time to leave.": 1, "It's time to end this.": 1, "It's time to decide.": 1, "It's time for you to suffer!": 1, "It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery.": 1, "It's through this ancestral chorus that the moths tap into a form of primal augur and become a conduit for deciphering the scrolls.": 1, "It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.": 1, "It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?": 1, "It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.": 1, "It's the homeland of the dunmer. The lesser races call us dark elves.": 1, "It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.": 1, "It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right.": 1, "It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder.": 1, "It's the root that looks like an ugly little man.": 1, "It's the reason for the Soul Cairn's existence, and the only leverage a necromancer has when bargaining with them.": 1, "It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!": 1, "It's the price we pay for openly recruiting. We'll have to step up our defenses.": 1, "It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.": 1, "It's the only way they'll discover that they weren't always malignant... they were once a proud and prosperous race.": 1, "It's the only tool tough enough to crack stalhrim, is what it is.": 1, "It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out.": 1, "It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. ": 1, "It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out.": 1, "It's the leaving that's hardest, I know.": 1, "It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway.": 1, "It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.": 1, "It's probably best if you put that weapon away.": 1, "It's probably best for you if we're not seen together right now.": 1, "It's not working! Try something else!": 1, "It's not wise to discuss it here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story.": 1, "It's not true, I assure you.": 1, "It's not too far, now. At least, I don't think it is. I thought you knew the way?": 1, "It's not too bad here. But... I still miss my parents.": 1, "It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone.": 1, "It's not the most exciting answer but the most likely. I'll write it in.": 1, "It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people. ": 1, "It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls outsiders.": 1, "It's not that simple. I guess it never is with families, is it?": 1, "It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city.": 1, "It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.": 1, "It's not so simple as just killing them, though.": 1, "It's not safe out there. Horrible creatures attacking towns in the night... If they won't let me in, at least I can stay here.": 1, "It's not worth dying over.": 1, "It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.": 1, "It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?": 1, "It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it.": 1, "It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it.": 1, "It's not much, but we get by.": 1, "It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing.": 1, "It's not looking good, is it?": 1, "It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.": 1, "It's not like anything else in Skyrim, I can tell you that much. From now or... before.": 1, "It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously.": 1, "It's not just the bow, Deor. Your arm has grown strong and your eye sharp. You've spent many days practicing your aim.": 1, "It's not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat and Restoration magics can keep them at bay.": 1, "It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!": 1, "It's not from your father. It's from Captain Veleth.": 1, "It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all.": 1, "It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me.": 1, "It's not you I'm worried about.": 1, "It's not your fault, Drovas. You do other things well.": 1, "It's not your fault. There were too many of them. Nobody could have known...": 1, "It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions.": 1, "It's pretty simple. Hrothmund's axe is in there with him. Anyone who attempts to take hold of it has their spirit judged by Hrothmund himself.": 1, "It's possible that your killing blow has merely displaced Durnehviir's physical form while he reconstitutes himself.": 1, "It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.": 1, "It's pointless and vague, like all prophecies. The part he latched onto said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun.": 1, "It's over. He's dead, and the prophecy dies with him.": 1, "It's over.": 1, "It's our time now.": 1, "It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.": 1, "It's our honor to have you there. ": 1, "It's only right seein' as your the important lumber man.": 1, "It's only for Serana's sake that I have let you live.": 1, "It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.": 1, "It's only a matter of time!": 1, "It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.": 1, "It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.": 1, "It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...": 1, "It's not!": 1, "It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it.": 1, "It's nothing that can't be fixed.": 1, "It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?": 1, "It's nothing.": 1, "It's nothing. Carry on.": 1, "It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that.": 1, "It's okay, I know what happened at home. With the dragon and all.": 1, "It's okay, mother. I understand.": 1, "It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt.": 1, "It's on an island near Solitude. Hopefully we can find a boat to take us there.": 1, "It's on your head if something goes wrong.": 1, "It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.": 1, "It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime.": 1, "It's okay, dear.

Now she's after Mercer.": 1, "Kalaree?": 1, "Last I'd heard of him, he was aiding the Vigilants of Stendarr at Ruunvald. He may still be there.": 1, "Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead.": 1, "Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing.": 1, "La la la, do do do do do, dum de dum dum... ": 1, "Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.": 1, "Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.": 1, "Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet there, your choice.": 1, "Kyne's guardian troll awaits you. Complete this trial and you'll have proven yourself a true hunter.": 1, "Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm.": 1, "Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.": 1, "Kynareth save us, here he comes again...": 1, "Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.": 1, "Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear.": 1, "Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it.": 1, "Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.": 1, "Kuvar. He thinks we've all gotten a little too soft. I can see what he means looking at Elmus, but the rest of us still have our edge. ": 1, "Kuvar, listen to me. You said yourself that this place had lost sight of its past. We need a new tradition, to move us forward.": 1, "La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la. La la la, la la la la la laaaaaahhhh...": 1, "Kuvar, I...": 1, "Kuvar isn't enough to frighten me off. He makes a lot of noise, but at the end of the day, he wants what we all want.": 1, "Kuuuuuuuuuwaaaaa!": 1, "Kuuh!": 1, "Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest.": 1, "Kruziikrel, ziil los dii du!": 1, "Kruziikrel! Relonikiv! Now!": 1, "Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me.": 1, "Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here.": 1, "Krin mey. You are a fool to challenge Miraak. His thu'um is supreme.": 1, "Krif krin. Pruzah!": 1, "Kren sosaal!": 1, "Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau gol, as promised.": 1, "Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.": 1, "Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.": 1, "Kuvar, I'm your wife. You can't...": 1, "Korvanjund. Remember?": 1, "Laborers. The sick. The lame. We're all here.": 1, "Lad, I know what you've been up to.": 1, "Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet.": 1, "Last I knew, he was headed to Ruunvald. But then, we hadn't heard from anyone there in a few weeks.": 1, "Last I knew he was out scouring Skyrim for more beasts to tame.": 1, "Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.": 1, "Lass, I know what you've been up to.": 1, "Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day.": 1, "Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.": 1, "Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.": 1, "Land on the ground, and I will have more to teach you.": 1, "Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere.": 1, "Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.": 1, "Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended.": 1, "Laelette? I thought she left to join the Stormcloaks. Ah! My poor Laelette!": 1, "Laelette! She's dead!": 1, "Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place.": 1, "Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to.": 1, "Lady, could you spare a coin?": 1, "Lady Serana's back! Open the gate!": 1, "Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.": 1, "Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry.": 1, "Lady Maven, how may I help you?": 1, "Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.": 1, "Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.": 1, "Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?": 1, "Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.": 1, "Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready.": 1, "Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides.": 1, "Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.": 1, "Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.": 1, "Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!": 1, "Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up.": 1, "Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him.": 1, "Koor...": 1, "Kooova mook.": 1, "Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.": 1, "Killing him was a bit... impulsive.": 1, "Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it.": 1, "Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?": 1, "Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common.": 1, "Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But... distracted. Weakened.": 1, "Kill well, and often.": 1, "Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now.": 1, "Kill them all. Protect the Jarl at all costs!": 1, "Kill their leaders. That should put a stop to a full out war.": 1, "Kill their leader before it has a chance to escape!": 1, "Kill the vampire!": 1, "Kill the dragon, quickly!": 1, "Kill the damn dragon! Unless you have a better idea?!": 1, "Killing their leaders should discourage them from an out and out war with us.": 1, "Kill the beast!": 1, "Kill that beast!": 1, "Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities.": 1, "Kill me or don't, Listener! The power is yours! But spare poor Cicero, and a friend you will have! Oh, such a friend, until we enter the Void...": 1, "Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.": 1, "Kill me already!": 1, "Kill him. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.": 1, "Kill him.": 1, "Kill him now, while we still can!": 1, "Kill her. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.": 1, "Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.": 1, "Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!": 1, "Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.": 1, "Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove.": 1, "Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.": 1, "Kill the abominations!": 1, "Kind of fitting that the Vigilants would be wiped out by vampires.": 1, "Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it.": 1, "Kind of sad, really.": 1, "Koolawasa!": 1, "Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?": 1, "Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone.": 1, "Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.": 1, "Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.": 1, "Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin.": 1, "Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders.": 1, "Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it.": 1, "Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key.": 1, "Knowledge for knowledge.": 1, "Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?": 1, "Knowing that Serana shares that blessing with me, I'm already terrified that Harkon will get his hands on her.": 1, "Knowing him, anything at all that reminded him of her was just destroyed.": 1, "Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself. ": 1, "Know your place, mortal. Or Molag Bal may just send another champion to claim his mace from your broken corpse.": 1, "Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.": 1, "Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!": 1, "Kind of scary if I think about it.": 1, "Kind of soothing, actually. I feel a little warmer, now.": 1, "King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear.": 1, "King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?": 1, "Kjeld bothering you again?": 1, "Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.": 1, "Kel drey ni viik.": 1, "Kleppr, you idiot! Can't you do anything right?": 1, "Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.": 1, "Klimmek? What is it?": 1, "Knife. Yes. Book. Yes. Bucket. Yes. Inkpot? No.": 1, "Know about them? Lad, you're looking at them.": 1, "Know about them? Lass, you're looking at them.": 1, "Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.": 1, "Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.": 1, "Life here has many advantages, don't you agree?": 1, "It's done, then. We've been chasing that fiend for a long time.": 1, "It's disrespectful and dangerous to walk around here mortal. What were you thinking?": 1, "Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.": 1, "Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly.": 1, "Inside the house. Now.": 1, "Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though.": 1, "Inn's closed. Bar's still open, though.": 1, "Inkpot. Stone. Bucket. Book. Knife.": 1, "Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards.": 1, "Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!": 1, "Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get.": 1, "Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?": 1, "Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!": 1, "Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.": 1, "Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.": 1, "Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.": 1, "Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night.": 1, "Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.": 1, "Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.": 1, "Indeed. The day hasn't been won while Harkon still walks Tamriel.": 1, "Indeed. That would be best.": 1, "Indeed. She's off to Redwater Den.": 1, "Indeed. One should find his death while he can still call himself a proper man.": 1, "Indeed. It is no small thing to submit yourself to the flesh sculptor's knife.": 1, "Indeed. If we ever get there.": 1, "Indeed. I knew that the Dragon Priests were thought to have been powerful men of great will, but I had no idea.": 1, "Indeed. He's off to Redwater Den.": 1, "Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse. ": 1, "Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...": 1, "Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer. ": 1, "Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why.": 1, "Indeed.  Alduin wahlaan daanii.": 1, "Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.": 1, "Indeed, you saw more clearly than I - certainly more clearly than Alduin. Rok funta koraav.": 1, "Insolent bard. Die!": 1, "Instead of listening to a ghost in a tomb, we should steer our own destinies.": 1, "Is he working for my father?": 1, "Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?": 1, "Is he dead?": 1, "Is everything well, Nelacar?": 1, "Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?": 1, "Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.": 1, "Is dinner ready?": 1, "Is anyone out there? Anyone?": 1, "Is any man ever ready to give the order that will mean the deaths of many.": 1, "Is a single coin too much to ask for?": 1, "Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?": 1, "Is Ulfric's armor done yet?": 1, "Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.": 1, "Ironically, our undoing came at the hands of our own people.": 1, "Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment.": 1, "Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.": 1, "Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.": 1, "Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...": 1, "Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.": 1, "Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once.": 1, "Invaders have breached the fort! Attack!": 1, "Interesting. This may be worth exploring.": 1, "Interesting. That would suggest that the city must have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain.": 1, "Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.": 1, "Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.": 1, "Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on.": 1, "Interesting that these statues are different. If they represent archery, magic and swordsmanship, then what does that tell us?": 1, "Instead, he stayed on Solstheim and spent most of his life prospecting for a new ebony source. Sadly, it never surfaced.": 1, "Instead you hid your shame.": 1, "Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of...": 1, "Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig.": 1, "Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided.": 1, "Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side.": 1, "Indeed! One moment I was writing diligently, and the next, my door bursts open.": 1, "In the mean time, we would keep a bed and chest here for you.": 1, "In the mean time, take this for helping me.": 1, "In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch.": 1, "In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge.": 1, "In the end, she was one of the better leaders we've had, but if she didn't deserve it anymore, I guess that's that.": 1, "In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality...": 1, "In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.": 1, "In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to assemble a complete automaton in a single day.": 1, "In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it.": 1, "In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize his claim.": 1, "In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.": 1, "In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess.": 1, "In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose.": 1, "In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night.": 1, "In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending. ": 1, "In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name.": 1, "In some parts of the world, wielding a weapon openly like that is an invitation to combat...": 1, "In reward, he gave everlasting life to myself, my wife and my daughter. And so I have defeated mortality itself.": 1, "In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises.": 1, "In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.": 1, "In return, I was to serve them as a Keeper until the death of the one who calls herself Valerica.": 1, "In return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak.": 1, "In order to write the second volume of my opus, I need the notes from my first volume. Otherwise I need to do all of this from memory.": 1, "In order to subdue this chaotic world, to set things right, I must return to this realm in full.": 1, "In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself.": 1, "In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften.": 1, "In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do.": 1, "In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named \"The Brawny Prawn.\" But the years have a way of creeping up on you.": 1, "In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent.": 1, "In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has bested a fellow dovah in battle.": 1, "In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos.": 1, "In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong.": 1, "In the meantime, don't make me regret my sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your friend here is going to pay for it.": 1, "In the meantime, if there are any potions you might need, feel free to help yourself.": 1, "Indeed I was. I hunted down and killed every last one of them. Took years.": 1, "Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them.": 1, "Indeed I do.": 1, "Indeed I did! For a few septims, I'll tell you about some of the most interesting curiosities in my collection.": 1, "Incredible. Simply incredible.": 1, "Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!": 1, "Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.": 1, "Incorrect. You can worship whatever gods you like. But Talos is a man, and only a heretic would think otherwise... ": 1, "Incipient madness. Loss of self-awareness. Black spots in the whites of the eyes.": 1, "In your tongue, the Word simply means \"Fire.\" It is change given form. Power at its most primal.": 1, "In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise.": 1, "In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.": 1, "In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here.": 1, "In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right hand.": 1, "In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!": 1, "In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.": 1, "In these parts? Good luck. But don't come this way again.": 1, "In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword. ": 1, "In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for you.": 1, "In the meantime, why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke. ": 1, "In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious.": 1, "In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.": 1, "In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!": 1, "Is he... like me?": 1, "In the old days, the Dawnguard kept all of Skyrim safe from those bloodsucking scum.": 1, "In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies.": 1, "In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view.": 1, "In the unlikely event that I ever require you for some reason, I shall find you. Until then I see no reason for us to be speaking.": 1, "In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin.": 1, "In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin.": 1, "In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.": 1, "In the old stories, when the Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up.": 1, "In my heart, I know that it was my wife, Valerica, who took my beloved daughter away from me.": 1, "Is he... sifting through trash?": 1, "Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?": 1, "Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.": 1, "Is this somehow connected to your search for Miraak?": 1, "Is this no longer so?": 1, "Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business.": 1, "Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business.": 1, "Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!": 1, "Is this a dwarven city? I can't believe they'd let it get so run down.": 1, "Is this a dream? No, it is a nightmare, surely.": 1, "Is there... something I can do for you?": 1, "Is there somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will reach the Imperials...": 1, "Is there something you need, dear?": 1, "Is there something I do for you?": 1, "Is there something I can help you with?": 1, "Is there someone out there?": 1, "Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.": 1, "Is there some way I can assist you?": 1, "Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?": 1, "Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?": 1, "Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...": 1, "Is there anything else? Could be your last chance.": 1, "Is there any news from High Rock?": 1, "Is there a reason you're asking me?": 1, "Is the new shaft cleared yet?": 1, "Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't be shy. Plenty of room for everyone.": 1, "Is the food and drink to your liking?": 1, "Is that... the best... you can do... ": 1, "Is that... the Forge?": 1, "Is that... oh no. Are we going down there?": 1, "Is that your best, mortal?": 1, "Is that you?": 1, "Is there some problem?": 1, "Is that wise, sir?": 1, "Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?": 1, "Is this... some kind of a joke? Did Arkay put you up to this?": 1, "It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.": 1, "It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate.": 1, "It all comes back to my father.": 1, "It ain't so bad. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here.": 1, "It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that.": 1, "It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.": 1, "Isran? Wants me?": 1, "Isran? Needing someone else's help? Never thought I'd hear that.": 1, "Isran? My help?": 1, "Isran, these vampires are different. I know you've disagreed with the Order in the past...": 1, "Isran, of all people. We're reduced to asking him for help.": 1, "Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of the Vigilants... everyone... they're all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?": 1, "Isran's inside the fort. He's the one you need to talk to.": 1, "Isran's done nothing but mock me. He's never given me the respect I deserve.": 1, "Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?": 1, "Isran will decide if you've got what it takes. Go on, he's right inside.": 1, "Isran is the only one trying to do something about these vampires.": 1, "Isran has a problem with most people, if you haven't yet noticed.": 1, "Isran had a surprising stockpile of weapons and armor. Take a look.": 1, "Isran found something for you to do, eh? I thought he'd like you. Good luck!": 1, "Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!": 1, "Isn't there some business you should be tending to?": 1, "Isn't that something. But I'm not heading down there, and there's no way anyone else will, until the draugr are gone. Keep at it.": 1, "Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....": 1, "Isn't it obvious? Why, the wonderful weather and hospitable people, of course!": 1, "Isn't it obvious? They're soft, the lot of them.": 1, "Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary.": 1, "Isn't it amazing?": 1, "Is... everything all right here?": 1, "Is your... pet keeping you entertained?": 1, "Isran was right all along. We should have listened to his warnings. It's too late for the Vigilants now.": 1, "Is that what you call it?

I just want to make money!": 1, "Imperial spies? You can't be serious!": 1, "Imperial bastard.": 1, "Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched.": 1, "Imedhnain, I was just comparing the ledgers from last season.": 1, "Imagine what I could do with that power.": 1, "Imagine the power of being able to command entire villages to do your bidding.": 1, "Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.": 1, "Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.": 1, "Illdi. What year did the Aldmeri Dominion invade the Empire?": 1, "Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity.": 1, "Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.": 1, "If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul.": 1, "If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss.": 1, "If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.": 1, "If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you.": 1, "If? I've been assuming that's where all this is going. ": 1, "Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not.": 1, "If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall.": 1, "Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.": 1, "Igmund, we need to talk about the Silver-Blood family.": 1, "Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in.": 1, "Ignoring me, huh? Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!": 1, "Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers.": 1, "Ildari? She was a beauty, she was.": 1, "Ildari? Then it's my own fault. She was my apprentice before Talvas.": 1, "Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.": 1, "It's done, then. Justice, if you can call it that.": 1, "It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?": 1, "It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power.": 1, "It wouldn't do to have you become better than me after all.": 1, "It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...": 1, "It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar.": 1, "It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time.": 1, "It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.": 1, "It would seem so. And you are to thank for it.": 1, "It would seem so.": 1, "It would seem our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.": 1, "It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it.": 1, "It would ruin me.": 1, "It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?": 1, "It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.": 1, "It would make you a bit weaker when we travel through the Soul Cairn, but we might be able to fix that once we're inside. Maybe.": 1, "It would have to be someone pretty desperate.": 1, "It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.": 1, "It would explain what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I thought I must have just been seeing things...": 1, "It would be madness to go through there.": 1, "It would be fair to say that House Redoran literally saved the Dunmer people from destruction.": 1, "It would be best if we spoke little until you've completed your task.": 1, "It worked... you did it...": 1, "It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it! ": 1, "It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one. ": 1, "It won't be that easy to get rid of the Rieklings, Kuvar.": 1, "It won't be easy. The whole lower part of the city is flooded, which has shut down the boilers which supply steam to the reading room.": 1, "It won't be a waste.": 1, "It will... take more than that... to stop me...": 1, "It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.": 1, "It will pass.": 1, "It will keep it's hands to itself, yes?": 1, "It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us.": 1, "It would be nice not to always be so thirsty.": 1, "It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it.": 1, "It'll be Skyrim that leads the charge. Mark my words. And that time around, mankind will either succeed once and for all or die trying.": 1, "It'll be good to get outside and breathe again. I haven't missed the sunlight, but I do miss fresh air.": 1, "It's a foregone conclusion, you know.": 1, "It's a fine day with you around.": 1, "It's a death pit, I tell you.": 1, "It's a deal.": 1, "It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements.": 1, "It's a bit worn, but I'll take it.": 1, "It's a bit dried up, but it will do. Here.": 1, "It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on.": 1, "It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.": 1, "It's Telvanni magic at its best. He brought the cuttings with him from Morrowind and used sorcery to grow them.": 1, "It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!": 1, "It's Ralis's problem now.": 1, "It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too... I'll make it worth your while.": 1, "It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.": 1, "It'll be good to get out of the sun for a while.": 1, "It's Joric. I fear his condition is worse.": 1, "It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?": 1, "It's Grelod!": 1, "It's Durnehviir... he's here! Defend yourselves!": 1, "It's Dunmer tradition for the ashes of the deceased to be placed in an ancestral tomb.": 1, "It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad.": 1, "It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind.": 1, "It'll take years, but I'll organize the Forsworn again. We'll reclaim our land, and then, when power is ours, we'll have peace. A kingdom.": 1, "It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work.": 1, "It'll make for a better song.": 1, "It'll do you good! Maybe you could visit Irgnir or Fruki on your way out? I've seen them looking at you when they come in for drinks....": 1, "It'll be there. You'll see.": 1, "It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.": 1, "It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain.": 1, "It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.": 1, "It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften.": 1, "It will be my pleasure.": 1, "It will be done, my lord!": 1, "It will be dangerous, but if you'll deal with these thieves, we would be most grateful.": 1, "It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.": 1, "It was nice to meet you.": 1, "It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.": 1, "It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks.": 1, "It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.": 1, "It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces.": 1, "It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do.": 1, "It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.": 1, "It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time.": 1, "It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.": 1, "It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it.": 1, "It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim.": 1, "It was like he was daring us to come and get him.": 1, "It was just before the draugr woke up.": 1, "It was no mere chance that brought you to me. It was destiny.": 1, "It was her time, father. None of us have any control over that. You mustn't blame yourself.": 1, "It was expected of her, just as it was expected of me.": 1, "It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.": 1, "It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.": 1, "It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders.": 1, "It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.": 1, "It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.": 1, "It was born out of the necessity to survive in the harsh climate of our homeland.": 1, "It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow.": 1, "It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one.": 1, "It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.": 1, "It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else.": 1, "It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.": 1, "It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty. ": 1, "It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!": 1, "It was good speaking with you again.": 1, "It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain.": 1, "It was only just a little bit ago. I bet you can catch them if you hurry up.": 1, "It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.": 1, "It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.": 1, "It wasn't so bad.": 1, "It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!": 1, "It wasn't long before we became homesick... we were the only Dunmer in Morthal.": 1, "It wasn't enough that the College still stands, now the damnable Empire has Winterhold. I hope they all freeze to death.": 1, "It wasn't easy getting all your things. A few guards had to have their throats slit.": 1, "It wasn't always like this. Best-preserved dwarven city I'd ever laid eyes on. And then... the earthquake hit.": 1, "It was. After refusing to allow anyone to bring him food, Councilor Morvayn ordered his door to be knocked down before Crescius starved to death.": 1, "It was.": 1, "It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me.": 1, "It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom. ": 1, "It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage. ": 1, "It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it. ": 1, "It was very sudden. It was almost like one day we were a normal family, and then the next I didn't know who they were.": 1, "It was very strange. Was I... building something? A shrine, down on the beach near the Earth Stone? I'm not sure.": 1, "It was very like the one you found in Miraak's temple. A thing of dark magic, not of the All-Maker.": 1, "It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.": 1, "It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow.": 1, "It was quite annoying when she died.": 1, "It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan... incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.": 1, "It was scary. It was like it was real!": 1, "It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time.": 1, "It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say.": 1, "It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.": 1, "It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war.": 1, "It was the Betrayed... they did something to him, I just don't know why Auri-El would allow this to happen.": 1, "It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!": 1, "It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!": 1, "It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?": 1, "It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us.": 1, "It was the Kel - the Elder Scroll. They used it to... cast him adrift on the currents of Time.": 1, "It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.": 1, "It was a simple task, so I didn't keep close tabs on it like I do with the dangerous stuff.": 1, "It's a good thing you've always lived here on Solstheim.": 1, "It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all.": 1, "It's been easier lately.": 1, "It's been difficult, but I'm not regretting it one bit. In fact, I'm glad we've been able to stay and help.": 1, "It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?": 1, "It's been better, I'll be honest with you.": 1, "It's been an honor.": 1, "It's been an honor, guardian.": 1, "It's been an honor to serve you, brother.": 1, "It's been a while, outlander. Looking to unleash some havoc across Tamriel again?": 1, "It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back.": 1, "It's been a pleasure.": 1, "It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let me open the gate and you can head into the city.": 1, "It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track.": 1, "It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.": 1, "It's been a long time since I walked the ashlands of Vvardenfell. I miss it terribly.": 1, "It's been forever since I've eaten so well.": 1, "It's been a long time since I felt that way and it's been long overdue. My thanks, to both of you.": 1, "It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!": 1, "It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.": 1, "It's bad enough my brother is harping on me to pick one. Don't you start too.": 1, "It's back to work, then.": 1, "It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.": 1, "It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.": 1, "It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.": 1, "It's as if Tel Mithryn is cursed. Spoiled food, ash spawn attacks, my servants constantly getting sick. What's next?": 1, "It's as bad as ever.": 1, "It's around the side of the castle. Let's move.": 1, "It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.": 1, "It's an old tree. Very old. They say it was a seedling when the first men were arriving from Atmora, thousands of years ago.": 1, "It's an old family. Very well-respected throughout the Reach.": 1, "It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in. ": 1, "It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say.": 1, "It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher.": 1, "It's been good talking to you.": 1, "It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.": 1, "It's difficult... Something about it doesn't feel right. A... A temple, here on the island. That's all I can recall.": 1, "It's difficult to have a conversation with you like that. Would you mind changing back?": 1, "It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic. ": 1, "It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm.": 1, "It's definitely been a bad thing, on the whole.": 1, "It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?": 1, "It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?": 1, "It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty.": 1, "It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.": 1, "It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.": 1, "It's come to my inescapable attention that you, my dear friend, are married.": 1, "It's colder down here. I don't like the cold.": 1, "It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay.": 1, "It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.": 1, "It's been many winters since my husband returned to the All-Maker, but my heart still aches from the loss.": 1, "It's clear that memories are far too short.": 1, "It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale.": 1, "It's called \"Nettlebane.\" The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself.": 1, "It's busier now that things are starting to look up. I guess I might stay a bit longer after all.": 1, "It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here.": 1, "It's better that way.": 1, "It's best you leave me be. ": 1, "It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.": 1, "It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him.": 1, "It's been two months, and no word from father.": 1, "It's been tough running the household alone, but Crescius isn't getting any younger.": 1, "It's been so much fun.": 1, "It's been so long since we've had any contact with the Greybeards. Do you really have the Voice?": 1, "It's been so long since I tasted my own blood. Sour.": 1, "It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing.": 1, "It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed \"oomph.\"": 1, "It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven.": 1, "It's an honor, Keeper of the Ring.": 1, "It's an honor to serve the Skaal as shaman, but I still miss my father.": 1, "It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost.": 1, "It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.": 1, "It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.": 1, "It's a shrine, for... Err, I don't remember.": 1, "It's a shrine, I think. But I don't remember where it came from.": 1, "It's a shrine to... I don't remember. Isn't that strange?": 1, "It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?": 1, "It's a shame. There are quite a few tales of General Carius's exploits, including the founding of Raven Rock.": 1, "It's a shame, isn't it?": 1, "It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.": 1, "It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.": 1, "It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us.": 1, "It's a shame about Varona.": 1, "It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point.": 1, "It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.": 1, "It's a religious thing.": 1, "It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.": 1, "It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew.": 1, "It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful.": 1, "It's a private matter. Let's just say they seek revenge for the execution of one of their own... ordered by Councilor Morvayn himself.": 1, "It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice.": 1, "It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.": 1, "It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.": 1, "It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich.": 1, "It's a lot of nonsense to me, but they seem to get by.": 1, "It's a long way to the next city if you change your mind.": 1, "It's a long story.": 1, "It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?": 1, "It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet.": 1, "It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows.": 1, "It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon.": 1, "It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But...": 1, "It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.": 1, "It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!": 1, "It's an honor to see you, the keeper of Namira's ring.": 1, "It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes.": 1, "It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.": 1, "It's an amulet that was made exclusively for the East Empire Company.": 1, "It's amazing what I'm able to learn from studying these Dwemer plans.": 1, "It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.": 1, "It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?": 1, "It's always good to see someone I can count on.": 1, "It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.": 1, "It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.": 1, "It's also quite possible that there are some other isolated conclaves of snow elves nestled elsewhere on Nirn.": 1, "It's almost time to feed the mushrooms. They like a drop of blood every now and then you know.": 1, "It's almost all I have time for these days.": 1, "It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.": 1, "It's all up to you now... Listener.": 1, "It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two smooth the rough edges.": 1, "It's all thanks to a special technique I developed. I call it the \"Razor-Winged Butterfly.\" I'd teach it to you... but then I'd have to kill you.": 1, "It's a wonder people can get anywhere around here. Maybe I'll avoid this entire hold for awhile. That said... I do have a few things to sell.": 1, "It's abandoned and it's always been abandoned.": 1, "It's about time you got here.": 1, "It's about time; I sent them a letter weeks ago. That Elgrim... he'd forget his own pants if his wife didn't help him dress.": 1, "It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about.": 1, "It's all about sizing up your mark, lad.": 1, "It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun.": 1, "It's all about sizing up your mark, lass.": 1, "It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again.": 1, "It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right.": 1, "It's all in this note.": 1, "It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say.": 1, "It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say.": 1, "It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.": 1, "It's all been for nothing.": 1, "It appears that way. I suppose he wanted to put the past behind him.": 1, "It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death.": 1, "It was a pleasure, thank you.": 1, "It is good to meet you in person.": 1, "It is good to know that I will not have to do it alone. I am glad this Dawnguard exists.": 1, "It is good to have powerful allies, is it not?": 1, "It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.": 1, "It is good to finally be around mages who may be able to keep up with J'zargo.": 1, "It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend.": 1, "It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!": 1, "It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all.": 1, "It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time.": 1, "It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.": 1, "It is eerily quiet. I do not suspect that will be the case the further we go. Be on your guard.": 1, "It is done. I won't go back to Avanchnzel. I won't.": 1, "It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives.": 1, "It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help.": 1, "It is good to see you again, my friend. Did you find the elves at their ship?": 1, "It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.": 1, "It is called \"Dragonrend\", but its Words of Power are unknown to us.": 1, "It is an... artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm... fragments of creation. ": 1, "It is an honor to serve Harkon, is it not?": 1, "It is an ancient stone of power, a connection to the All-Maker.": 1, "It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals.": 1, "It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice.": 1, "It is a shame though.": 1, "It is a shame that was necessary.": 1, "It is a rather well-kept secret.": 1, "It is a pitiable fate. And one that I fear has fallen to my brother.": 1, "It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies.": 1, "It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further.": 1, "It is a fine day to work the mines.": 1, "It is a dark thing, unnatural. I would have nothing to do with it. But the Dark Elf Wizard, Neloth...": 1, "It is called \"Force\" in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back.": 1, "It is a cherished gift you have given me. To see the world this way, through your eyes. It will only bring us closer.": 1, "It is good to see you again.": 1, "It is imperative that you return to your College at once.": 1, "It is time for you to go, outsider.": 1, "It is time for us to go.": 1, "It is time for action.": 1, "It is the will of the All-Maker that we cut firewood only from the dead trees.": 1, "It is the only place where silt striders can be found.": 1, "It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.": 1, "It is the great spire at the heart of the Imperial City, among the tallest towers in all of Tamriel.": 1, "It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite.": 1, "It is so.": 1, "It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.": 1, "It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?": 1, "It is rather impressive.": 1, "It is planning on starting a fire?": 1, "It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained.": 1, "It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.": 1, "It is our sacred duty to study the Elder Scrolls.": 1, "It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.": 1, "It is not safe here! We must go back to the village!": 1, "It is not right that I should say this, because I must honor my father's wishes, but this is a path I never chose.": 1, "It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.": 1, "It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here.": 1, "It is no wonder the dragons razed his temple to the ground. Seeing the remains hung up like trophies must have enraged them to no end.": 1, "It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.": 1, "It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show.": 1, "It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.": 1, "It is my sworn duty to see Arkay's wrath delivered to all the undead. It's usually a good bit of fun, too.": 1, "It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song.": 1, "It is my job to know these things.": 1, "It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last.": 1, "It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance.": 1, "It is our most favored company.": 1, "It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.": 1, "It is Baldor Iron-Shaper. As our only smith, Baldor is very important to the village.": 1, "It involves carefully removing the bark from a Canticle Tree which will in turn attract Ancestor Moths to you.": 1, "It does not.": 1, "It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them.": 1, "It does not matter to M'aiq how strong or smart one is. It only matters what one can do.": 1, "It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise...": 1, "It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. \"No, it won't be too cold\" he said.": 1, "It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.": 1, "It describes a discovery that was made in the mine by some of the diggers. They wanted Gratian to take a closer look.": 1, "It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.": 1, "It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up.": 1, "It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir.": 1, "It certainly seems the Vigilants of Stendarr can't help themselves. No surprise there.": 1, "It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...": 1, "It certainly is. Was, I suppose.": 1, "It cannot... end like this...": 1, "It does. The College has caused enough problems; don't need you or anyone else adding to them.": 1, "It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.": 1, "It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?": 1, "It can't be helped.": 1, "It can take months or even years to complete a single scroll and even then, months to recover.": 1, "It can stay for now, but if it so much as lays a finger on anyone here, I'll hold you responsible. Got it?": 1, "It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.": 1, "It can follow the magical link back to its summoner.": 1, "It can be. Even the most experienced warriors can fall prey to petty distractions.": 1, "It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.": 1, "It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?": 1, "It brings me great comfort to know that Nikulas will stay. I thank you, outsider.": 1, "It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.": 1, "It belongs among our kind, not gathering mold in some vagabond's treasure pile.": 1, "It begins again.": 1, "It became quickly apparent that the best way I could help would be by wiping out the cliff racers.": 1, "It cannot be much farther now. I feel it in my bones.": 1, "It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?": 1, "It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here.": 1, "It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now.": 1, "It helped avert attention from our true nature.": 1, "It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.": 1, "It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn.": 1, "It has done a good thing. It will take this gift as a token of gratitude.": 1, "It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other.": 1, "It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.": 1, "It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.": 1, "It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!": 1, "It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.": 1, "It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed.": 1, "It had to be one of us, and, well, she's so much more powerful than I am. It just made sense for her to be out here.": 1, "It had rolling green plains and swamps and verdant hills too.": 1, "It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.": 1, "It gets lonely out here you know, on this remote island.": 1, "It generally doesn't occur until a Moth Priest is in his latter years, but in my case I simply wasn't preparing myself properly.": 1, "It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it. ": 1, "It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.": 1, "It doesn't matter, Adril. I'm responsible for those people and I'll make whatever sacrifices are necessary to keep them alive.": 1, "It doesn't matter, my husband. Let's simply cherish the time we have for now.": 1, "It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.": 1, "It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak.": 1, "It don't matter now. None of it does. Just leave me be.": 1, "It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything.": 1, "It is time to cull the weak.": 1, "It drives Kuvar mad, but someone has to do it or the place would be a little... cold.": 1, "It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.": 1, "It ends here!": 1, "It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it.": 1, "It feels... old, doesn't it? Even by dwarven standards. No one has been here in thousands of years.": 1, "It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake.": 1, "It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?": 1, "It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished.": 1, "It was a pleasure.": 1, "It is time!": 1, "It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing.": 1, "It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.": 1, "It speaks truthfully.": 1, "It speaks the truth.": 1, "It sounds like... that's the last bit of the prophecy. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour can corrupt the bow.": 1, "It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why.": 1, "It shouldn't have been like this.": 1, "It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.": 1, "It should put on some coverings.": 1, "It should provide an additional spectral tether from your own lifespark to the aedric realm.": 1, "It should now be as simple as using the cubes to turn on the four boilers.": 1, "It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.": 1, "It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.": 1, "It should be careful with those flames.": 1, "It should be among our kind, not laying about unguarded for mortals to find.": 1, "It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.": 1, "It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study.": 1, "It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.": 1, "It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.": 1, "It seems those tales are true.": 1, "It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells.": 1, "It seems they wanted to send a message to the other Vigilants still walking the roads of Skyrim.": 1, "It seems these rings can be moved.": 1, "It seems there's this strange button on the wall opposite the fireplace in my house. Always wondered what it was for.": 1, "It seems the dwarves were as interested in the Black Books as we are.": 1, "It seems the ancient Dwemer discovered this book and took it to study.": 1, "It seems that predators have taken up residence and have been attacking farmers and travelers.": 1, "It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.": 1, "It seems that a predator has invaded their home, and someone needs to clear the beast out.": 1, "It seems our work is not yet done. But I have waited this long, and we are so very close now. I can wait a bit longer.": 1, "It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us.": 1, "It seems you've inherited a situation.": 1, "It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.": 1, "It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?": 1, "It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked. Trust me on that.": 1, "It was a pleasure to talk to someone so interesting.": 1, "It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.": 1, "It was a little... quieter... back then. Guess a little vampire girl was enough to scare off the rats.": 1, "It was a good hunt.": 1, "It was a few years ago. A few of the mages got overconfident and were exiled. They had no talent, anyway.": 1, "It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.": 1, "It was a cold day. The end of Frostfall is nearly winter in the Jerall Mountains.": 1, "It was a cadre of dremora. The city was under attack.": 1, "It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit.": 1, "It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.": 1, "It was Skaf the Giant, our former chieftan, who taught me the ways of battle.": 1, "It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity.": 1, "It was Miraak who threatened Solstheim. With him gone, Herma-Mora has been foiled once again.": 1, "It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children.": 1, "It takes a brave soul to wander onto my deck. It'll take more than that to leave in one piece.": 1, "It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young.": 1, "It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died.": 1, "It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father.": 1, "It used to be one of the richest ebony mines in Morrowind, but it dried out years ago.": 1, "It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.": 1, "It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot.": 1, "It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.": 1, "It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine?": 1, "It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own.": 1, "It took courage to rescue me from the elves, and I thank you for that.": 1, "It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep.": 1, "It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.": 1, "It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?": 1, "It takes a while to make a dress, Dagny. You have to be patient.": 1, "It takes a strong will to command a dragon's soul. Perhaps you aren't as powerful as you think.": 1, "It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others.": 1, "It seems he was held in high regard by both men and dragons, because he defeated a traitor named Miraak.": 1, "It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.": 1, "It seemed as though you were not really here. I could see you, but also see through you!": 1, "It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.": 1, "It may be time to replace him with a more loyal servant. One who still appreciates the gifts that I have to offer.": 1, "It may be justified, but it certainly isn't appreciated. Councilor Morvayn simply feels that I'm being paranoid.": 1, "It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads back to Cyrodiil.": 1, "It makes us right.": 1, "It makes them forget themselves, and work on these horrible creations that corrupt the Stones, the very land itself.": 1, "It makes my heart heavy, to think of killing a beast when we have no need of its hide or its meat. That is not our way.": 1, "It makes my heart heavy that you don't believe me, Fanari. Baldor could be in danger, and you will do nothing.": 1, "It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.": 1, "It looks like you already have someone with you. If you want me to join, you'll have to part ways with them first.": 1, "It looks like we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress.": 1, "It looks like this is as close as we're going to get being safe from the vampires.": 1, "It looks like there's another lever over on the other side.": 1, "It looks like there is only one way to proceed. ": 1, "It may have driven my family apart, but I'm still here, and I'm alive. I won't give this up.": 1, "It looks like some kind of temple.": 1, "It looks like it's beginning to wear off.": 1, "It looks like a secret entrance opened up along the wall. You lead the way.": 1, "It looks like I was right. He was taken in by that...": 1, "It killed my great-grandfather, and left Raven Rock with a worthless and tainted mine.": 1, "It just feels so slow.": 1, "It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do.": 1, "It is. Well, I assume it is. I haven't been able to find the entrance.": 1, "It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.": 1, "It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either.  ": 1, "It is.": 1, "It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.": 1, "It is when my customers waste time chatting, and not buying.": 1, "It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly.": 1, "It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles.": 1, "It looks like most of the cubes were moved to the lower levels, perhaps to try to control the flooding before the city was abandoned.": 1, "It may not be \"official\", but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on.": 1, "It may seem cruel that we hold our thin-blooded kin in low esteem. But our needs must come before theirs.": 1, "It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about.": 1, "It says that he was loyal, and his reward was an honorable death. Quite fascinating.": 1, "It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.": 1, "It represents one of the aspects of nature, a part of the All-Maker's creation.": 1, "It pleases me to see you again.": 1, "It pleases me to see you again, my patron.": 1, "It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.": 1, "It pleases me to hear you say so.": 1, "It pains me to think you'd travel with Serana under the guise of her protector in an effort to hunt me down.": 1, "It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs.": 1, "It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself.": 1, "It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...": 1, "It must have been important to the vampires as well, for them to risk an open attack on the Vigilants.": 1, "It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.": 1, "It might take more than a simple request to change Geldis's mind. He can be quite stubborn.": 1, "It might take decades to restore the castle to its former glory... but I appear to have plenty of time.": 1, "It might appear brittle, but I'd wager it could stop the blow of a weapon better than iron or steel.": 1, "It meant passing on better opportunities at home, but I didn't want to leave his side.": 1, "It may. It should. And I will think on what you ask of me, to decide if it is necessary, or just another of Herma-Mora's tricks.": 1, "It means \"Dwarven Museum.\" Lost race of people that built the city.": 1, "It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.": 1, "It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!": 1, "It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.": 1, "It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one.": 1, "It is time, Yamarz.": 1, "It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that.": 1, "It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening.": 1, "It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath.": 1, "It means what I feared has come to pass. Miraak was never truly gone, and now has returned.": 1, "It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side.": 1, "It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say.": 1, "It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.": 1, "It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!": 1, "Life here is better than you could find anywhere in Skyrim.": 1, "Life is far too short, my friend. Don't waste it!": 1, "Life never truly ends. Death is just a passage from one form to the next.": 1, "Never mind then, lass. If you change your mind, come find me.": 1, "Never mind then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me.": 1, "Never made it far in the Companions, but now... I'd like to see any of them try and call me \"whelp\" again.": 1, "Never heard of them talking to anybody before. If they really do want to talk to you, you'd better go find out what they want. You never know.": 1, "Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings.": 1, "Never expected so blatant an attack by vampires, of all creatures.": 1, "Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?": 1, "Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lad?": 1, "Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.": 1, "Nervous?": 1, "Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets.": 1, "Nepos the Nose? He's been in Markarth forever. And he's well-respected among the natives of the Reach.": 1, "Nepos the Nose handles that part of our business. He has a way with the workers.": 1, "Nepos is in charge. That's all I know.": 1, "Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me, and you'll be a great man one day.": 1, "Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.": 1, "Neloth is crazy! I hear he talks to mud crabs.": 1, "Neloth is a real task master.": 1, "Neloth is a master wizard of the House Telvanni.": 1, "Neither do I.": 1, "Needless to say, we can't abide that, as it would raise general alarm amongst the herd, to say nothing of the increased feeding competition.": 1, "Needless to say, these rebels and I have no love for each other. ": 1, "Need to get going. What is it?": 1, "Need to get back to my anvil.": 1, "Need to get back to chopping.": 1, "Need something? Unlike the rest of my family, I've got work to do. ": 1, "Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir.": 1, "Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.": 1, "Need some metal hammered?": 1, "Need anything, you just say the word.": 1, "Neloth may be crazy, but it's better than staying in Raven Rock.": 1, "Need anything else, just let me know.": 1, "Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now.": 1, "Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak. ": 1, "New to Markarth?": 1, "New sister. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.": 1, "New recruits? Hmm.": 1, "New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted.": 1, "New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn.": 1, "New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected.": 1, "New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess.": 1, "New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one.": 1, "New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better.": 1, "New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.": 1, "New blood, eh? Let's get something very clear.": 1, "New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.": 1, "Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so.": 1, "Never... not yet...": 1, "Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.": 1, "Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.": 1, "Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.": 1, "Never. Now move aside.": 1, "Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!": 1, "Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave.": 1, "Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul.": 1, "Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells.": 1, "Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend.": 1, "Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.": 1, "Never should have come here...": 1, "Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.": 1, "Never seen a crossbow before, eh? Not surprised. Kind of a Dawnguard specialty. Nothing better for putting down vampires.": 1, "Never see me strutting around like that!": 1, "Never saw anything like this back on the island.": 1, "Never said that. Just that we don't get many of you wanting to join, that's all.": 1, "Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us.": 1, "Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use.": 1, "Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.": 1, "Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?": 1, "Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller.": 1, "Names have power, lass. You should know by now. Just say \"Velehk Sain, I release you.\", and \"Poof!\", I'm on my way.": 1, "Names have power, lad. You should know by now. Just say \"Velehk Sain, I release you.\", and \"Poof!\", I'm on my way.": 1, "Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.": 1, "Name's Samuel. Never met my parents. Grelod said my mother worked here at the Orphanage, but she died when I was born.": 1, "Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.": 1, "Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me.": 1, "Name's Angi and if you try anything stupid I won't hesitate to put in arrow in your head.": 1, "Name is Stig Salt-Plank, one of the captains of the Blood Horkers.": 1, "Naked. Naked, naked, naked!": 1, "Nahl...": 1, "Nahkriin fah zaamhus!": 1, "Nahagliiv! Ziil gro dovah ulse!": 1, "Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.": 1, "Namira covets your ugliness.": 1, "Nah. He... finds things people are looking for. Makes a good bit of coin doing it, too.": 1, "Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it.": 1, "Nah Kest!": 1, "N'wah!": 1, "Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!": 1, "My... my what, now?": 1, "My... my parents died, not too long ago. I... I don't know what to do...": 1, "My... my parents died, and... and now I'm all alone...": 1, "My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.": 1, "My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.": 1, "My, my. What do we have here?": 1, "My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now.": 1, "My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable.": 1, "My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me what I want, and I will give you what you seek.": 1, "My wife. They killed her.": 1, "Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager.": 1, "Namira grants us victory.": 1, "Namira grind your bones for my bread!": 1, "Namira spoke to you? I knew this feast was going to be something.": 1, "Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.": 1, "Need a room, talk to Delphine.": 1, "Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several.": 1, "Need a new blade?": 1, "Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar.": 1, "Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed...": 1, "Need a dagger? No? How about a claymore?": 1, "Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used.": 1, "Neat weapon. You're not going to hurt anybody, though. Right?": 1, "Nearly thirty years, now.": 1, "Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!": 1, "Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain.": 1, "Nchuand-Zel? The ruins underneath Markarth? The wealth of artifacts that I've based two human lifetimes of research on?": 1, "Nchardak. The 'City of a Hundred Towers'. In its day, it was the largest of the great Dwemer Archives, and perhaps the most advanced.": 1, "Nchardak, an ancient Dwemer city, on the eastern side of Solstheim. It's largely flooded now, but luckily the main library is still above the water.": 1, "Nazir told me what happened in Solitude. You poor dear. You've been through so much...": 1, "Naw... he's fine. Look, I wanted to ask if you'll... um, if you'd like to... well, like to have a drink with me at the Bee and Barb sometime?": 1, "Namira watch over you, champion.": 1, "Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment.": 1, "Narfi so happy! So happy! So happy!": 1, "Narfi's happy now. Maybe Narfi can sleep. Sleep all night. Sleep, sleep, sleep.": 1, "Narfi's sad now. Still wait for Reyda. No more sleep. No, no... no.": 1, "Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.": 1, "New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place.": 1, "Narri, do you think the war will ever end?": 1, "Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied.": 1, "Nasty little buggers, aren't they?": 1, "Nature is out of balance. The very air feels wrong. Solstheim is in great danger.": 1, "Nature will do the rest.": 1, "Nature will take care of the rest.": 1, "Naw, mostly just froze.": 1, "Nasty bitches, aren't they? Here's your fee.": 1, "My wife's quite the alchemist. Thanks to her, my ash yams are growing quicker than ever before.": 1, "New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill.": 1, "Next season for sure... What? Uncle Calcelmo, I don't understand what you mean.": 1, "No match at all.": 1, "No man is a match for a dragon.": 1, "No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?": 1, "No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.": 1, "No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission.": 1, "No idea what's causing it though.": 1, "No husks, no sale. Guess you have some scavenging to do.": 1, "No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him.": 1, "No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me.": 1, "No harm is meant to you, happy fool.": 1, "No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.": 1, "No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers.": 1, "No going back that way, now.": 1, "No funny business. I'm watching you.": 1, "No match for my magic.": 1, "No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.": 1, "No escape this time, foul worm!": 1, "No dovah would stoop to such vile tahrovin.": 1, "No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.": 1, "No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.": 1, "No doubt they still tell tales of Mikael and his sweet songs across Cyrodiil, where last I traveled.": 1, "No doubt there's some connection between these pressure plates and opening the next chamber.": 1, "No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.": 1, "No doubt just as Hermaeus Mora intended. He is a fickle master, you know.": 1, "No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.": 1, "No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.": 1, "No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do.": 1, "No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart.": 1, "No day goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin krif horvut se suleyk.": 1, "No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.": 1, "No fear, hunters! Only strength!": 1, "No breaks for a good worker out here.": 1, "No matter how long I've been here, I'll still never get used to this place.": 1, "No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back.": 1, "No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?": 1, "No need to thank me. I know you are overwhelmed with gratitude.": 1, "No need to tell him about it when he gets back. He knows all about this.": 1, "No need to involve Master Neloth in this. It's just between the two of us.": 1, "No need to get snippy.": 1, "No need to get rough!": 1, "No need to get hasty. I... I was just testing you. You can go on ahead.": 1, "No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods.": 1, "No need to do that now.": 1, "No need to bother with giants right now. Just keep your distance.": 1, "No need to bother him about it though. He's quite busy at the moment.": 1, "No mother should have to bury her daughter.": 1, "No more.... No more.... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!": 1, "No more. I'm done with you.": 1, "No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.": 1, "No more than anyone else, I don't think.": 1, "No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies.": 1, "No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk.": 1, "No mercy!": 1, "No mercy for the weak!": 1, "No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.": 1, "No matter. Serana will sacrifice her blood for the sake of the prophecy, and I will feast upon yours in Molag Bal's honor!": 1, "No matter. I have found a new Dragonborn to serve me.": 1, "No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.": 1, "No matter. Another one will be along any time now.": 1, "No matter, I appreciate your generosity.": 1, "No matter where the road takes us, my thoughts are of home.": 1, "No matter what, we stay together, Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him.": 1, "No matter what, the College will endure.": 1, "No matter what Hrothmund says, we need a leader. And I'm still the best person for that.": 1, "No more than I was already getting.": 1, "No answer? Then I'll take it from your corpse!": 1, "No Mulush. I'll work harder.": 1, "No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.": 1, "Next, the wood elf!": 1, "Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!": 1, "Next, the lizard!": 1, "Next, the high elf!": 1, "Next, the dark elf!": 1, "Next, the cat!": 1, "Next, the Redguard!": 1, "Next, the Orc!": 1, "Next, the Nord in the rags!": 1, "Next, the Breton!": 1, "Next to the door, the room on the left.": 1, "Next time, then.": 1, "Next time, keep your plans quieter and nothing would have happened to it.": 1, "Next time, deal with Avenicci.": 1, "Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?": 1, "Next time, come see my at my shop. I've got some things you'll just love.": 1, "Next time you're hungry, stop by... I always have plenty of food for sale.": 1, "Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!": 1, "Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs.": 1, "Next time you feel like having a conversation, talk to someone else.": 1, "Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away.": 1, "Next time think before you speak.": 1, "Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune.": 1, "Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively.": 1, "Next time I say to please not go over the waterfall, maybe you'll listen to me.": 1, "Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words.": 1, "Next thing you know there will be some kind of damn blight and undead will walk the land.": 1, "Next thing I remember, I was here and they were gone. That's not right, losing whole days like that.": 1, "Next thing I knew, I arrived here.": 1, "Next season, nephew. Next season for sure....": 1, "Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!": 1, "Nice job hitting those targets.": 1, "Nice place you have here. I never knew you were so wealthy.": 1, "Nice shot! Right on target.": 1, "No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.": 1, "No Ash Guardian. Maybe the book has something.": 1, "Nnnnooowwwwwww....": 1, "Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise.": 1, "Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.": 1, "Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.": 1, "Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het.": 1, "Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!": 1, "Nirya...": 1, "Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.": 1, "Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?": 1, "Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?": 1, "Nikulas is restless. He's like an eagle, always seeking to fly somewhere new.": 1, "Nikulas is all that I have left in this world. I know it is selfish of me to say so, but I cannot lose him. Not while I still grieve.": 1, "Nightwielder's creations don't really hold up in comparison to what can be made today, but they have a sentimental value for me. You understand.": 1, "Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.": 1, "Night of Tears, eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting.": 1, "Nice talkin' with you.": 1, "Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.": 1, "Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.": 1, "Nice to see a fellow Dunmer following the traditional customs.": 1, "Nice touch about the High King.": 1, "Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much.": 1, "New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead.": 1, "Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush.": 1, "Nice try, fat-fingers!": 1, "Nice weapon you got there. Care to put it away?": 1, "Nice weapon you have there. But I don't suppose you'd consider putting it away?": 1, "Nice!": 1, "Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine.": 1, "Night of Tears, by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about.": 1, "Nice try, but those bandits almost killed me. Now pay up.": 1, "No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.": 1, "My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.": 1, "My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her.": 1, "My king. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.": 1, "My joy knows no bounds. Here. A little payment for your troubles.": 1, "My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel.": 1, "My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much. ": 1, "My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers.": 1, "My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.": 1, "My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out.": 1, "My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his \"pretty Juniper.\"": 1, "My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.": 1, "My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf.": 1, "My husband owns it, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same.": 1, "My husband just gets cranky when he doesn't get enough sleep.": 1, "My husband is second councilor, so I certainly have the means to reward you if you find my folio.": 1, "My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.": 1, "My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.": 1, "My husband and I were just recently married.": 1, "My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.": 1, "My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.": 1, "My husband Garyn maintains our farm. Without him, Raven Rock would likely go hungry.": 1, "My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds.": 1, "My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.": 1, "My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.": 1, "My honor isn't so cheap, outlander.": 1, "My heart is still wounded from the loss of your father. I cannot lose my only son so soon after.": 1, "My heart is still heavy with the loss of my father.": 1, "My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family.": 1, "My hatred for the Empire is exceeded only by my hatred for their witch-elf puppet-masters.": 1, "My hands weren't made for building things. Thanks for getting us off that project up there.": 1, "My guards told me. Poor Margret. And witnesses report that the attacker was shouting some nonsense about being a Forsworn.": 1, "My greatest fear is that my stubborn mule of a husband will end up suffering the same fate.": 1, "My husband Vendil feared visitors would shun Raven Rock. I'm glad to see he was mistaken.": 1, "My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws.": 1, "My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie.": 1, "My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?": 1, "My mother fell in love with one of the sailors - my father - and eventually returned with him to Skyrim.": 1, "My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.": 1, "My mother and father brought me here a year ago. They said they'd be back soon, but... they're awfully late.": 1, "My mother always used to say that too.": 1, "My mistake. A manservant wouldn't let me starve or freeze. I let you live here, and now I'm two steps closer to the grave.": 1, "My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.": 1, "My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?": 1, "My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.": 1, "My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders.": 1, "My men have laid down their lives to keep Raven Rock safe. We've fought too hard to leave. We can't just let it all go.": 1, "My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.": 1, "My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him.": 1, "My ma died, and... and I don't know what to do...": 1, "My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow.": 1, "My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind.": 1, "My loss, right?": 1, "My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.": 1, "My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once.": 1, "My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly.": 1, "My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted.": 1, "My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!": 1, "My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.": 1, "My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.": 1, "My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?": 1, "My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?": 1, "My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup.": 1, "My life's work. Unraveling one of the great mysteries of the dwarves.": 1, "My last patron was a true Nord. He was dressed in animal skins, had tattoos on his face...  a real traditional type, if you know what I mean.": 1, "My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.": 1, "My lady, you have my deepest sympathies. I am sure this was not easy for you.": 1, "My lord. Please. You have to listen.": 1, "My goodness, you're quite resourceful aren't you?": 1, "My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked.": 1, "My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?": 1, "My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.": 1, "My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past.": 1, "My family's home is west of Solitude. If you help me get back there, they'll be grateful to you.": 1, "My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would guess they still do.": 1, "My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.": 1, "My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say.": 1, "My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.": 1, "My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.": 1, "My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.": 1, "My family has its problems, but they're our problems.": 1, "My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.": 1, "My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.": 1, "My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.": 1, "My eyes inside Cidhna Mine tell me that Madanach is dead.": 1, "My father Storn, our shaman, says Miraak has returned to Solstheim, but that is impossible.": 1, "My eyes are sharp.": 1, "My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.": 1, "My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!": 1, "My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.": 1, "My ears are always open to a friend's request.": 1, "My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.": 1, "My duty is to guard Brina Merilis.": 1, "My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably.": 1, "My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.": 1, "My doors are open if you wish to discuss matters involving Raven Rock.": 1, "My desire to speak with you was born from the result of our battle, Qahnaarin.": 1, "My debt is repaid at last.": 1, "My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.": 1, "My dear, I am merely observing the proceedings.": 1, "My dear vagrant, we're the only family worth knowing in Markarth. We own everything in this city, even the jail.": 1, "My experiments continue to go well thanks to you. How can I return the favor?": 1, "My father Storn, the shaman, protects them in the village. ": 1, "My father and I don't really get along.": 1, "My father and mother are the richest on the island... and that includes Councilor Morvayn.": 1, "My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.": 1, "My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine.": 1, "My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!": 1, "My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!": 1, "My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself.": 1, "My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too.": 1, "My friend Marex. We were hunting, and I thought he was an elk.": 1, "My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. \"You're being mean, Frodnar!\" So what if I am?": 1, "My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.": 1, "My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city.": 1, "My fingers are too short. I can't get them out!": 1, "My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.": 1, "My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.": 1, "My father... no, not really. I did spend a lot of time with my mother, but she saw me more like a protege than a daughter.": 1, "My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind.": 1, "My father's never been much for building things, so it just stayed like this.": 1, "My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow.": 1, "My father doesn't know anything about me. ": 1, "My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice.": 1, "My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.": 1, "My father needs me. He can't run his market stand alone.": 1, "My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.": 1, "My father owned it until he... passed on.": 1, "My mother had a bit of a thing for magical constructs. Not... not what you're thinking. She just found them fascinating.": 1, "My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.": 1, "My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers.": 1, "My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.": 1, "My father was a Stormcloak soldier. One day, he left and... didn't come back.": 1, "My father was a noble man, and a true Skaal.": 1, "My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family. ": 1, "My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.": 1, "My father taught me an important lesson many years ago.": 1, "My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same.": 1, "My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.": 1, "My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own.": 1, "My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise.": 1, "My strength falters. We do not have much time.": 1, "My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.": 1, "My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed.": 1, "My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.": 1, "My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.": 1, "My soul is now prepared.": 1, "My son? Erik? What about him? Did something happen? Is he alright?": 1, "My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride.": 1, "My son's heart was restless. He wanted to see the world beyond our lands, and nothing I said could change his mind.": 1, "My son's heart is restless. He wants to see the world beyond our lands, and nothing I say will change his mind.": 1, "My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!": 1, "My son and I gather items to trade with travelers who visit the village.": 1, "My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought.": 1, "My sword will taste of your blood!": 1, "My sister passed away some years ago, so I settled down here and opened the House of Curiosities.": 1, "My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice.": 1, "My sister in darkness. While it's good to see you, we'll keep up appearances, yes?": 1, "My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!": 1, "My sister and I inherited a modest sum of money. We decided to travel and seek out whatever adventures we could find.": 1, "My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat.": 1, "My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out.": 1, "My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.": 1, "My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. We like to collect things.": 1, "My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.": 1, "My sincerest pardons, I but look after your own peace of mind.": 1, "My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it.": 1, "My ship's ready to sail if you've brought enough gold.": 1, "My servant Miraak would have found a way to bring me what I want. So will you, if you wish to surpass him.": 1, "My second! If we're going to take up residence here again, I need to get the blessing of Hrothmund again.": 1, "My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living.": 1, "My second would do well to keep his mouth shut.": 1, "My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.": 1, "My thanks. I feel... better.": 1, "My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.  ": 1, "My wife is dead! Dead!": 1, "My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?": 1, "My wife and I were cleaning out our home, and we came across some of my great-grandfather's things locked in an old chest.": 1, "My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way.": 1, "My wife and I are doing the best we can to keep Raven Rock fed.": 1, "My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.": 1, "My wife Kerah runs our jewelry stall in the market.": 1, "My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed.": 1, "My wife Beitild is dead. Can't say I miss that old sabre cat.": 1, "My what? Wait. That means...": 1, "My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me.": 1, "My vision darkens, and I see no more.": 1, "My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic.": 1, "My thanks to you.": 1, "My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down.": 1, "My trip to Skyrim has become quite the adventure!": 1, "My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between.": 1, "My traitor wife stole one of them away and then disappeared.": 1, "My title is just a formality. I've always been in charge around here.": 1, "My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master.": 1, "My time... has come...": 1, "My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill.": 1, "My time is limited, so speak quickly.": 1, "My time has come. I am old. Too old to become chief. It would be wrong for me to take wives at this age. So I will die.": 1, "My time has come again.": 1, "My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.": 1, "My thuri Miraak is the only true Dovahkiin.": 1, "My thoughts exactly, my friend.": 1, "My thoughts are always with my people.": 1, "My tunic is fading. Too much sun and salt spray.": 1, "My second would do well to keep her mouth shut.": 1, "My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.": 1, "My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them.": 1, "My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.": 1, "My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall.": 1, "My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.": 1, "My only aim is to keep the peace.": 1, "My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.": 1, "My offer is still a thousand. Did you want to sell?": 1, "My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here.": 1, "My note? No, that's yours. Must have fallen out of your pocket.": 1, "My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.": 1, "My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you.": 1, "My necropsies of Spriggans led me to believe that a heart stone could be implanted in a person's chest, granting them great power.": 1, "My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course.": 1, "My name is Serana. Who sent you here?": 1, "My name is Serana. Were you... sent to wake me?": 1, "My only worry is her \"Keeper.\" I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary.": 1, "My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. ": 1, "My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake.": 1, "My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall.": 1, "My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you.": 1, "My mother's not any help, either.": 1, "My mother's dead, but I won't close the inn. I've hired Leontius to run things.": 1, "My mother was meticulous about her research. If we can find her notes, there might be some hints in there.": 1, "My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade. ": 1, "My mother was Skaal, but she left the village and I was born in Skyrim.": 1, "My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude.": 1, "My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up.": 1, "My mother taught me a trick or two. I could partially soul trap you, and offer that gem to the Ideal Masters. It might be enough to satisfy them.": 1, "My mother spent a lot of time trying to contact them directly, to travel to the Soul Cairn itself. ": 1, "My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.": 1, "My mother put me on a boat to Skyrim. The last time I ever saw her, she was standing on the dock as my ship sailed away.": 1, "My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... \"continue the Hlaalu tradition.\" Bah! I left all that nonsense behind.": 1, "My orders are to tell the riff-raff to use the North Gate, that's it.": 1, "My pa always warned me about these things!": 1, "My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.": 1, "My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.": 1, "My road takes me home, outsider. Hunt well.": 1, "My problem with her? She's the one who has a problem with me!": 1, "My prison. The source of half the silver in Skyrim. The most secure prison in Tamriel.": 1, "My primary concern is your safety, Councilor. I give you my word that no harm will befall you while I stand by your side.": 1, "My presence in Tamriel would simply double the risk that Harkon could complete the prophecy.": 1, "My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College.": 1, "My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there.": 1, "My power is supreme!": 1, "My position, \"Dean of History,\" actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life.": 1, "My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better.": 1, "My point exactly.": 1, "My pleasure.": 1, "My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned...": 1, "My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.": 1, "My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago.": 1, "My pay will be nothing if we die in here!": 1, "My pa died, and... and now I'm all alone.": 1, "My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me.": 1, "My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.": 1, "My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change. ": 1, "My pa was a sailor. Took me with him on his last trip. After he got sick, they... put us off here and left without us.": 1, "My pa's axe, Stendarr preserve us.": 1, "My mother kept this a secret, even from me. She must have been up to something she thought was dangerous.": 1, "My papa died and... and I'm all alone...": 1, "My parents are being impossible.": 1, "My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.": 1, "My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.": 1, "My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately.": 1, "My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?": 1, "My patron took one look at me, and made the most menacing grin I'd ever seen.": 1, "My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means \"smart,\" but my brother says he's wrong.": 1, "My dear girl, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?": 1, "No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about.": 1, "No offense, but you're not looking so good. Are you feeling ill?": 1, "Noooo....": 1, "Nooo!": 1, "Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.": 1, "Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.": 1, "Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and \"commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old\" and blah blah.": 1, "Nonsense. Is a child who learns to read \"not a scholar\" of literature? Is a smith's apprentice \"not a scholar\" of blacksmithing?": 1, "Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must.": 1, "Nonsense. A few Dwemer Spiders will pop out, we kill them, and the Treasure of Kagrumez will be ours!": 1, "Nonsense, you're a vital part of my research team. You'll be there, have no fear! Now, I don't want to hear another word of protest.": 1, "Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.": 1, "Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power.": 1, "None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?": 1, "None. Not back to him.": 1, "None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them.": 1, "Nope, sorry. Nothing.": 1, "None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones.": 1, "None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already!": 1, "None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette.": 1, "None of this makes any sense. What does she have to do with this?": 1, "None of this feels right. We need to know more.": 1, "None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.": 1, "None of the others ever made it this far.": 1, "None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems.": 1, "None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough.": 1, "None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.": 1, "None of my business.": 1, "None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six.": 1, "None know its origins, but the stories say that men who hear its music are compelled to dance uncontrollably, no matter the peril.": 1, "None escape the Vigil. All come into the light.": 1, "None can deny your power now.": 1, "None shall stand against Miraak!": 1, "Non-believers are never welcome here.": 1, "Nope. Not even close.": 1, "Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.": 1, "Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.": 1, "Not again!": 1, "Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten.": 1, "Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.": 1, "Not a lot of our kind here, I see. Suppose I shouldn't be surprised.": 1, "Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.": 1, "Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.": 1, "Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.": 1, "Not a day goes by I don't ask that question myself, my dear.  ": 1, "Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact.": 1, "Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe her my life, in fact.": 1, "Not a chance. Get'em, boys!": 1, "Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe.": 1, "North, I think, then they turned west and that's the last I saw of them.": 1, "Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!": 1, "Normally, the study of a scroll's meaning can take months or even years. Even then, there are no guarantees.": 1, "Normally, a period of servitude.": 1, "Normally, I'd send you to the Imperial City in Cyrodiil to seek answers at the Imperial Library, but that avenue no longer exists.": 1, "Normally, I would have welcomed someone like you -- resourceful, clearly no friend of the Empire.": 1, "Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you...": 1, "Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop.": 1, "Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.": 1, "Nords' armor has lots of fur. This sometimes makes M'aiq nervous.": 1, "Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim.": 1, "Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up.": 1, "Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.": 1, "Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day.": 1, "Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like Khajiit.": 1, "Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.": 1, "Nordic ruins. Even older than I am. I wonder if the draugr are as gullible as they were when I was a girl.": 1, "Normally, a quick death.": 1, "Nocturnal, guide my hand!": 1, "Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.": 1, "Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.": 1, "No. You can use the North Gate, or you can head to the next city.": 1, "No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.": 1, "No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now.": 1, "No. Wait... I recognize the name, but I'm not sure why.": 1, "No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?": 1, "No. This has to end here and now.": 1, "No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began.": 1, "No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.": 1, "No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago.": 1, "No. That won't be enough.": 1, "No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.": 1, "No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.": 1, "No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.": 1, "No. Talvas is his apprentice. I'm his steward. I manage the day to day affairs of Tel Mithryn.": 1, "No... But I belong to her.": 1, "No. She's such a nice woman. Comes by every day looking for jewelry for her family in Cyrodiil. Is it because she's a noble?": 1, "No. Only the Telvanni have the ability to weave living growth from the ash.": 1, "No. Oh, please no...": 1, "No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now.": 1, "No. Now shove off.": 1, "No. Not yet. We should greet our guest first.": 1, "No. Not yet. I have watched your progress through my realm with growing interest.": 1, "No. Not yet. After all, a dragon... something out of old tales and legends... no one could have expected that.": 1, "No. Not really.": 1, "No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.": 1, "No. Not like this.": 1, "No. Nor is there any among you fit to serve. For a band in the wilderness, it is better to have no leader than a poor one. ": 1, "No. No, I'm quite sure I have no idea what you're talking about.": 1, "No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?": 1, "No. No I can't.": 1, "No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own.": 1, "No... I am still too weak to face him. It will take all my strength if I am to force him to hold to his bargain.": 1, "No... I was trying to...": 1, "No... I won't let you ruin centuries of preparations...": 1, "Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms.": 1, "Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.": 1, "Nobody's ever asked me that before. I... I don't know.": 1, "Nobody seems certain why it happened... an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of their people or perhaps both.": 1, "Nobody really knows.": 1, "Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him.": 1, "Nobody ever expects a fireball from the darkened corner.": 1, "Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know.": 1, "Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!": 1, "No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it.": 1, "No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold.": 1, "No? Well, I've given it a bit of thought.": 1, "No? Very well, it's your choice.": 1, "No? So you don't know anything about my brother?": 1, "No? I daresay we don't have all day.": 1, "No?": 1, "No....": 1, "No... No! You must be the one who took my skooma!": 1, "No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us.": 1, "No... No, this cannot be...": 1, "No... Serana... your own father....": 1, "No... all these wasted months, or has it been years? I don't even remember how much time has passed.": 1, "No... he is too strong...": 1, "Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn. ": 1, "No... it's not working!": 1, "No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden.": 1, "No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim.": 1, "No... not by a mortal...": 1, "No... not like this.": 1, "No... not like this...": 1, "No... why?": 1, "No... my blood is strong...": 1, "No. Look around you. You have done nothing here on your own.": 1, "Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!": 1, "Not as much as I would like. Even after spending decades of my life in study of the Elder Scrolls, they remain a great mystery to me.": 1, "Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.": 1, "Not on your life! I'd sooner try to swim back to Windhelm.": 1, "Not often, no.": 1, "Not now. Wait until we are back at Tel Mithryn.": 1, "Not now. Stay alert.": 1, "Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.": 1, "Not now. I'm too upset to talk.": 1, "Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony.": 1, "Not now, please.": 1, "Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important.": 1, "Not now, lad. Karliah said it was important.": 1, "Not now, it's time for the ceremony.": 1, "Not now, I'm working.": 1, "Not now, I'm trying to watch this!": 1, "Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.": 1, "Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father.": 1, "Not my thing, but who am I to judge...": 1, "Not my problem. You want through here, you pay. Or else.": 1, "Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot.": 1, "Not my problem.": 1, "Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.": 1, "Not my concern, no sera.": 1, "Not much. One moment I was buying a necklace, and the rest is just a blur.": 1, "Not much. If you read any history, it shows up from time to time, but it's a hard thing to track.": 1, "Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.": 1, "Not much. But I hope you like them!": 1, "Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested.": 1, "Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult.": 1, "Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.": 1, "Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone.": 1, "Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.": 1, "Not much of a farm. How do they expect to grow anything in this ash-free soil?": 1, "Not only that, but Auriel's Bow is in safe hands.": 1, "Not quite, though I can see how an outsider might arrive at that conclusion.": 1, "Not that it helps us anyway, because they're all half a continent away in Cyrodiil.": 1, "Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.": 1, "Not that I'd know anything about it, of course, but it seems to me that the last thing a thieves' guild would want is to draw attention to itself.": 1, "Not that I'd ever get involved in any of those kinds of things, of course.": 1, "Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree.": 1, "Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still...": 1, "Not that I ever saw.": 1, "Not that I actually want to see one, understand. I hope that dragon stays far away from here.": 1, "Not sure. I was told it's an old Imperial farm that was wiped out by the eruption of the Red Mountain.": 1, "Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency.": 1, "Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.": 1, "Not sure you should be walking around naked.": 1, "Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know.": 1, "Not sure what you're waiting for... step into the light.": 1, "Not quite good enough, are you?": 1, "Not sure how much longer I can hold out here.": 1, "Not so sure of yourself after all? ": 1, "Not so much with, as for.": 1, "Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed.": 1, "Not so fast Elf!": 1, "Not scared of an old woman now, are you?": 1, "Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.": 1, "Not right now. Anything new?": 1, "Not right now.": 1, "Not recently. Neloth keeps me very busy with spell research.": 1, "Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think.": 1, "Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen. ": 1, "Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.": 1, "Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try.": 1, "Not ready? Well, my arrogant little sibling, until you pay the fine the Dark Brotherhood holds nothing for you. No contracts. No rewards. No respect.": 1, "Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh?": 1, "Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole place. Mass confusion.": 1, "Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.": 1, "Not much contact with others around here. Got the Skaal Village to the north, but the Nords there keep to themselves.": 1, "Not for us, it isn't.": 1, "Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.": 1, "Not fond of vampires, are they?": 1, "Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.": 1, "Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.": 1, "Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here.": 1, "Not everything is as happy as you do.": 1, "Not everything is as dire as you make it out to be.": 1, "Not everyone's agreed to the Moot. ": 1, "Not everyone was built for this kind of life. There's no shame in that.": 1, "Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in.": 1, "Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms.": 1, "Not even the gods will show you mercy!": 1, "Not even for a look. ": 1, "Not from me you don't!": 1, "Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.": 1, "Not bad... but it won't save you.": 1, "Not bad. Not bad at all.": 1, "Not bad. Next time won't be so easy. ": 1, "Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?": 1, "Not bad for an amateur? Take this.": 1, "Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.": 1, "Not at this rate, no.": 1, "Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve.": 1, "Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.": 1, "Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.": 1, "Not at all. I used to fish the waters around Solstheim. Made a damn fine living at it, too.": 1, "Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand.": 1, "Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life.": 1, "Not as much.": 1, "Not certain who lived there... it was already a pile of rubble when I arrived in Raven Rock.": 1, "Not going to happen.": 1, "Not going to weigh in either way?": 1, "Not good enough.": 1, "Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear.": 1, "Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.": 1, "Not many people understand the appeal. You keep surprising me.": 1, "Not many people care, these days. The world is the worse for it.": 1, "Not many of those beauties left in the world... forging them is a lost art.": 1, "Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man.": 1, "Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...": 1, "Not long. They're hiding in the country side.": 1, "Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.": 1, "Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you.": 1, "Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.": 1, "Not like this...": 1, "Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.": 1, "Not lately. Why?": 1, "Not lately. Business has been slow.": 1, "Not just vampires. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim.": 1, "Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.": 1, "Not half as sorry as I am.": 1, "Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.": 1, "Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it.": 1, "Not here. Follow me.": 1, "Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched.": 1, "Not here. We will meet at Reachcliff Cave.": 1, "Not anymore. Thanks to you. Friend.": 1, "Not him again.": 1, "Not if I can help it!": 1, "Not if I get it first.": 1, "Not in our nature.": 1, "Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye.": 1, "Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.": 1, "Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.": 1, "Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?": 1, "No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff.": 1, "No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.": 1, "No. It's not. Trust me.": 1, "No, I'm not. Looks like we've got something in common, then.": 1, "No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy.": 1, "No, I'm not a rebel. You can't do this!": 1, "No, I'm not Arnleif. Yes, I know it's called Arnleif and Sons. ": 1, "No, I'm afraid not. But there is land if you want to buy it.": 1, "No, I'm afraid I don't know anything of the sort.": 1, "No, I'm a Redguard. My family hails from the Imperial Province. Ah, but I left home when I was just a lad. Been wandering ever since.": 1, "No, I'd rather be here. Free to hunt, free to live my life as I choose.": 1, "No, I want to take my time with it.": 1, "No, I think I have enough here to get started.": 1, "No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years.": 1, "No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time.": 1, "No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now.": 1, "No, I openly welcome the presence of armed strangers who have no reason to care about any of us.": 1, "No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties.": 1, "No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is.": 1, "No, I just think he's going about this the wrong way.": 1, "No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it.": 1, "No, I don't think that will be necessary.": 1, "No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that.": 1, "No, I don't think so. Not today.": 1, "No, I don't think so.": 1, "No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it. ": 1, "No, I don't need anything right now. Please stop asking.": 1, "No, I certainly didn't!": 1, "No, I am alive only because the vampires spared me.": 1, "No, Housecarl!": 1, "No, Gorm. I am simply telling you what I see.": 1, "No, Frostmoth mustn't fall...": 1, "No, Councilor. I'm afraid we're going to fall short once again.": 1, "No, I just... I thought perhaps...": 1, "No, Councilor. He's spoken to everyone in town... twice. If House Hlaalu has a spy in Raven Rock, he's hidden beyond our means to find him.": 1, "No, I'm sorry. But there is land, available to you for purchase.": 1, "No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before.": 1, "No, don't go!": 1, "No, don't bother. You're useless, as always. I'll get Ildene to do it.": 1, "No, dear sister. We do not.": 1, "No, damn you!": 1, "No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.": 1, "No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences.": 1, "No, but this one...": 1, "No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad.": 1, "No, but there's no way she would have left it in Tamriel.": 1, "No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric.": 1, "No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped.": 1, "No, but his housecarl sent us a letter. ": 1, "No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush.": 1, "No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush.": 1, "No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?": 1, "No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk.": 1, "No, and if you're smart you won't either. I know he's one of your kind and all, but he's only looking out for himself.": 1, "No, and before you ask, it's not for sale.": 1, "No, and at this rate, I never shall!": 1, "No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them.": 1, "No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against your kind, and I intend to win it.": 1, "No, and I'm not expecting any.": 1, "No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself.": 1, "No, Karita. I don't think I could.": 1, "No, Igmund. It's too dangerous.": 1, "No, I... Wait. Maybe. I don't know how I know that name...": 1, "No, I... I was just asking.": 1, "No, I... I submit. No more.": 1, "No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you.": 1, "No, I'm sure of that. And yet... I think I had a dream of a temple, and he was there.": 1, "No, but I have brought someone who has seen things...": 1, "No! You're wrong. You must be wrong. Laelette may have met her fate out in the marsh.": 1, "No! You'll never take me alive!": 1, "No! You will not deny me this!": 1, "No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.": 1, "No strange. Strong. You strong, make us stronger. Help tribe-kin.": 1, "No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here.": 1, "No shouting match between dragon and man, no fire or fury did this battle entail.  ": 1, "No shipments have come in.": 1, "No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done.": 1, "No quests to be undertaken. No villains to be slain. No challenges to face.": 1, "No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!": 1, "No politics, Thongvor. I told you before.": 1, "No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum.": 1, "No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.": 1, "No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?": 1, "No one will soon forget that you were the one to defeat Harkon.": 1, "No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.": 1, "No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.": 1, "No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.": 1, "No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.": 1, "No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman.": 1, "No one is going to stand in my way!": 1, "No one here does.": 1, "No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though.": 1, "No one escapes. I thought keeping Madanach down there would keep him under control.": 1, "No one escapes!": 1, "No one crosses me!": 1, "No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!": 1, "No one can take them away. No one!": 1, "No one can save you now!": 1, "No one bought any flowers again today. I... I don't know what to do.": 1, "No one bests an Orc!": 1, "No offense, of course.": 1, "No one knows really. Superstitious folk say they're the risen forms of those that died long ago, but I'm not so certain.": 1, "No time for idle chatter. Mercer is awaiting your presence.": 1, "No time to talk now, my friend. No time. Out mistress needs tending. Keeping.": 1, "No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!": 1, "No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!": 1, "No! Wait! We're not rebels!": 1, "No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up!  Don't lie to me J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to steal it from me!": 1, "No! The Eye is mine!": 1, "No! That's what I'm trying to say. The secrets. They're in there. In there deep. Can't get them out. They're in my head!": 1, "No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.": 1, "No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?": 1, "No! Oh, by the gods, please no!": 1, "No! Noooooooo!": 1, "No! Noooooo!": 1, "No! Linwe prefers stealing from the deceased. Digs up the corpses, breaks into the Hall of the Dead...": 1, "No! I...": 1, "No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.": 1, "No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!": 1, "No! I will not allow that happen. The Elder Scrolls only tell of events that might be, not events that will be.": 1, "No! I can't! It may be poison!": 1, "No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!": 1, "No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand.": 1, "No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...": 1, "No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.": 1, "No way. I'm quick!": 1, "No weapon is worth dying for, not even a weapon forged from Stalhrim.": 1, "No wonder the Dwemer were so interested in that book. It was indeed one that Miraak used to advance his power as Dragonborn.": 1, "No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!": 1, "No you aren't.": 1, "No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?": 1, "No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!": 1, "No! Do not touch the Stone while Miraak controls it!": 1, "No! Don't hurt me again!": 1, "No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!": 1, "No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...": 1, "No you're not. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?": 1, "No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame.": 1, "No, don't shake your fist. Wiggle the tentacle things where your eyes used to be.": 1, "No, haven't seen anyone.": 1, "No. But you need to come on the hunt more than we need you on the hunt.": 1, "No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. ": 1, "No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.": 1, "No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.": 1, "No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.": 1, "No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title.": 1, "No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.": 1, "No. ": 1, "No, you've proven your strength to him.": 1, "No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to stop him... to make everything right.": 1, "No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our way, not his.": 1, "No, you won't. But I'll love you anyway.": 1, "No, you must be mistaken. He made it exceedingly clear the last time we spoke that he had no interest in my help.": 1, "No, you don't...": 1, "No. Can't say there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.": 1, "No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!": 1, "No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to.": 1, "No, which is fine with me.": 1, "No, what you're looking for is a specific book. Presumably because Miraak's power derives from it.": 1, "No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it.": 1, "No, we are vampires, among the oldest and most powerful in Skyrim.": 1, "No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions.": 1, "No, this was different. He never trusted Florentius, always thought him to be trying to get attention.": 1, "No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.": 1, "No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.": 1, "No, they didn't. But that's why I like being out here with you.": 1, "No, there's another way. The question is, how much are you willing to risk to find Auriel's Bow?": 1, "No, that's pushing it too far. Very exciting but highly unlikely, I can't possibly write that in.": 1, "No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss.": 1, "No, sorry. It's 4,000 coins or no deal.": 1, "No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!": 1, "No, sorry. It isn't right.": 1, "No. Even Ranmir can only drink so much.": 1, "No. Gods no, not for years.": 1, "No. It's mine!": 1, "No. It'll have to run its course, and there's always the chance I may never recover.": 1, "No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have.": 1, "No. I'm telling you. There was no other reason.": 1, "No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad.": 1, "No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.": 1, "No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?": 1, "No. I'm not.": 1, "No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native. ": 1, "No. I'll tell you, Wilhelm, if I could sweep her away from here tomorrow I'd do it, but Klimmek still has so much to learn.": 1, "No. I wouldn't.": 1, "No. I will have no peace until these hunters are dead.": 1, "No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.": 1, "No. I was just getting some fresh air. Had one too many pints of mead at the Silver-Blood Inn.": 1, "No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim.": 1, "No. I was just buying jewelry for my sister in Cyrodiil. I've never even seen that man before.": 1, "No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what to do.": 1, "No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true daughter of Skyrim and'll know what to do.": 1, "No. I think if I was a young man, I would have done the same.": 1, "No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.": 1, "No. I mean it.": 1, "No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield.": 1, "No. I have my pride.": 1, "No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep.": 1, "No. I don't.": 1, "No. I don't have any idea. I was just shopping for a pendant for my sister back in the Imperial City.": 1, "No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.": 1, "No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.": 1, "No. He isn't.": 1, "No. He has to die. We have no choice.": 1, "No. I try to avoid it. Always seems to end in an argument. You?": 1, "No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option...": 1, "No, sire. I have not.": 1, "No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you.": 1, "No, no, no. This isn't just your run-of-the-mill pickaxe... I'm talking about an Ancient Nordic Pickaxe.": 1, "No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!": 1, "No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work.": 1, "No, no, my wounds are not serious. I don't think the elves were trying to harm me. Perhaps they intended to frighten me.": 1, "No, no, I couldn't. ...You open it.": 1, "No, no! This is the wrong way!": 1, "No, no! This can't be happening!": 1, "No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please.": 1, "No, no no no. This can't be happening.": 1, "No, no more!": 1, "No, no girl. It's the pickled spider tongue and then the decayed taproot. Do it the other way, and your cure turns into a poison.": 1, "No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead.": 1, "No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well.": 1, "No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.": 1, "No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation.": 1, "No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way.": 1, "No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior.": 1, "No, just... ": 1, "No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white. ": 1, "No, just check in the guests and manage the coin and keep a roof over your head. No, nothing important.": 1, "No, it... it can't be.": 1, "No, it.. it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades.": 1, "No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!": 1, "No, it's probably not.": 1, "No, it's not my time...": 1, "No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around. ": 1, "No, it's fine. I don't mind being poor. ": 1, "No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect.": 1, "No, it cannot be...": 1, "No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea.": 1, "No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned.": 1, "No, no, nothing like that. He doesn't need to battle us to know us. He's always watched over Thirsk, and sees us from beyond.": 1, "No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you.": 1, "No, no, that won't do. Can't have you forgo bathing... The ashlands can leave one a bit pungent and it's, eh, obvious you've been through them.": 1, "No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything.": 1, "No, please! I don't want to die!": 1, "No, please! I don't understand...": 1, "No, only one option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish Malyn's soul there.": 1, "No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of.": 1, "No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way.": 1, "No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet.": 1, "No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war.": 1, "No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary.": 1, "No, not that it's any of your business.": 1, "No, not right now. Maybe later, if I'm still upset.": 1, "No, not recently at least.": 1, "No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here.": 1, "No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows.": 1, "No, not at all. It's just...": 1, "No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you.": 1, "No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance.": 1, "No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now.": 1, "No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.": 1, "No, no, you must get away! If I'm seen talking to you, they'll blame me!": 1, "No, no. Goodness, no!": 1, "No, no. I'm fine. Is there something you need?": 1, "No, no. I'm just a simple herbalist. You'll want to see Arcadia, over in Whiterun.": 1, "No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it.": 1, "No, no. Just watch over him.": 1, "No, no. Mostly, I'm just a simple herbalist. Lami over in Morthal should be able to help you.": 1, "No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth.": 1, "No, no. Well, I don't think so.": 1, "No, no. You just stay here and rest.": 1, "No, no. You must speak with Lord Harkon, not me!": 1, "No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen...": 1, "No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now.": 1, "My dear chieftain, I will bring you back a whole bouquet if you wish.": 1, "My dear boy, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?": 1, "My dear Salonia, how are you?": 1, "Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way.": 1, "Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us.": 1, "Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable.": 1, "Madanach. The King in Rags.": 1, "Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.": 1, "Madanach! Think you can escape my prison do you? You'll pay for what you've done to my family!": 1, "Madanach has been found to be the true murderer of Markarth. On behalf the city, I apologize for your wrongful imprisonment.": 1, "Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies.": 1, "Madame Ambassador, you know that I would never have behaved... that is to say... well I swear I'm innocent this time!": 1, "Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...": 1, "Maar saraan ko Sovngarde.": 1, "Maa.....": 1, "Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time.": 1, "M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said.": 1, "Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?": 1, "M'aiq wishes you well. ": 1, "M'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures. ": 1, "M'aiq once walked to High Hrothgar. So many steps, he lost count. ": 1, "M'aiq loves the people of Skyrim. Many interesting things they say to each other. ": 1, "M'aiq knows why Falmer are blind. It has nothing to do with the Dwemer disappearing. Really.": 1, "M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not. ": 1, "M'aiq knows many things, no?": 1, "M'aiq is very practical. He has no need for mysticism.": 1, "M'aiq is tired now. Go bother somebody else.": 1, "M'aiq is done talking.": 1, "M'aiq is always in search of calipers, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?": 1, "M'aiq hears many stories of war... yet few of them are true.": 1, "M'aiq has heard the people of Skyrim are better looking than the ones in Cyrodiil. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.": 1, "M'aiq has heard it is dangerous to be your friend.": 1, "M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.": 1, "M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.": 1, "M'aiq does not remember his childhood. Perhaps he never had one.": 1, "Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?": 1, "Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row.": 1, "Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...": 1, "Make it seem you are a member of the Dawnguard, thus sowing confusion among the herd. Wear this armor and plant this note on the victim.": 1, "Make it quick. I won't be here much longer.": 1, "Make it quick, then. I don't want your stink driving my customers away.": 1, "Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you.": 1, "Make it quick, I don't like this waiting game.": 1, "Make it count. This may be the only chance we ever get to use the Forge.": 1, "Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines. ": 1, "Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead.": 1, "Make Laelette go away!": 1, "Make 'em bleed.": 1, "Majni offered to help me reclaim my territory. I hunt with him until then. After that... we'll see.": 1, "Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.": 1, "Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there.": 1, "Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!": 1, "Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.": 1, "Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments.": 1, "Magic. Great.": 1, "Magic. Foul magic...": 1, "Magic! I'm not sure I approve.": 1, "Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them.": 1, "Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it.": 1, "Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races.": 1, "Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you.": 1, "Magic is for the weak. Pick up some steel if you want to fight me.": 1, "Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place.": 1, "Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians.": 1, "Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.": 1, "Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.": 1, "Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.": 1, "Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold.": 1, "M'aiq carries two weapons, to be safe. What if one breaks? That would be most unlucky.": 1, "M'aiq can travel fast across the land. Some lazy types take carriages. It is all the same to M'aiq.": 1, "Lyin' to my face isn't gonna win you any favors with me, I can promise you that.": 1, "Lord Harkon will finally have his wish... to see the prophecy fulfilled. Then we will all benefit.": 1, "Lord Harkon has searched for his daughter for so long. He must be very grateful.": 1, "Lord Harkon has never cared to use the Chalice, relying on his more than adequate powers until now.": 1, "Loose ends and all that.": 1, "Looks to be another cold day.": 1, "Looks safe now. Let's move.": 1, "Looks like you've already have someone with you. If you want me to come along, you'll have to ask them to leave.": 1, "Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.": 1, "Looks like you weren't followed. Good.": 1, "Looks like you know your daedra.": 1, "Looks like you had no trouble.": 1, "Looks like we've got ourselves another fool.": 1, "Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon? The bringers of the End Times?": 1, "Looks like we're the only ones who made it.": 1, "Lord Harkon's a great man. Best show him the proper respect.": 1, "Looks like we're on the right track.": 1, "Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.": 1, "Looks like we'll need those bridges down in order to get the pumps in here working.": 1, "Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either.": 1, "Looks like they're better at making traps than they are at making bridges.": 1, "Looks like these Falmer are here to stay.": 1, "Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out.": 1, "Looks like the boss is at it again.": 1, "Looks like that's it. Got to go.": 1, "Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.": 1, "Looks like it's my lucky day.": 1, "Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.": 1, "Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should stick around to see if he comes back.": 1, "Looks like I chose the right person for the job.": 1, "Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out.": 1, "Looks like we're on our own now.": 1, "Lord Harkon's orders, Orthjolf. Calm yourself.": 1, "Lord Harkon, defeated. I never imagined I'd see the day.": 1, "Lord Harkon. Remember your place.": 1, "Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?": 1, "Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted.": 1, "Lucky for us it attacked when it did, eh? I wasn't looking forward to getting a shave from the Imperial headsman.": 1, "Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.": 1, "Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use.": 1, "Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it.": 1, "Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though.": 1, "Luck? Luck will play no part today. We will earn our victory or return to the All-Maker.": 1, "Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.": 1, "Luck won't help. I need something to pry these things out of my head.": 1, "Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking.": 1, "Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers.": 1, "Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader.": 1, "Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.": 1, "Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything.": 1, "Lucan found the claw about a year after he opened the store. He never quite explained where he got it. He's a tricky one.": 1, "Loyal? Thongvor supports Ulfric and his Stormcloaks! We should imprison the entire family as a precaution.": 1, "Lord of Seasons, I pray to you now that you might watch over the dead with mercy and kindness.": 1, "Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.": 1, "Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's see what it does.": 1, "Lorkhan's eyes, you're an ugly one, aren't you?": 1, "Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!": 1, "Lost it? Well, at least you showed signs of initiative by telling me.": 1, "Make love like a sabercat or crush your enemies to dust like a giant! Only a mere 20 gold coins and all this could be yours!": 1, "Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things....": 1, "Lost, stranger?": 1, "Lost...": 1, "Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.": 1, "Lots of theories. Some say they feed on them like I feed on blood.": 1, "Lowering the water level is the next logical step here.": 1, "Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.": 1, "Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you.": 1, "Looking to stay alive? Why take a chance?": 1, "Make sure that he is.": 1, "Make sure that you save some wood from the pile.": 1, "Mark my words. Raven Rock isn't finished yet.": 1, "Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.": 1, "Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses.": 1, "Mark my words, I'll be Jarl again someday!": 1, "Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again.": 1, "Margret. He... he killed her. Right in front of me.": 1, "Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!": 1, "Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?": 1, "Mara, I forgot how late it was. We'll need to lock up the shop.": 1, "Mara, I forgot how late it was. Need to lock up the shop.": 1, "Mara's mercy, then he's safe! Come on, we have a lot to discuss.": 1, "Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!": 1, "Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding. ": 1, "Mara will always accept into her arms should you seek return to her fold.": 1, "Mark my words. Thonar Silver-Blood was behind that attack in the market. Somehow.": 1, "Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?": 1, "Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men.": 1, "Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost.": 1, "Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.": 1, "Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.": 1, "Mara can't help me. No one can.": 1, "Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.": 1, "Many years ago I lost my blade, \"Grimsever,\" within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth.": 1, "Many used to come to these caves. The forgotten. The wretched.": 1, "Many thanks. Here - a token of gratitude.": 1, "Many thanks. And please, take this gift. I hope it's a fitting token to honor the deed.": 1, "Many thanks.": 1, "Many scholars and loremasters have been ensnared by the lure of learning the secrets that only Hermaeus Mora possesses.": 1, "Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here. ": 1, "Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons.": 1, "Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.": 1, "Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen... rightness of my Thu'um.": 1, "Mark my words... the East Empire Company will return to Raven Rock, and when they do, I'll be at the top of their list.": 1, "Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever.": 1, "Master, I...": 1, "Master, I have done as you asked and traveled here.": 1, "Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot.": 1, "Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to...": 1, "Master Neloth, the silt strider traders just dropped off some supplies.": 1, "Master Neloth, I'm preparing for a trip to Raven Rock to pick up supplies.": 1, "Master Neloth's old apprentice? The one before me?": 1, "Master Neloth! What have you done to him?": 1, "Master Neloth! What have you done to her?": 1, "Master Neloth told me to practice this spell while he's away.": 1, "Master Neloth refused to teach me the Ash Guardian spell. So I read his spell book on my own and learned it.": 1, "Master Neloth knows what I'm doing.": 1, "Master Neloth is the most powerful wizard of House Telvanni. Maybe the most powerful in all of Morrowind.": 1, "Master Neloth is preparing to... well, it's better if you don't know.": 1, "Markarth and the Reach are our lands. That is why we are the Forsworn. We cannot claim the home that is rightly ours.": 1, "Master Neloth is one of the oldest and most respected members of House Telvanni.": 1, "Master Neloth is going to be casting some rather loud spells in the next day or two.": 1, "Master Neloth has tasked Elynea with repairing the tower.": 1, "Master Neloth grew one here to be his home. Don't ask me how.": 1, "Master Neloth believes they may be fragments from inside Red Mountain that were flung here during the huge eruption two hundred years ago.": 1, "Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.": 1, "Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him.": 1, "Marvelous.": 1, "Marriage is a fine institution, however, one that does present certain difficulties for such as like ourselves.": 1, "Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!": 1, "Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?": 1, "Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.": 1, "Markarth is not without its problems, but the Empire is here to maintain order.": 1, "Markarth is my city. You have no right looking into my business. Now get out.": 1, "Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death.": 1, "Master Neloth is going to kill me. Assuming he doesn't make me into a test subject again.": 1, "Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom.": 1, "Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.": 1, "Many in the court don't bother with potions, but I keep things stocked just in case.": 1, "Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!": 1, "Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!": 1, "Malacath has given me a vision of a glorious death. I am to wait here until it finds me.": 1, "Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.": 1, "Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.": 1, "Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.": 1, "Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful.": 1, "Making sure those shipments of ebony make it safely from the mine to the shipping docks is my new order of the day.": 1, "Makes everything else worth it.": 1, "Makes Narfi very, very sad. Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye.": 1, "Maker... it can't be. Serana?!": 1, "Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.": 1, "Make yourself at home, please. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.": 1, "Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault.": 1, "Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak.": 1, "Make your preparations. When you are ready, come find me at my last vigil.": 1, "Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe... and admire.": 1, "Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us.": 1, "Make way.": 1, "Make use of my coffin whenever you like. My home is your home.": 1, "Make up your mind already.": 1, "Make them stop? Oh no, certainly not. At least not yet.": 1, "Make them all pay for what they've done to me...": 1, "Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.": 1, "Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.": 1, "Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us.": 1, "Make sure to recommend us to your associates.": 1, "Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.": 1, "Make sure to get yourself something to drink.": 1, "Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday. ": 1, "Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard.": 1, "Malacath preserve you.": 1, "Malacath protect you.": 1, "Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.": 1, "Many hunters pass through our village, and sometimes the Dark Elves of Raven Rock visit us.": 1, "Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.": 1, "Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe.": 1, "Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these.": 1, "Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom.": 1, "Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world.": 1, "Many I fear still need convincing.": 1, "Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.": 1, "Man gives bards a bad name.": 1, "Mammoth-nose!": 1, "Mama...": 1, "Mama, why are you and papa fighting?": 1, "Mama, where did papa go?": 1, "Mama, when is Cade coming home?": 1, "Mama, when can we go play in the river again?": 1, "Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?": 1, "Mama said I could help with the goats!": 1, "Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.": 1, "Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.": 1, "Mallory is an expert \"obtainer of goods.\" We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?": 1, "Mallory is an expert \"obtainer of goods.\" We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?": 1, "Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day.": 1, "Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.": 1, "Make sure that she is.": 1, "Malur, I need you to take care of something.": 1, "Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.": 1, "Malyn's soul is beyond hope because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end.": 1, "Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else.": 1, "Mama died, and now I'm... I'm all alone...": 1, "Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear.": 1, "Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.": 1, "Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.": 1, "Master, arise!": 1, "Looking to practice, stranger?": 1, "Looking to blow yourself up? I hear that's what magic does to you. There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic, unless that blew up too.": 1, "Long story, but I don't see the harm in sharing it with you.": 1, "Long live the Empire.": 1, "Long live the Empire!": 1, "Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!": 1, "Long live the Arch-Mage!": 1, "Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon.": 1, "Long enough.": 1, "Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens.": 1, "Long as I stay out of the way, the guards don't seem to care about me being here.": 1, "Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex.": 1, "Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind.": 1, "Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me.": 1, "Lone travelers can find these woods a little treacherous.": 1, "Lokir of Rorikstead.": 1, "Longer than I would have liked. ": 1, "Lok, Thu'um.": 1, "Locked? Are you certain, Elder?": 1, "Locked. Damn! One of the hags nearby will have the key. You'll have to take it from here. I'll keep watch here - unless you can pick the lock.": 1, "Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.": 1, "Lock the city gate.": 1, "Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have.": 1, "Load up, and we'll get underway.": 1, "Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around.": 1, "Living here, I have access to magic I couldn't possibly imagine before.": 1, "Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life.": 1, "Live long. Fight well.": 1, "Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes.": 1, "Live for thousands of years!": 1, "Live a life worth telling about.": 1, "Little patience for talk? Good. Let's end this!": 1, "Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here.": 1, "Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?": 1, "Look along the east coast. The boat will be there.": 1, "Look around for the missing crests. Even in this mess, they should stick out.": 1, "Look at them... they've definitely taken a liking to you.": 1, "Look at the young ones scrap!": 1, "Look at the sky... the Divines must be angry with us!": 1, "Look at the sky. What kind of a place is this?": 1, "Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.": 1, "Look at the size of that fort. They must have room for a few more in there.": 1, "Look at the device here - the gear in the center is just about the right size. Try putting the shards in and... we'll see what happens.": 1, "Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.": 1, "Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.": 1, "Look at that.": 1, "Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?": 1, "Look at that!": 1, "Look at that fool.": 1, "Look at that edge. Still sharp.": 1, "Look around all you want, but don't try anything funny.": 1, "Look at me, I'm a different person. And I have you to thank for it.": 1, "Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you.": 1, "Look at him, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what he's lost... besides his mind.": 1, "Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor.": 1, "Look at her, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what she's lost... besides her mind.": 1, "Look at all this. She must have spent years collecting these components.": 1, "Look around. Grab anything useful.": 1, "Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.": 1, "Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything.": 1, "Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.": 1, "Look around you. There are some extremely powerful undead here.": 1, "Look around you. The Flagon, the Guild... it's all fallin' apart.": 1, "Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.": 1, "Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true.": 1, "Look around here. There's not much left.": 1, "Look at me when I'm talking to you, eh?": 1, "Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room.": 1, "Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.": 1, "Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider.": 1, "Like to see him laugh his way out that.": 1, "Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now.": 1, "Like the best of friends. I would never hesitate to share anything with her.": 1, "Like that they were supposed to guard some vampire here, but wound up all becoming vampires themselves when they saw how powerful he was.": 1, "Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?": 1, "Like she didn't want to just stop my father... she wanted to stick it to him, too.": 1, "Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction.": 1, "Like myself, Serana was a human once. We were devout followers of Lord Molag Bal.": 1, "Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own.": 1, "Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages.": 1, "Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it.": 1, "Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter. ": 1, "Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess.": 1, "Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for the prince of knowledge and fate.": 1, "Like what?": 1, "Like a stone.": 1, "Like Serana, I am a Daughter of Coldharbour, an vampire offspring of Molag Bal.": 1, "Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her.": 1, "Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.": 1, "Like I said. Hagraven.": 1, "Like I said, we were never very close. Not a lot of father-daughter bonding if you know what I mean.": 1, "Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him.": 1, "Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now.": 1, "Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can.": 1, "Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn.": 1, "Light, medium, or heavy?": 1, "Light take you!": 1, "Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?": 1, "Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.": 1, "Life should never be taken without reason.": 1, "Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?": 1, "Like you won't do different?": 1, "Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod.": 1, "Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her.": 1, "Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.": 1, "Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.": 1, "Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?": 1, "Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero.": 1, "Listener! Fancy seeing you out here.": 1, "Listener!": 1, "Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you.": 1, "Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!": 1, "Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!": 1, "Listen, we're friends, right?": 1, "Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.": 1, "Listen, lass. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.": 1, "Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.": 1, "Listen, lad. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.": 1, "Listen, father. I've been thinking....": 1, "Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him.": 1, "Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon.": 1, "Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?": 1, "Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful.": 1, "Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.": 1, "Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return.": 1, "Listen to me and you might learn something.": 1, "Listen to me!": 1, "Look at these figures, Thongvor! Ore yield is down by half, and the amount of silver bars being smelted is slipping even more than that.": 1, "Listen to this one! \"My nights have been impossible to bear without you.\"": 1, "Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.": 1, "Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are.": 1, "Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.": 1, "Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl.": 1, "Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here.": 1, "Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis.": 1, "Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!": 1, "Looking to hire a boat?": 1, "Look at these fools, so concerned with tending their precious \"beacon.\"": 1, "Look at this one. Spoiled as a child, I'll bet. Allowed to leave trash just lying around...": 1, "Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story.": 1, "Look, this is important... even more important than wiping out the ash spawn.": 1, "Look, this can be a slow business. Digging takes time. Come around later, and I'll have something more interesting to show.": 1, "Look, there's a chest in there. Door's sealed tight, though...": 1, "Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste.": 1, "Look, the East Empire Company didn't give me a choice. They've raised their prices again, and there's nothing I can do about it.": 1, "Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society.": 1, "Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers.": 1, "Look, take whatever you want. I'm getting out of here!": 1, "Look, on the edge here. This has been cut, precisely cut. If you had another piece, about the same size, it would... it would snap right in.": 1, "Look, my wife nags that I'm too old to go traipsing around these mines chasing my story.": 1, "Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me.": 1, "Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while.": 1, "Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since.": 1, "Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.": 1, "Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-": 1, "Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga.": 1, "Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber.": 1, "Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence.": 1, "Look, if you see Crescius, tell him to give me that pickaxe back and I'll pay you for the trouble.": 1, "Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here.": 1, "Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!": 1, "Look, here. In the third panel.": 1, "Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim.": 1, "Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims.": 1, "Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them.": 1, "Look, don't waste my time. Come back when you're ready to discuss this for real.": 1, "Look, did you want the information or not?": 1, "Look, come back tomorrow, okay? If I have anything left that's not sold or spoiled, you can have it.": 1, "Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing.": 1, "Look, in case you hadn't noticed, these aren't the glory days of the Guild.": 1, "Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble.": 1, "Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want.": 1, "Look, um... Thanks. And I'm sorry for my unneighborly reaction. If you talk to Cicero, you be sure and tell him I'll be down to help soon.": 1, "Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar.": 1, "Looking for something to lend a hand with? We have problems aplenty in Raven Rock.": 1, "Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?": 1, "Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.": 1, "Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.": 1, "Looking for any potions? Ingredients? Alchemical supplies?": 1, "Looking for a place to stay?": 1, "Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund.": 1, "Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase.": 1, "Looking at the equipment and materials, it looks like she was trying to advance her necromancy.": 1, "Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.": 1, "Lookin' forward to it.": 1, "Look... You shouldn't be doing that...": 1, "Look... Now's not a good time...": 1, "Look, this whole blood ritual is a bit personal. I'd rather not have a bigger audience than I need to.": 1, "Look. You're making my customers nervous. Put the weapon away.": 1, "Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?": 1, "Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?": 1, "Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.": 1, "Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But... ": 1, "Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me.": 1, "Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true.": 1, "Look, you're great. Really. But I just don't think that's for us.": 1, "Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold.": 1, "Look, you must have me confused with someone else.": 1, "Look, what is it you want from me?": 1, "Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation.": 1, "Look, we've been over this. I paid you off, I don't owe you a thing.": 1, "Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left.": 1, "Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me.": 1, "Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out.": 1, "Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem.": 1, "Look, I... I...": 1, "Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!": 1, "Look, \"dearest\", what I do on my own time is my business. You stick to your business and we'll both be fine.": 1, "Look! Look!": 1, "Look what's happened to us so far under his watchful eye. He gave his blessing to all the leaders who brought us to this point.": 1, "Look what you've made me do!": 1, "Look up there. I think I see something.": 1, "Look to the cities. Speak to innkeepers, carriage drivers, anyone who would meet a traveler.": 1, "Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.": 1, "Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.": 1, "Look out! The wolf is loose!": 1, "Look out! The prisoners are loose!": 1, "Look out for that Steam Centurion! Get to higher ground!": 1, "Look into my eyes, Serana. You tell me what I am.": 1, "Look how you sniffed out my little scheme at the North Gate. You knew it was a shakedown and you called him on it. That's what I'm talking about.": 1, "Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil.": 1, "Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble.": 1, "Look for yourself.": 1, "Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.": 1, "Look at you. Mortal. Weak.": 1, "Look at you, wandering around causing trouble. Precious.": 1, "Look at you, up to no good.": 1, "Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade.": 1, "Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be long before you'll be joining the fight yourself.": 1, "Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?": 1, "Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?": 1, "Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.": 1, "Look at this. I should've known it was only a matter of time before they found us.": 1, "Look at this place. This has to be it!": 1, "Look at this place. No one's been here in centuries.": 1, "Look at this place. I can't imagine choosing to come here. My mother must have been terrified.": 1, "Look at this place. Do you think anything would want to live here?": 1, "Look for a way out! We are not going to burn to death in our own damned Sanctuary!": 1, "Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back.": 1, "Look, I appreciate your company, but that's not why you're here. You're the money in this operation. And I guess some of the muscle.": 1, "Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!": 1, "Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul.": 1, "Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short.": 1, "Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by.": 1, "Look, I've just gotten myself out of quite a mess here, in case you haven't noticed, and while I appreciate your help, I...": 1, "Look, I've got training to get to.": 1, "Look, I've been in this business a long time and I've seen all types. You can play it tough, you can play it smart... whatever.": 1, "Look, I'm sorry about your troubles, but I've got to look out for myself. I'm not going to risk it.": 1, "Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business.": 1, "Look, I'm just here to keep watch. What you're looking for is down inside.": 1, "Look, I'm happy to help you run any errands you need to, but I've got my own destination. Could you help me get there whenever we're done?": 1, "Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech.": 1, "Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way.": 1, "Look, I'm busy. Please go bother somebody else.": 1, "Look, I'll make this simple for you.": 1, "Look, I'll be honest with you. I have no idea. But I'm sure we can find something worth your time.": 1, "Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore.": 1, "Look, I want you to have this. I know it isn't much, but it's important to me.": 1, "Look, I care about you. A lot. And I'll come with you wherever you want to go.": 1, "Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father.": 1, "Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane.": 1, "Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!": 1, "Look, I don't want to get in another brawl with you.": 1, "Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!": 1, "Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt.": 1, "Look, I know I don't have much to go on. I have that unsent letter, and that's really it.": 1, "Look, I know why you're here. I'll get the coin, I promise.": 1, "Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down.": 1, "Look, I loved my father, but when he found that prophecy... that became his life. Everything else, even me and my mother... we just became clutter.": 1, "Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?": 1, "Look, I never needed treasure. My father owns land; our family is wealthy. I just wanted adventure. Not this.": 1, "Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now.": 1, "Look, I know the others think I'm a bit daft for sayin' stuff like this, but I'm gonna give it to you straight.": 1, "Master, guide my hand!": 1, "Master, look. It's the Phial.": 1, "Master, you promised to teach me a new conjuration spell.": 1, "Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.": 1, "Most exiled dark elves call Vvardenfell their home. I call Raven Rock our home... may it last a thousand years.": 1, "Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one.": 1, "Most certainly. The translation was \"Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been.\"": 1, "Morwen, you say? Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Left to join her mother's people on Solstheim, as I recall.": 1, "Morvayn's reign is over!": 1, "Morvath will taste your blood!": 1, "Morthal will be mine to govern someday. I have a great deal to learn.": 1, "Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.": 1, "Morthal has enough problems as it is!": 1, "Mortals aren't allowed to freely roam the castle. Not even you.": 1, "Mortal? Insufferable.": 1, "Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness.": 1, "Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me.": 1, "Most hail from House Redoran, but there are a few from other houses.": 1, "Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days.": 1, "More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target.": 1, "More tea, Pelly my dear?": 1, "More spiders? I liked the ones back home better.": 1, "More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested.": 1, "More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.": 1, "More of these things?": 1, "More of the dragon-tongue. The runes have faded a bit, but I believe I can translate the inscription.": 1, "More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians.": 1, "More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically.": 1, "More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure.": 1, "More cups and plates for me to carry?": 1, "More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone.": 1, "More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.": 1, "Moooong cha!": 1, "More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?": 1, "Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin.": 1, "Most here are up to something, of course, but in his case, it's not good.": 1, "Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil.": 1, "Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.": 1, "Mother worries when I walk too far from the village. She says a dragon might snatch me up, but I'm not afraid.": 1, "Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.": 1, "Mother used to get so worried when I walked too far from the village.": 1, "Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.": 1, "Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.": 1, "Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...": 1, "Mostly things from the village or the land around it. Have a look.": 1, "Mostly staffs. They're my specialty.": 1, "Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities.": 1, "Mostly for transporting goods and people. They were pretty commonplace in Morrowind, but that was ages ago.": 1, "Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time.": 1, "Mostly books. There were a couple of soul gems, some ingredients for Elynea, and some strange wood.": 1, "Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise.": 1, "Most of my contacts live leagues away from Solstheim.": 1, "Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.": 1, "Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.": 1, "Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.": 1, "Most of those don't happen very often.": 1, "Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip.": 1, "Most of the old brew is still good, but I had to get rid of some of the newer batches.": 1, "Most of the guards in Dawnstar carry swords forged from his very smithy.": 1, "Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.": 1, "Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three.": 1, "Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.": 1, "Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is.": 1, "Most of our learning could be found there. We always studied our enemies, so we might better learn how to defeat them.": 1, "Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.": 1, "Most of my friends are buried here.": 1, "Most scholars believe that the Nords of old used these implements to prepare their dead for burial.": 1, "Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.": 1, "Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad.": 1, "Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!": 1, "Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think.": 1, "Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement.": 1, "Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not.": 1, "Miraak? The one all the townsfolk are always chanting about?": 1, "Miraak? The name sounds familiar... Or does it? I can't remember.": 1, "Miraak... Miraak... It sounds familiar, and yet I can't quite place...": 1, "Miraak... It sounds very familiar. Not someone here, but... I'm not sure I can recall.": 1, "Miraak... I... I'm not sure that I do.": 1, "Miraak... I'm sure I've heard that name before. Haven't I? Was it in a dream?": 1, "Miraak's influence has vanished from Solstheim. So I assumed you had handled things. Why, did something interesting happen?": 1, "Miraak's been dead for thousands of years.": 1, "Miraak was trying to take power here, and protect himself in the process.": 1, "Miraak served me well, and was rewarded. I can grant you the same power as he wields, but all knowledge has its price.": 1, "Miraak is behind what is happening to our village, and so the knowledge he has gained as Dragonborn is at the heart of it.": 1, "Mirabelle will be waiting for you.": 1, "Miraak help me!": 1, "Miraak has forced me to serve him for too long. Nahkriin saraan lingrah. Let us destroy him together.": 1, "Miraak has commanded your death. So it shall be.": 1, "Miraak harbored fantasies of rebellion against me. Learn from his example. Serve me faithfully, and you will continue to be richly rewarded.": 1, "Miraak had this? This does not look like something of the Dragon cult.": 1, "Minutes? Hours? Years? I can't even begin to guess. I suggest we don't wait around to find out.": 1, "Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else.": 1, "Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.": 1, "Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines.": 1, "Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine.": 1, "Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.": 1, "Mining gear? No. However, I used to sell East Empire Pendants until I ran out of them. Popular little item.": 1, "Mining accident, back when I was in prison for being a pickpocket.": 1, "Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment...": 1, "Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here.": 1, "Miraak has you, just like the others!": 1, "Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important.": 1, "Miserable... just miserable. I hate this place.": 1, "Misery? I'll give you misery. Try getting assigned to scrape netch scum off the front of the Bulwark.": 1, "Molag Bal is a powerful daedric lord, and his will is made reality. ": 1, "Molag Bal curse you!": 1, "Mogrul... I got those special poisons you asked for.": 1, "Mogrul, I thought I told you I didn't want you hanging around here.": 1, "Mogrul says pay up. We figure we can just take it off your corpse.": 1, "Mogrul isn't someone you can ignore.": 1, "Mogrul doesn't lend coin to outlanders. Look somewhere else.": 1, "Modyn Veleth, Captain of the Redoran Guard at your service.": 1, "Modest as well as brave. Most admirable! I can see why the Skaal think highly of you.": 1, "Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force.": 1, "Mmmhmm? I've been working with you for over 10 years, and all you have to say is \"mmmhmm\"?": 1, "Mmm. That felt nice.": 1, "Mmm. Always a pleasure to watch when a man like you walks by.": 1, "Mmm-hmm...": 1, "Mmm, yes... Brelas, is that the one? I hope you're not thinking of cutting me out, are you? Haha.": 1, "Mmm, sorry. I really can't risk it. I'm sure you can find someone else with a little less dignity.": 1, "Mmm hmm.": 1, "Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?": 1, "Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.": 1, "Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?": 1, "Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!": 1, "Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell.": 1, "Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.": 1, "Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?": 1, "Mister, could you spare a coin?": 1, "Mistress, a word?": 1, "Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them.": 1, "Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.": 1, "Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.": 1, "Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.": 1, "Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.": 1, "Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!": 1, "Mind yourself. There's a vicious bear on the loose.": 1, "Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?": 1, "Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?": 1, "My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.": 1, "My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.": 1, "My brother in darkness. While it's good to see you, we'll keep up appearances, yes?": 1, "My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!": 1, "My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.": 1, "My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...": 1, "My brother Jon's got the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.": 1, "My brother Jon had the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war. Too bad he died before he had the chance.": 1, "My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.": 1, "My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.": 1, "My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial.": 1, "My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.": 1, "My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Damn drunk.": 1, "My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!": 1, "My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith.": 1, "My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude.": 1, "My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it.": 1, "My blade thirsts for your blood!": 1, "My blade is yours.": 1, "My blade is yours once more.": 1, "My blade is sharp and I thirst for battle. Onward, then! ": 1, "My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.": 1, "My best beloved! I never knew the night held such vibrant color, or that the air vibrated so. And at times, it's as if the very shadows whisper.": 1, "My beloved is almost eighty years old and I think the shock of finding one of his ancestor's things has left his mind a bit... confused.": 1, "My back still hurts from all that stone work. Why were we at that standing stone anyway?": 1, "My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word.": 1, "My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself.": 1, "My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself.": 1, "My apprentice has overstepped his bounds this time.": 1, "My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace.": 1, "My bloodin' days might be over, but my son Idolaf is out there fightin' for Skyrim! Fightin' for the Empire! Ha!": 1, "My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself.": 1, "My brother tells me you've done us a service. Thank you.": 1, "My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.": 1, "My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog. ": 1, "My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by.": 1, "My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her.": 1, "My daughter's driving me crazy, so forgive me if I'm a bit on edge.": 1, "My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!": 1, "My daughter was sent to the orphanage there when I stood accused of illegal necromancy. I had no choice. Run or die.": 1, "My daughter Karita sings to the guests when she can. She has her mother's voice.": 1, "My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.": 1, "My daughter Braith says I read too much. \"Play with me, mother!\" Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves.": 1, "My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted...": 1, "My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.": 1, "My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.": 1, "My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim.": 1, "My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.": 1, "My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.": 1, "My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties.": 1, "My coat? What do you need my coat for?": 1, "My claws have rended the flesh of innumerable foes, but I have never once been felled on the field of battle.": 1, "My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.": 1, "My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.": 1, "My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.": 1, "My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?": 1, "My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well.": 1, "My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.": 1, "My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?": 1, "My camp is nearby in the ruins of Nilheim. Get me there safely and you'll be rewarded.": 1, "My business is my own. Why can't others see that?": 1, "My business is falling apart, my apprentice never listens to me and now there's talk of dragons.": 1, "My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart.": 1, "My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead.": 1, "My congratulations on defeating Harkon. Clearly, you are the superior vampire.": 1, "My apologies. I shall not trouble you with it again.": 1, "My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.": 1, "My apologies for doubting you, serjo.": 1, "Mushrooms and fungi are my life's work. When I saw Tel Mithryn I knew I had to be here.": 1, "Murdered! In cold blood!": 1, "Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.": 1, "Murder! Murder!": 1, "Murder!": 1, "Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed.": 1, "Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.": 1, "Mulush. Big Orc fella. Can't miss him.": 1, "Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much.": 1, "Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.": 1, "Muiri? Muiri? So, what, you're the cow's champion? Oh, now that is rich. Well then, champion, let's get this over with.": 1, "Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbing little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!": 1, "Much snow in Skyrim. Enough snow. M'aiq does not want any more. ": 1, "Much of what was known has been lost to the ages. He was Dragonborn, and yet he served the Dragons.": 1, "Mushrooms and molds of Vvardenfell have adapted to the ash far better than the green plants.": 1, "Much of the Dwemer army at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here.": 1, "Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.": 1, "Much better. Thanks, friend. I wouldn't have lasted much longer without that.": 1, "Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage.": 1, "Mu los vomir": 1, "Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.": 1, "Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.": 1, "Move! Up the tower!": 1, "Move it. Get to work. Get to work!": 1, "Move it, move it!": 1, "Move it soldier. Spread the word. Go. Go. Go.": 1, "Move along. There's nothing for you here.": 1, "Move along, outlander.": 1, "Move along, citizen.": 1, "Mother? Can I talk to you?": 1, "Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs.": 1, "Must be gone now.": 1, "Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.": 1, "Must be my mind playing tricks on me.": 1, "My apologies for Crescius's ravings.": 1, "My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?": 1, "My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, \"Silence, my brother.\" Every assassin in that hole must be put down!": 1, "My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.": 1, "My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.": 1, "My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.": 1, "My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know. ": 1, "My Voice has been silent for too long!": 1, "My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal.": 1, "My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.": 1, "My Listener?": 1, "My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure.": 1, "My Jarl, we need to discuss the state of Markarth's collapsing trade with the other holds.": 1, "My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn.": 1, "My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.": 1, "My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.": 1, "My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting.": 1, "Must be new around here.": 1, "Must go back and get it.": 1, "Must have run off.": 1, "Must have scared them away.": 1, "Must still be here, somewhere...": 1, "Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.": 1, "Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care.": 1, "Must... resist...": 1, "Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.": 1, "Muuuu fa.": 1, "Muwafathoo.": 1, "My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it.": 1, "My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.": 1, "My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.": 1, "Mutton.": 1, "Mind yourself in that form. Don't go damaging my thralls.": 1, "Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...": 1, "Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...": 1, "Maybe I can't leave, but my writings can.": 1, "Maybe I can find more of them.

We could all be better off now.": 1, "May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was.": 1, "May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.": 1, "May wisdom light your path.": 1, "May wisdom forever light your path.": 1, "May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty.": 1, "May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship.": 1, "May the words of poets keep you warm.": 1, "May the wind be at your back, friend.": 1, "May the sun light your path.": 1, "May the shroud of death embrace you.": 1, "May the shadows guide your journey.": 1, "May the scales of the dragonkind splinter at the touch of your arrows and crack under the weight of your sword.": 1, "May the road favor the foolish...": 1, "May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.": 1, "May the light of Auri-El cleanse your soul!": 1, "May you always prevail.": 1, "May the gods watch over your battles, friend.": 1, "Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle.": 1, "Maybe I will. What do you think about that?": 1, "Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?": 1, "Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.": 1, "Maybe the order has something to do with the Symbols up there.": 1, "Maybe that's why I worked so hard to redeem myself once I was freed.": 1, "Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open.": 1, "Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open.": 1, "Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha. ": 1, "Maybe some daedra heart. Elynea never seems to stock it.": 1, "Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something.": 1, "Maybe she's looking for something to eat?": 1, "Maybe one of these Imperials had the key.": 1, "Maybe now we can finally begin what we came here for.": 1, "Maybe not. I hear they've been seen over Skyrim too.": 1, "Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.": 1, "Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.": 1, "Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.": 1, "Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos.": 1, "Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!": 1, "Maybe if we can find out...": 1, "Maybe he's looking for something to eat?": 1, "Maybe he knows what's going on.": 1, "Maybe a hardy Nord like you doesn't need a cure-all. Hmm? What about an invisibility potion?": 1, "Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all.": 1, "Maybe I'm just confused. I can't be sure.": 1, "Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?": 1, "Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies.": 1, "Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? But not the way you make it! Ha ha ha. No, certainly not...": 1, "Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.": 1, "Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?": 1, "Maybe I won't live as long as the dark elves, but at least I didn't abandon my home.": 1, "Maybe it's time you quit then.": 1, "May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.": 1, "May the gods preserve you.": 1, "May the gods preserve us all.": 1, "May Arkay bless you with a long life.": 1, "May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave.": 1, "Maw unleashing razor  snow, Of dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe, The High King in his Jagged Crown.

So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!": 1, "Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?": 1, "Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles.

That's why I'm in charge of the place.": 1, "Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.": 1, "Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?": 1, "Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow.": 1, "Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.": 1, "Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.": 1, "Mauhulakh was such a darling boy. Until he got older and started having opinions.": 1, "Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are.": 1, "Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell.": 1, "Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.": 1, "Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.": 1, "Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey.

Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!": 1, "Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.": 1, "Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?": 1, "Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.": 1, "Mercer was able to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher... the Skeleton Key.": 1, "Mercer never told you about her?": 1, "Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me.": 1, "Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.": 1, "Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble.

All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean.": 1, "Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle.": 1, "Members of the College -- your new Arch-Mage!": 1, "Mella kalee.": 1, "Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?": 1, "Meh. Children get soft when they're coddled in a place like this.": 1, "Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together. ": 1, "Meet me then if you've still got the stomach for it.": 1, "Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it.": 1, "Meet me at my quarters.": 1, "Meeelaaak.": 1, "Men, an invader has entered the fort! Prepare yourselves for an ambush!": 1, "Might I offer an alternative?": 1, "Might be over either way. It looked like a dead end before the place started crawling. We could have missed something, though. I don't know.": 1, "Might be that I have, but I can't say for sure.": 1, "Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems.": 1, "Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt...": 1, "Mind your step.

": 1, "Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!": 1, "Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips.": 1, "Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty.": 1, "Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.": 1, "Mind what you say! The Empire has ears all over this town.": 1, "Mind what - or who - you practice this on.": 1, "Mind the way.": 1, "Milore, you need to talk some sense into your husband.": 1, "Milore, I've finally gotten that letter back from the East Empire Company.": 1, "Milore over at the Ienth Farm should be still mixing potions if you're seeking that sort of thing. Far west end of town.": 1, "Might be time to find a new home port, though, the way things are going around here.": 1, "Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in.": 1, "Might come in handy.": 1, "Might even build a new temple and put Heimskr in charge of it. Hah! I bet he'd like that.": 1, "Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.": 1, "Might need a little convincing, but she should.": 1, "Meddle in our affairs and your end will be swift and painful.": 1, "Might want to put it away that weapon... unless you plan on using it.": 1, "Mighty Arkay, I pray that you will shepherd these souls as they pass into the realm of death.": 1, "Mighty impressive.": 1, "Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.": 1, "Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?": 1, "Milk-drinker.": 1, "Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine.": 1, "Mighty Arkay, God of Mortals, hear now the prayers of your humble servant. Bless these departed souls and welcome them into the realms beyond.": 1, "Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.": 1, "Meat. Furs. Bone. Trophies of the hunt. But those are of little use to you.": 1, "Meanwhile, my very capable steward sees to the needs of the smallfolk and ensures that my hold runs smoothly.": 1, "Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.": 1, "Maybe you want to read this first.": 1, "Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.": 1, "Maybe you should leave the writing to an expert and stop making foolish suggestions.": 1, "Maybe you should just move along.": 1, "Maybe you should be the one to tell him.": 1, "Maybe you need a partner? Hmm? Just picture it. Two women, the dusty road, strapping men at every tavern, a fortune in gold to be claimed...": 1, "Maybe you just aren't up to the challenge...": 1, "Maybe you could talk some sense into my pig-headed brother.": 1, "Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here.": 1, "Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?": 1, "Maybe you could be a taster or something.": 1, "Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess.": 1, "Maybe you can help me.": 1, "Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?": 1, "Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it.": 1, "Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are.": 1, "Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.": 1, "Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.": 1, "Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.": 1, "Maybe we should try asking at the College of Winterhold. Sounds like something they'd know about.": 1, "Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.": 1, "Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all.": 1, "Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.": 1, "Maybe we should come back with more men. We don't know how many of those things will come out.": 1, "Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us.": 1, "Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon.": 1, "Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?": 1, "Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!": 1, "Maybe two hundred years ago they were.": 1, "Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?": 1, "Maybe you're finally ready to list to me.": 1, "Maybe you're looking for something... particular?": 1, "Maybe you're not so soft, after all. Now you're ready for a real challenge.": 1, "Meantime, you best steer clear of me.": 1, "Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.": 1, "Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me.": 1, "Me? No. That's Master Neloth's doing. I wasn't even born then.": 1, "Me? No. Highpoint Tower will be filled with monsters and traps.": 1, "Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for.": 1, "Me? I'm Maul. I watch the streets for 'em. If you need dirt on anythin', I'm your guy... but it'll cost you.": 1, "Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.": 1, "Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them.": 1, "Me? I hardly think so.": 1, "Me? I don't care what they're called... all I know is they're a danger to Raven Rock and they need to be stopped.": 1, "Me? Ha! Are you serious?": 1, "Me.": 1, "Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need.": 1, "Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow.": 1, "Me too.": 1, "Me and Hathrasil mostly. Mulush barks at us all day, but I wouldn't call that honest work.": 1, "Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here.": 1, "Maybe you're right. I guess I just didn't want anyone to think I couldn't handle one Nord lass.": 1, "Maybe you're right. I guess the battles I won yesterday won't win today's wars.": 1, "Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius? ": 1, "Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the Thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it.": 1, "Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr.": 1, "Meat Pies. Try one for free, come back for more. Get your meat pies.": 1, "Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel.": 1, "Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...": 1, "Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.": 1, "Maybe. Let me think about it.": 1, "Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.": 1, "Maybe... I can't help but think of some sort of temple here on the island. Why would that be?": 1, "Maybe... we should think about this some more.": 1, "Maybe, but...": 1, "That the barrier is still there is a good sign.": 1, "That the best Ulfric has?": 1, "That the best the Legion has? Heh.": 1, "Why do you think I was asking?": 1, "Why do you steal from us?": 1, "Why do you pester me with battles we can't win? I need my steward to plan for our victory, not nag me with every ill account.": 1, "Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?": 1, "Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!": 1, "Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.": 1, "Why do you delay? Are you Dovahkiin or not?": 1, "Why do you care?": 1, "Why do you ask me that?": 1, "Why do we rejoice that The Tribunal has fallen and their false promises are but a memory?": 1, "Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons.": 1, "Why do they call it Left Hand Mine? Can the miners use their right hands too?": 1, "Why do these things always happen to me?": 1, "Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?": 1, "Why do you think? End of the line.": 1, "Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.": 1, "Why do I even post guards? This is the headquarters of the Dawnguard. Well, it used to be, a long time ago.": 1, "Why do I always have to be the Elf? I don't want to!": 1, "Why didn't you then?": 1, "Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?": 1, "Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.": 1, "Why didn't you say so immediately?!": 1, "Why didn't you say so earlier? At least now we don't have to waste time searching the area.": 1, "Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help.": 1, "Why did you touch the Stone?": 1, "Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?": 1, "Why did he have to call me insane?": 1, "Why did I ever come here?": 1, "Why did Boti send you to me?": 1, "Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?": 1, "Why do I recognize that name? It sounds so familiar... Did I have a dream about someone named Miraak?": 1, "Why can't they just let us in? We won't get in the way!": 1, "Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace.": 1, "Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man.": 1, "Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?": 1, "Why is it always about money?": 1, "Why is everyone so upset? If there's Forsworn, the Jarl will take care of them, right?": 1, "Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?": 1, "Why in the world did you ever try putting armor on trolls?": 1, "Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do.": 1, "Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?": 1, "Why hide? Face Auri-El. Face your end!": 1, "Why her? What significance does she have? We don't have enough information.": 1, "Why have you never taken a wife, Baldor?": 1, "Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there.": 1, "Why hasn't a Redoran Guard been posted at my shop like I've requested?": 1, "Why fight me? Your blood is already mine.": 1, "Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?": 1, "Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.": 1, "Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.": 1, "Why don't you stay a while?": 1, "Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?": 1, "Why don't you say that louder so the entire town can hear you, idiot.": 1, "Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?": 1, "Why don't you keep your things, and I'll keep mine.": 1, "Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.": 1, "Why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke?": 1, "Why don't you go... sell something.": 1, "Why don't you go in there and get it?": 1, "Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.": 1, "Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?": 1, "Why doesn't someone do something?": 1, "Why does that sound so familiar? There's no one here by that name, and yet I swear I've heard it.": 1, "Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?": 1, "Why don't you swallow that stubborn pride of yours and ask Eorlund Gray-Mane for help?": 1, "Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?": 1, "Why can't he just leave us alone?": 1, "Why can't I train with Aela?": 1, "Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city.": 1, "Why Jon Battle-Born. You're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?": 1, "Whose side are you on, Reburrus? I'm not worried about Skyrim, I'm worried about the Reach. Specifically, the part of the Reach we're standing on.": 1, "Whoops.": 1, "Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged.": 1, "Whoever leads us next can go plead with him if they want to, but I'd rather make a tradition of my own.": 1, "Whoever did this is mine.": 1, "Whoa... Not even I'm that drunk...": 1, "Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!": 1, "Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.": 1, "Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again.": 1, "Whoa, whoa, whoa? What did you do?": 1, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot. Maybe you should just sit down for a bit...": 1, "Whoa, there. I don't know where you're going, but stay out of that mine. It isn't safe.": 1, "Why am I here? Did Master Neloth do one of his experiments on me again? ": 1, "Whoa, now... ease off on the magic...": 1, "Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?": 1, "Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?": 1, "Whoa! They killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Whoa!": 1, "Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market?": 1, "Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market the other day?": 1, "Who? Oh him. Well, I assume you killed him. Or Hermaeus Mora turned on him when you looked like the winning bet. Or a bit of both.": 1, "Who... who are you? What's going on?": 1, "Who... thirst for sky... All-Maker craves the night of sun. ": 1, "Who's this, then?": 1, "Who's there? Is that you, father?": 1, "Who's the fool now?": 1, "Who's asking?": 1, "Who'll need thralls when the very sun is at our mercy?": 1, "Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money.": 1, "Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it.": 1, "Why am I not surprised?": 1, "Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?": 1, "Why can't I remember? I was sure it was important.": 1, "Why can't Froa do it?": 1, "Why aren't you doing this in the lab, where it would be safer for all of us?": 1, "Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?": 1, "Why are you stopping?": 1, "Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins.": 1, "Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool.": 1, "Why are you still here? You're supposed to be at Korvanjund, proving Galmar right, or proving him wrong.": 1, "Why are you still here?": 1, "Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?": 1, "Why are you so hard on Elmus?": 1, "Why are you people doing this?": 1, "Why are you out here? Master Neloth is away. Aren't you supposed to stay in the tower?": 1, "Why are you out here? Aren't you supposed to be in the tower assisting Master Neloth?": 1, "Why are you looking at me like that?": 1, "Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...": 1, "Why are you here? Get away from me!": 1, "Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?": 1, "Why are the potions I requested not completed?": 1, "Why are we bothering with this?": 1, "Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?": 1, "Why are we stopping?": 1, "Why are we up here? The smell is just... ugh.": 1, "Why is this suddenly so important, anyway?": 1, "Why are you always acting like such a big baby? I've gotten us this far.": 1, "Why are you bothering me, outsider?": 1, "Why are you doing that?": 1, "Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!": 1, "Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished with each other a long time ago.": 1, "Why are you here, outsider?": 1, "Why are you here? Did you follow me?": 1, "Why are you bothering me, kinsman?": 1, "Who were you fighting against?": 1, "Why not just scream at the top of your lungs \"Here we are, monsters! We're oh so tasty! Come and get us!\"": 1, "Why not?": 1, "Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void.": 1, "Windhelm's an easy posting! they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising.": 1, "Windhelm will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.": 1, "Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are.": 1, "Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor": 1, "Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.": 1, "Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food.": 1, "Windhelm eh? City of kings, they say. Hope you packed warm though.": 1, "Will you take it to Captain Aldis?": 1, "Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?": 1, "Will you be needing anything special today?": 1, "Will you be a hunter, or will you be prey?": 1, "Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?": 1, "Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?": 1, "Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives.": 1, "Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.": 1, "Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end? ": 1, "Will she acknowledge that it is we Nord's who will determine Skyrim's future? ": 1, "Will he swear fealty to me, that all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?": 1, "Will he cast aside the Imperial coin falling into his coffers? ": 1, "Will he acknowledge that we Nords deserve to determine our own future? ": 1, "Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol.": 1, "Will I need to talk so loudly with my wife when I get married?": 1, "Will I ever see you again?": 1, "Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done.": 1, "Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there.": 1, "Wilberk tikflaaar.": 1, "Wield powerful magic incantations!": 1, "Why? You think it's funny or something?": 1, "Why? Why do you pursue me?": 1, "Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned? ": 1, "Why? Who says I have to be?": 1, "Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.": 1, "Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.": 1, "With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim.": 1, "With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight.": 1, "With a master of magic at your side, you'll have nothing to fear.": 1, "With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach.": 1, "With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?": 1, "With Sunhallowed Arrows, you would be able to produce a much more spectacular effect... causing bursts of sunlight to envelop your foes.": 1, "With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others.": 1, "With Miraak's corruption of the Stones... the Oneness of the land is disrupted, and our connection to the All-Maker is broken.": 1, "With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades.": 1, "With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it.": 1, "With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you.": 1, "With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet.": 1, "With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all.": 1, "With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do.": 1, "Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history.": 1, "Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.": 1, "Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.": 1, "Wish I could say the same for us.": 1, "Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people.": 1, "Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.": 1, "Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side.": 1, "Wise move. Now get out of here ya goat licker, before I decide the toll's gone up.": 1, "Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.": 1, "Wise decision. The vaults in the Hall of the Vigilant will guard this against future temptation.": 1, "Wise choice. Now come along with us. After we confiscate any stolen goods, you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.": 1, "Winterhold? That small college that is falling into the Sea of Ghosts?": 1, "Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.": 1, "Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on.": 1, "Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor.": 1, "Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight.": 1, "Wish he would just lighten up.": 1, "Why? What's he doing now?": 1, "Why? I want to watch the soldiers.": 1, "Why? Have you seen how they live? They cower behind their walls, afraid of every ash hopper, every netch!": 1, "Why would Tullius waste resources getting the crown only to give it to me? Poisoned perhaps? No. He's not that cunning.": 1, "Why would I do that? There's work to be done here.": 1, "Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend.": 1, "Why worry about who has the bigger chair at the table when there's more than enough to go around?": 1, "Why won't you die!": 1, "Why won't this summoning work?": 1, "Why won't anyone listen to me?!": 1, "Why was I building a temple?": 1, "Why to perform for my common man, of course! Why should only the courts and inns of wealthy towns be given the gift of music?": 1, "Why the trolls, of course! You seem to have quite a way with them.": 1, "Why the impropriety!": 1, "Why the drawn weapon? Is it contemplating violence?": 1, "Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life.": 1, "Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?": 1, "Why would anyone bother to study stars? Well, unless you're talking about that artifact that got all those... dimwits thrown out.": 1, "Why thank, you... you're very kind. Still interested?": 1, "Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.": 1, "Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.": 1, "Why specifically stars? Wait, you aren't referring to... No, there's no way you would know about that.": 1, "Why so touchy on this?": 1, "Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?": 1, "Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?": 1, "Why should I want anything? Why can't I simply be sociable with my colleagues?": 1, "Why should I tell you? I don't even know who you are.": 1, "Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?": 1, "Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!": 1, "Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus. ": 1, "Why settle for just stabbing your foes when you can roast them alive in a gout of arcane fire?": 1, "Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?": 1, "Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.": 1, "Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar.": 1, "Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.": 1, "Why would someone who isn't... like me... come all the way down here?": 1, "Why would they be looking at me? Are they upset about the service?": 1, "Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?": 1, "Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.": 1, "Why, you would be distraught with emotion, perhaps even to the point of questioning your loyalty to this Court. And we ours to you.": 1, "Why, you don't think I could do it?": 1, "Why, why have you done this to us?": 1, "Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach.": 1, "Why, this is utterly unique.": 1, "Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!": 1, "Why, thank you. You are most courteous.": 1, "Why, thank you Thonar. I'm flattered.": 1, "Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known.": 1, "Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family.": 1, "Why, hello! Here to buy? If you have to ask the price, you may be in the wrong store.": 1, "Why, good evening Jonna!": 1, "Why, because of that story about the prophecy? About some vampire trying to put the sun out?": 1, "Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?": 1, "Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know.": 1, "Why would you do such a thing?": 1, "Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?": 1, "Why would you even listen to him?": 1, "Why yes, yes of course! What a wonderful surprise!": 1, "Why you insolent little bastard...": 1, "Why you still starin' at me?": 1, "Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!": 1, "Why you'd leave your homeland behind to venture here is beyond me, but suit yourself, Nord.": 1, "Why! Why?!": 1, "Why!? Why?!": 1, "Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?": 1, "Why's that?": 1, "Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off.": 1, "Why, are you interested in my services? I warn you, my skills do not come cheaply.": 1, "Why you're leading Crescius on, I'll never understand.": 1, "With all due respect, Arch-Mage, I'm not in a position to just give this away.": 1, "Who were the perpetrators of those falsehoods?": 1, "Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.": 1, "When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout.": 1, "When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready.": 1, "When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting.": 1, "When you got that much, we'll talk.": 1, "When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know.": 1, "When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything. ": 1, "When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace.": 1, "When you get it, she's yours.": 1, "When you get back to Tamriel, let them know I still exist.": 1, "When you first transform into a Vampire Lord, you will hover in the air. While you do, you will command the powers of Blood and Night.": 1, "When you find my new steward, have him report to me. With a cup of canis root tea.": 1, "When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations.": 1, "When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future.": 1, "When you are ready to rejoin the living, just bid me so, and I will send you back.": 1, "When you make up your mind, come find me there and we'll talk about your future.": 1, "When word reached us that a settlement of Dunmer was forming on Solstheim, we were thrilled.": 1, "When word arrived in Blacklight that the Councilor's father had passed, I was asked to sail to Raven Rock with him as his second.": 1, "When will you make another snowberry pie, Yrsa? It's been a long time.": 1, "When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand.": 1, "When will Sanuarach Mine be open?": 1, "When will I learn how to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?": 1, "When we've reclaimed our homeland from the Imperials, we'll take the fight to the Thalmor. They are the true enemy. Make no mistake.": 1, "When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions.": 1, "When we stalk large game, I lead our hunters in tracking the beast. It is also a way of saying that I am the most skilled hunter in the village.": 1, "When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul.": 1, "When we get back to Cyrodiil, I swear I will hire an army of battlemages to come up here and set fire to the whole damned province.": 1, "When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse.": 1, "When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.": 1, "When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor.": 1, "When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns.": 1, "When was your first meal, Banning?": 1, "When you offer the embrace, do so away from prying eyes.

See you, no see Bilgemuck. Go, go!": 1, "Where are you!": 1, "Where are you headed?": 1, "Where are you going? You would leave, now, when we have yet to find what is at the heart of this?": 1, "Where are you going? The barracks is through here!": 1, "Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?": 1, "Where am I? You! Out with it, then.": 1, "Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.": 1, "Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean.": 1, "Whenever you're ready.": 1, "Whenever you are.": 1, "When you offer the embrace, do so away from prying eyes.

Now get out of my way!": 1, "When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.": 1, "When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away.": 1, "When you walked into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead... dragons out of legend...

You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!": 1, "Who I am really isn't as important as what I am. And what I am is an admirer. Of sorts. ": 1, "Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment.": 1, "Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered with Legionnares. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand.": 1, "Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.": 1, "Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?": 1, "Whiterun is only a means to an end.": 1, "Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should.": 1, "While you're thinking about it, the vampires will be gathering strength in the shadows, waiting to strike.": 1, "While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find.

I demand to know who did this!": 1, "Who can say, really?

The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.": 1, "Who knows. Old Delvin thinks it's some kind of a curse. I think he's crazy.": 1, "Who knows, maybe it has a death wish. Maybe it's just insane. I don't really care.": 1, "Who knows what we might find in here.": 1, "Who knows what powers the elixir will unlock!": 1, "Who knows what dangers await us in this place.": 1, "Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.": 1, "Who brought me here? They better not have touched my mushrooms. Neloth? Neloth! Is this your doing?": 1, "Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery. ": 1, "Who in the name of Azura are you?": 1, "Who in the blazes are you?! Can't you see I'm busy?": 1, "Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand.": 1, "Who has a sister?": 1, "Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka?": 1, "Who else do you think could create a staff enchanter?": 1, "Who does that? Who just leaves their garbage lying about?": 1, "Who do you think's killed more Imperials? You? Or me?": 1, "Who do you think killed more rebels? You? Or me?": 1, "Who did this to us? It isn't another one of Master Neloth's games, is it?": 1, "Who did this to me?": 1, "Who could tell the difference?": 1, "Who cares? Nords all look the same to me.": 1, "Who cares who worships what dead god? Give me something to make me draw my sword.": 1, "Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?": 1, "While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out.": 1, "While that's one less trouble maker to keep an eye on, you could have been more discreet in your approach to the problem.": 1, "While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations.": 1, "Where's Cosnach, is that lazy idiot out drinking at the Silver-Blood Inn again? On my coin?": 1, "Where's Anuriel?": 1, "Where're these vampires coming from? We need to wipe them out before things get worse.": 1, "Where'd you stash it?": 1, "Where'd you come from?!": 1, "Where will your child be living?": 1, "Where will we go? ": 1, "Where were you last night, Thonar? Busy with work or have you found some other woman who's willing to tolerate your lack of ambition?": 1, "Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing.": 1, "Where the Dragon attacked? ": 1, "Where the Black Books actually came from... no one really knows. Some appear to have been written far in the past, others might be from the future.": 1, "Where shall we journey next?": 1, "Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer - I don't want to know.": 1, "Where is your list of things you need from Raven Rock?": 1, "Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.": 1, "Where is that lazy steward of mine? Varona! No, wait. She's dead. Drovas!": 1, "Where is that ash sucking steward of mine? Varona!": 1, "Where is papa? I want to ride Karinda now!": 1, "Where is it? I know you were trying to keep it for yourself J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself!": 1, "Where is everybody? This place looks almost deserted.": 1, "Where in Oblivion are we supposed to go? Where's the way out?": 1, "Where else would we be?": 1, "Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides.": 1, "Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.": 1, "Where do you think? You have to cut it out of a Spriggan.": 1, "Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?": 1, "Where do you expect me to go?": 1, "Where do they keep coming from?": 1, "Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?": 1, "Where did you learn of a Shout used to defeat Alduin?": 1, "Where is that lazy man?": 1, "Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.": 1, "Where've you been all day?": 1, "Where? I would never... ah, I see. You are a fellow enchanter.": 1, "While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this \"Glamoril\" or its purpose or function.": 1, "While it would fill me with joy to see the Chantry back to its former glory, that time has long since passed.": 1, "While I ready things here, you find out what this woman means to the vampires. She must be important somehow.": 1, "While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift.": 1, "While I doubt we'll ever be truly rid of vampires in Skyrim, you've certainly made it a much safer place for now.": 1, "While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...": 1, "Whichever it is, I don't like it.": 1, "Which, the mutton or the vegetable?": 1, "Which other one?": 1, "Which one was the rat?": 1, "Which one is that again?": 1, "Which means you get to tag along on a little trip with me.": 1, "Which just makes you a more dangerous rival.": 1, "Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.": 1, "Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.": 1, "Which is where you come in. If killing vampires sounds good to you, go talk to Isran up in the fort. He decides who's Dawnguard material.": 1, "Which is where you come in. If killing vampires sounds good to you, come talk to Isran at Fort Dawnguard, southeast of Riften.": 1, "Where? Where is he? Can we reach him? Can we kill him?": 1, "Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on.": 1, "Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden.": 1, "Wherever the Daedra hide, the Vigil of Stendarr will cast them into the light.": 1, "Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me.": 1, "Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life.": 1, "Where did you get to?": 1, "Whether or not you've become one of us in order to survive the Soul Cairn, you're still a vampire hunter at heart.": 1, "Whether you believe it or not, the scrolls have a mind of their own. If they didn't want you to find them, they wouldn't allow it.": 1, "Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.": 1, "Whether you're simply visiting or staying here, I think you'll find our citizens will welcome you with open arms.": 1, "Whew! I'm worn out.": 1, "Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?": 1, "Which friends would those be?": 1, "Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results.": 1, "When Lord Miraak appears all shall bear witness. None will stand to oppose him!": 1, "With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out.": 1, "With any luck he'll bleed to death before anyone notices. A cold corpse will say what we want better than a warm one.": 1, "Yes, but don't tell Master Neloth. I'd have to give him your payment.": 1, "Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold.": 1, "Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here.": 1, "Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis.": 1, "Yes, boss.": 1, "Yes, because a worthless City Orc is just what we've been waiting for. Finally, we're saved!": 1, "Yes, and just like weeds, they're nothin' but trouble.": 1, "Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to...": 1, "Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you. ": 1, "Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return.": 1, "Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified.": 1, "Yes, and I couldn't tell you why.": 1, "Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone.": 1, "Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground.": 1, "Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!": 1, "Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead.": 1, "Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance.": 1, "Yes, a crossbow. Best thing for killing vampires. Just take a few shots at those crates over there.": 1, "Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you.": 1, "Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please.": 1, "Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous.": 1, "Yes, Thongvor. I'll draft the letter immediately. ": 1, "Yes, Thongvor.": 1, "Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know.": 1, "Yes, Nightingale, what is it?": 1, "Yes, Mulush.": 1, "Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients.": 1, "Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?": 1, "Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?": 1, "Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay.": 1, "Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.": 1, "Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me.": 1, "Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure.": 1, "Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry.": 1, "Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?": 1, "Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day.": 1, "Yes, it worked! The steam is flowing. Now it should be as simple as...": 1, "Yes, it is, and it's mine. ": 1, "Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.": 1, "Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?": 1, "Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot.": 1, "Yes, how may I serve you, milord?": 1, "Yes, how may I serve you, milady?": 1, "Yes, his \"help\" which did not require him to kill my father. Such is the way of Herma-Mora, the eternal enemy of the Skaal.": 1, "Yes, he's a fanatic... he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't you understand how that makes me feel?": 1, "Yes, he definitely sounds like he knows what to do.": 1, "Yes, from what I've heard I expect Tolfdir will be occupied for some time. Hmm, that is a problem, isn't it?": 1, "Yes, fellow Nightingale?": 1, "Yes, but not likely the one you intend.": 1, "Yes, father. Which cask should we open?": 1, "Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?": 1, "Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten.": 1, "Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me.": 1, "Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.": 1, "Yes, child. Nana Ildene has taken care of the Silver-Bloods for many years....": 1, "Yes, champion of Azura?": 1, "Yes, certainly. Are you willing to let me have them?": 1, "Yes, can I help you with something?": 1, "Yes, but... not so loud!": 1, "Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?": 1, "Yes, but when I was here it wasn't so... crumbly. This used to be a city.": 1, "Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see.": 1, "Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something.": 1, "Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees.": 1, "Yes, father.": 1, "Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word.": 1, "Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!": 1, "Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us.": 1, "Yes, I imagine it would to someone not of our people.": 1, "Yes, I hope this helps you.": 1, "Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know.": 1, "Yes, I hear that question often.": 1, "Yes, I have. Adara made the rings herself. She is learning to bend the metal well.": 1, "Yes, I do. I haven't been able to get it, though. But maybe together we can unlock the secrets the Dwemer left behind.": 1, "Yes, I did. When I told you that I was grateful for my daughter's safe return, I told the truth. But I did not tell you everything.": 1, "Yes, I did. I shouldn't be the one to tell you about this. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. Believe me, he'll know.": 1, "Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me.": 1, "Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy.": 1, "Yes, I can smell it on you.": 1, "Yes, I can feel your defenses crumbling. You want it to end. You want to give in to me.": 1, "Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well.": 1, "Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?": 1, "Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before.": 1, "Yes, Grelod?": 1, "Yes, Feran. Of course. I'll see to it.": 1, "Yes, Dean. Thank you.": 1, "Yes, Dean Inge.": 1, "Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you.": 1, "Yes! I like the way you think. There are whispers of where we might find one, too. ": 1, "Yes! How'd you get this? Never mind, here. It's not much, but its something. ": 1, "Yes!  The path is clear!": 1, "Yes sir. ": 1, "Yes sir, of course.": 1, "Yes sir, fine sir.": 1, "Yes sir, I have.": 1, "Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.": 1, "Yes mother? What is it?": 1, "Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow.": 1, "Yes, General Tullius.": 1, "Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care that they're all gone now.": 1, "Yes, I know the one you saw. It watches us each night, always moving closer.": 1, "Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change.": 1, "Yes, Legate.": 1, "Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said.": 1, "Yes, I... I'm not sure what to say. Did we build that? I really don't remember.": 1, "Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait.": 1, "Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever.": 1, "Yes, I'm sure that's true.": 1, "Yes, I'm proud to say that I grow or harvest most of it myself.": 1, "Yes, I'm positive I heard something.": 1, "Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame...": 1, "Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse.": 1, "Yes, I'm a powerful wizard. No, I won't put on a magic show for you.": 1, "Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim.": 1, "Yes, I was bored talking to you anyway.": 1, "Yes, I think you're just the adventurous sort I need. I have a job offer for you.": 1, "Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day.": 1, "Yes, I think I'd enjoy a woman like your wife.": 1, "Yes, I suppose they might. Ah well.": 1, "Yes, I know. And then Miraak's power will be yours as well.": 1, "Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware.": 1, "Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned.": 1, "Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons.": 1, "Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong.": 1, "Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing.": 1, "Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent.": 1, "Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies.": 1, "Yes, I remember how I felt being there with her the first time, before we were wed. I hope to see you more around the hall, friend.": 1, "Yes, I remember that you ate one of them all by yourself. Maybe this time, you will leave some for the rest of us!": 1, "Yes, I see that. I trust his capture was not too difficult a task?": 1, "Yes, I see them now... One contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of the potency of ancient blood.": 1, "Yes, I suppose someone has to be around here. Have you seen the condition of this sorry excuse for a city?": 1, "Yes, I suppose there is.": 1, "Yes, I recognize it.": 1, "Yes dear.": 1, "Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way.": 1, "Yes, lass? Did you need something?": 1, "Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?": 1, "Yes, yes, thank you and all that.": 1, "Yes, yes, of course. Goodbye.": 1, "Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens...": 1, "Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!": 1, "Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!": 1, "Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before...": 1, "Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off.": 1, "Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead.": 1, "Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.": 1, "Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he? ": 1, "Yes, yes it is.": 1, "Yes, yes I do.": 1, "Yes, wouldn't want to miss the lush summer we have ahead. ": 1, "Yes, yes, you're entirely brilliant. Conquering madness and all that. Blah blah blah.": 1, "Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos.": 1, "Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? ": 1, "Yes, what about Jarl Erikur?": 1, "Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on.": 1, "Yes, well... I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all of you... I am sorry, you know.": 1, "Yes, well. Perhaps you're right.": 1, "Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me.": 1, "Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me.": 1, "Yes, well. After the unfortunate incident that occurred, I think it's best if we just move on.": 1, "Yes, well, the mercenaries did their jobs. Worth every septim. Of course, they might disagree... the dead ones, anyway. Gods, what a disaster.": 1, "Yes, well, see that you keep at it. That is all.": 1, "Yes, well so do I. That's why I was hoping you could help.": 1, "Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation.": 1, "Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing.": 1, "Yes, very good.": 1, "Yes, what is it?": 1, "Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually.": 1, "Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy - consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go mine.": 1, "Yes, yes. Aren't you lovely looking like that. Do you mind?": 1, "Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil. ": 1, "Yes, youngling. Have a seat.": 1, "Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre.": 1, "Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness.": 1, "Yes, you've explained yourself. I'm supposed to just throw myself in front of you all and offer protection, am I?": 1, "Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes.": 1, "Yes, you're right. She still mourns for my father, and having me near brings her comfort.": 1, "Yes, you're innocent. As innocent as anyone can be in this city.": 1, "Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?": 1, "Yes, you certainly do.": 1, "Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior.": 1, "Yes, yes... goodbye.": 1, "Yes, yes. You're Dragonborn. We're all very impressed.": 1, "Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here...": 1, "Yes, yes. Always the noble vampire hunter.": 1, "Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously.": 1, "Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for \"Shout.\"": 1, "Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about...": 1, "Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it.": 1, "Yes, yes. Let's see what we have...": 1, "Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So \"hello.\" There, satisfied?": 1, "Yes, yes. I'll write it out, and you can pick up a copy from Talvas in a few days.": 1, "Yes, yes. I'll find something around here to pay you with.": 1, "Yes, yes. I have a lot of research to do.": 1, "Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now.": 1, "Yes, yes. Goodbye.": 1, "Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable...": 1, "Yes, yes. Closer. I won't bite. Promise.": 1, "Yes, yes. Canis root tea. And don't let Ulves water it down.": 1, "Yes, yes. As I was saying, heart stones can animate nearby ash.": 1, "Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.": 1, "Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes.": 1, "Yes, this camp is small, but it's all we have left.": 1, "Yes, they smell like trolls. But do you have to? Consider washing up a bit more often.": 1, "Yes, of course. It said \"A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek.\"": 1, "Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?": 1, "Yes, of course.": 1, "Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day.": 1, "Yes, of course! That's wonderful news!": 1, "Yes, of course Lokil. Do not forget who brought you news of the Vigilants' discovery.": 1, "Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him.": 1, "Yes, my mistress. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.": 1, "Yes, my lord. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.": 1, "Yes, my lady?": 1, "Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her.": 1, "Yes, my friend? How may I help?": 1, "Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember.": 1, "Yes, my Thane? Do you need something?": 1, "Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks.": 1, "Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task.": 1, "Yes, mum?": 1, "Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today.": 1, "Yes, milord? What can I help you with?": 1, "Yes, milady? What can I help you with?": 1, "Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed.": 1, "Yes, master. Thank you, master. I'll fix it right away.": 1, "Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away.": 1, "Yes, master. Although the grand soul gem only has a common soul in it.": 1, "Yes, master.": 1, "Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well.": 1, "Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves.": 1, "Yes, ma'am.": 1, "Yes, let's!": 1, "Yes, let me show you.": 1, "Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you.": 1, "Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault.": 1, "Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.": 1, "Yes, okay. Well thank you.": 1, "Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most.": 1, "Yes, the staff. Interesting...": 1, "Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.": 1, "Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.": 1, "Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls.": 1, "Yes, the \"Strident Squall\" or something like that.": 1, "Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask.": 1, "Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course.": 1, "Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine.": 1, "Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side.": 1, "Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right.": 1, "Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left.": 1, "Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar.": 1, "Yes, that's it. Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald was sure it held some long-lost vampire artifact of some kind.": 1, "Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war.": 1, "Yes, that will be fine. Thank you.": 1, "Yes, that was my point. I felt it was rather clear.": 1, "Yes, perhaps you can convince him. I would be grateful if you would do this thing, outsider.": 1, "Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon.": 1, "Yes, quite. I'm growing weary of speaking to you and my traitorous daughter.": 1, "Yes, run and hide!": 1, "Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time.": 1, "Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you.": 1, "Yes, lad? Did you need something?": 1, "Yes, si... Isran.": 1, "Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her.": 1, "Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women...": 1, "Yes, son. We should try to capture it.": 1, "Yes, suffer for you.": 1, "Yes, thank you Arch-Mage.": 1, "Yes, that was a most disturbing experience. But to answer your question, the architecture was strange, almost otherworldly.": 1, "Yes, sir, Captain Veleth, sir.": 1, "With all due respect, those \"things\" aren't the only problem we have right now.": 1, "Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him.": 1, "Yergh!": 1, "Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lass.": 1, "Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lad.": 1, "Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end.": 1, "Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.": 1, "Wooocha!": 1, "Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.": 1, "Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else. ": 1, "Wonderful. You've just made an important contribution to the advancement of a Dwemer scholarship.": 1, "Wonderful. Where to begin?": 1, "Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth.": 1, "Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.": 1, "Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off.": 1, "Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me. ": 1, "Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.": 1, "Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured...": 1, "Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help. ": 1, "Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close...": 1, "Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.": 1, "Wonderful. Carry on, then.": 1, "Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?": 1, "Wonderful, simply wonderful! Councilor Morvayn will be quite pleased when he hears about this.": 1, "Wonderful, just wonderful!": 1, "Wonderful, dear. Thank you.": 1, "Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too.": 1, "Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend.": 1, "Wonderful! Here, take this. I hope it's fair compensation.": 1, "Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.": 1, "Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war.": 1, "Woman, you'll be the death of me yet. Fine, take your time. I'll just die of thirst in the heat of this forge.": 1, "Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there.": 1, "Wonderful. I'll make the necessary preparations for infusion into the Chalice presently.": 1, "Wolves, trolls, mammoths and giants would all like to make a meal of us.": 1, "Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat.": 1, "Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!": 1, "Would you be interested in having the passage to the Courtyard restored? Harkon clearly never cared much for it.": 1, "Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.": 1, "Would it kill you to let a man go about his business in peace? Really, the nerve...": 1, "Would he give me skooma? I might do it for some skooma.": 1, "Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.": 1, "Worthless mercenaries.": 1, "Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them.": 1, "Worse. The loss of shipments from Forsworn attacks are really hitting us hard.": 1, "Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent.": 1, "Worry about yourself.": 1, "Worried one of them is going to take your place?": 1, "Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.": 1, "Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere.": 1, "Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead.": 1, "Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!": 1, "Working metal isn't easy. Let me show you a few things.": 1, "Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.": 1, "Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine.": 1, "Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable.": 1, "Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket.": 1, "Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.": 1, "Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.": 1, "Work, damn you!": 1, "Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion.": 1, "Work in it? I own it.": 1, "Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line.": 1, "Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.": 1, "Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to.": 1, "Words reached us that the dragons have returned. I wonder if we'll see them on Solstheim?": 1, "Words can't even begin to describe how much I appreciate you bringing this to me.": 1, "Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.": 1, "Wolf-breath!": 1, "Woah... watch it!": 1, "Woah...": 1, "With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means.": 1, "With the cubes I retrieved, we should now have a total of five. I hope you haven't left more scattered about.": 1, "With the cube I retrieved from the pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes - exactly what we need.": 1, "With the ash spawn threat taken care of, I can give my men the rest they deserve. Well done, friend.": 1, "With the ash from Red Mountain covering half the island, it's astonishing how much Solstheim reminds me of home.": 1, "With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time.": 1, "With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately.": 1, "With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately.": 1, "With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break.": 1, "With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change.": 1, "With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours.": 1, "With tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there.": 1, "With skill and patience. It's very much like working ebony.": 1, "With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks.": 1, "With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form. ": 1, "With pleasure. Nature has a way of finding vengeance, though. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering. ": 1, "With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running.": 1, "With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me.": 1, "With my guidance you will become a deadly instrument, striking terror in the hearts of mortals wherever you tread.": 1, "With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts.": 1, "With me? What's the matter with you?": 1, "With me, you kill Skyrim's last hope. Mark my words. You'll all be serving elven masters soon. And know then, that I would have stopped them.": 1, "With me, up the tower!": 1, "With me, prisoner. Let's go!": 1, "With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword.": 1, "With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible.": 1, "With father I said goodbye... with mother I said goodbye. Reyda leaves and Narfi can't say goodbye.": 1, "With experience, your powers will grow and you will discover new ways to use them.": 1, "With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger.": 1, "With both Alduin and Paarthurnax dead, a dark chapter in history will finally be closed.": 1, "With open arms, with cheers and song, with joy in my heart and tears in my eyes!": 1, "With the lighting of the effigy...": 1, "With the mines open, Raven Rock has become a significant colony of the Dunmer people again.": 1, "With the mines shut down, there's no telling how much longer Raven Rock's going to last. Hopefully, Councilor Morvayn has a plan.": 1, "Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment.": 1, "Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.": 1, "Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?": 1, "Wizards. There oughta be a law against them.": 1, "Wizard tricks! An Orc faces the enemy. He doesn't hide from him.": 1, "Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed.": 1, "Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.": 1, "Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading.": 1, "Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect.": 1, "Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast.": 1, "Without the Hall, the Vigilants need a new rallying point.": 1, "Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?": 1, "Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement.": 1, "Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy...": 1, "Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return.": 1, "Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit.": 1, "Without a Septim on the throne of the Empire, Dagon was able to leave Oblivion through the gates and attack.": 1, "With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward.": 1, "With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.": 1, "With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home.": 1, "With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters.": 1, "With the water level this high, we can swim across the collapsed part of the passage and reach the other side.": 1, "With them, and the materials in this room, we should have everything we need.": 1, "Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...": 1, "With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs.": 1, "With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can.": 1, "With you as my muse, how could I not?": 1, "With you by my side, is that right Horik?": 1, "With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to raise the dead.": 1, "Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment.": 1, "Without Councilor Morvayn, Raven Rock has no future. Keep that in mind next time you decide to help or not.": 1, "With this the world could have a better understanding of the Dwemer! ": 1, "Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!": 1, "Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?": 1, "Would you like to buy a lady a drink?": 1, "Yeah, yeah. Go on in.": 1, "Yeah, why?": 1, "Yeah, whatever.": 1, "Yeah, what of it?": 1, "Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort.": 1, "Yeah, well, and I don't want them trying to kill me. So the answer is still no.": 1, "Yeah, well I don't see anything.": 1, "Yeah, we're all looking for something.": 1, "Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney.": 1, "Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone.": 1, "Yeah, too bad. Lord Harkon's new favorite, dead so soon after joining the family.": 1, "Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares.": 1, "Yeah, that's what papa says too.": 1, "Yeah, that was a shame.": 1, "Yeah, yeah. Goodbye, kill lots of people, Hail Sithis, and all that.": 1, "Yeah, thanks.": 1, "Yeah, take care of yourself.": 1, "Yeah, sure.": 1, "Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now.": 1, "Yeah, so. What can I get you? Got everything from potions to pitchforks.": 1, "Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in.": 1, "Yeah, just around this bend.": 1, "Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?": 1, "Yeah, it was stupid of me.": 1, "Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff.": 1, "Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry.": 1, "Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got.": 1, "Yeah, got this note.": 1, "Yeah, good luck.": 1, "Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected.": 1, "Yeah, take care.": 1, "Yeah, fie!": 1, "Yeah, you said that yesterday.": 1, "Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.": 1, "Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble.": 1, "Yep. I have just one question for you.": 1, "Yep. Ale's going bad.": 1, "Yeeeaaahhh!": 1, "Yeeaahh! There.": 1, "Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all.": 1, "Years of work, finally going to pay off...": 1, "Years of planning, ruined!": 1, "Years of mocking, of dismissal... and now suddenly here you are, begging for help.": 1, "Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research.": 1, "Years back, I had to ferret away some booty nearby. We'd sunk an Imperial Galleon off the coast. Good plunder, but we needed to travel light.": 1, "Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going.": 1, "Yeah? You change your mind? The Dawnguard could use somebody like you.": 1, "Yeah? Why?": 1, "Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea.": 1, "Yeah? What?": 1, "Yeah? What is it?": 1, "Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later.": 1, "Yeah? Well, I got news for you; there's nothing to see here.": 1, "Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe.": 1, "Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.": 1, "Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...": 1, "Yeah. Threw it in the lake like you said.": 1, "Yeah. Right.": 1, "Yeah. Next time.": 1, "Yeah. Kind of scary too.": 1, "Yeah. Is it just you, or do you have... people in your life?": 1, "Yeah. I'm glad we can finally stand down- getting tired of looking over my shoulder all the time.": 1, "Yeah. Here.": 1, "Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.": 1, "Yeah? What's your problem?": 1, "Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy.": 1, "Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands.": 1, "Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?": 1, "Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you.": 1, "Wujeeta, we need to talk.": 1, "Wrong!": 1, "Wrong on all accounts, aren't I?": 1, "Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified.": 1, "Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.": 1, "Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.": 1, "Wow. Yeah. That sounds great, mother. Only, um... it's just that...": 1, "Wow. Sorry about that.": 1, "Wow. Nice weapon! Can I hold it? I promise not to break anything. Honest!": 1, "Wow.": 1, "Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.": 1, "Wow! That's impressive.": 1, "Wow! Look at that robe. Are you a wizard? ": 1, "Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you.": 1, "Wow! Look at all the colors!": 1, "Wound up turning into a vampire. The Jarl, unable to kill his own son, spent a fortune building this keep and hiring men to guard it.": 1, "Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?": 1, "Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.": 1, "Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.": 1, "Wouldn't it be easier just to turn off the trap? Like so?": 1, "Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good.": 1, "Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.": 1, "Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here.": 1, "Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately.": 1, "Would you want me to? After what happened the last time I tried it?": 1, "Would you two shut up before Brurid hears you messing around.": 1, "Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?": 1, "Would you look at that. An exploding crossbow bolt. This should be fun!": 1, "Would you look at that!": 1, "Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!": 1, "Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad.": 1, "Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days.": 1, "Wuuuu...": 1, "Yeah, but Twice-Killed has more of a ring to it!": 1, "Yeah, all right. I'll take you as far as I can.": 1, "Yeah, I was lucky though. After Vex tore the guy to pieces, she gave me a potion. If she hadn't of been there...": 1, "Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere.": 1, "Yeah, I heard you before. I just don't care. You won't kick me out of here, and we both know it.": 1, "Yeah, I figured it would be like that. Here you go.": 1, "Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there.": 1, "Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.": 1, "Yeah! Get her! Kill her!": 1, "Yeah yeah...": 1, "Yea! Thanks, mister- um, Papa! I promise, I'll be the best daughter ever!": 1, "Yea! Thanks, Mama! I promise, I'll be the best daughter ever!": 1, "Ye gods! You think Alva is a vampire?": 1, "Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have.": 1, "Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.": 1, "Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.": 1, "Yarr!": 1, "Wuuuuuupaaaaa!": 1, "Xhuth! Black-Briar or not, say that again and so help me you're going to need more than your mother to protect you from me.": 1, "Yaaawwwwnn....": 1, "Yaahh!": 1, "Yaggh!": 1, "Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule.": 1, "Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?": 1, "Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?": 1, "Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.": 1, "Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path.": 1, "Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help.": 1, "Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need.": 1, "Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.": 1, "Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.": 1, "Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.": 1, "Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.": 1, "When Lord Miraak appears all shall bear witness. None shall stand to oppose him!": 1, "When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style.": 1, "Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something.": 1, "Well, yes. Probably.": 1, "Well, yes. But the Key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.": 1, "Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course.": 1, "Well, yes! Please!": 1, "Well, would you look at that! Argonian Ale! My thanks, friend. Here, take this here healing potion. I, er, \"found\" it in the temple. ": 1, "Well, worry not over what can't be undone.": 1, "Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me.": 1, "Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are.": 1, "Well, when you put it that way...": 1, "Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there.": 1, "Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life.": 1, "Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?": 1, "Well, what news? Is Alain...": 1, "Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available.": 1, "Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all.": 1, "Well, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and open it.": 1, "Well, what are they up to?": 1, "Well, well. You're a lot smarter than I expected. I hope you brought the gold.": 1, "Well, well. You made it. Good. Isran's in the fort. He'll get you sorted out.": 1, "Well, well. You have proven to be a more valuable ally than I anticipated.": 1, "Well, well. Where've you been, Vingalmo? Nose stuck in a book all day?": 1, "Well, well. Seems you're proving fairly useful for an outlander.": 1, "Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you.": 1, "Well, well. It's been a long time since someone from the Guild's bothered to make their way out here.": 1, "Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege.": 1, "Well, well. I haven't seen one of these beauties in a long time. A rare find in the original falmer language.": 1, "Well, well. He wants the Chalice, then.": 1, "Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies.": 1, "Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances...": 1, "Well, what happened? Were you able to track down Vendil? Out with it!": 1, "Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!": 1, "Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students.": 1, "Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome.": 1, "Well. Nobody is here now.": 1, "Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources.": 1, "Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.": 1, "Well. I wish it were that simple.": 1, "Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?": 1, "Well. I do suppose thanks are in order. So... my thanks.": 1, "Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change.": 1, "Well. Anything to relieve the boredom. As long as it doesn't get back to me.": 1, "Well. After you.": 1, "Well, your thrall awaits and we have given him the Elder Scroll. Command him to read it, and let us hear the words of prophecy together.": 1, "Well, your loss...": 1, "Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother.": 1, "Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you.": 1, "Well, your bounty is low... All right, get out of my sight. But you're known to me now, scum. Remember that.": 1, "Well, you can Shout now. You couldn't before, right? That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.": 1, "Well, you've met most of us. My father's not exactly the most stable, and eventually he drove my mother crazy with him.": 1, "Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself.": 1, "Well, you'd better say something. And soon.": 1, "Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath.": 1, "Well, you smell like a Hagraven. And you look like one, too!": 1, "Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line. ": 1, "Well, you see, that's a little complicated, and... you know what? Never mind. Guess I'm not retiring anytime soon.": 1, "Well, you saved me from those vampires. I suppose the least that I can do is hear you out.": 1, "Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons...": 1, "Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it.": 1, "Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean.": 1, "Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good.": 1, "Well, you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out our next move, or you could let me help.": 1, "Well, you clearly possess the minimum aptitude required. Congratulations. I'll escort you up to the gate.": 1, "Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it.": 1, "Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?": 1, "Well, well. Adril's got himself a spy, does he?": 1, "Well, well.": 1, "Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed.": 1, "Well, then. I'll do my best to keep the hall together until that day comes. ": 1, "Well, then. Fine. Have a nice day.": 1, "Well, then you'll just have to clean them twice a day. Whatever it takes.": 1, "Well, then you won't be leaving here at all.": 1, "Well, then this should be no problem at all for you.": 1, "Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?": 1, "Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly.": 1, "Well, the truth is my brother really died long ago.": 1, "Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech. ": 1, "Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once.": 1, "Well, the easy answer, of course. Mead! ": 1, "Well, the dragons are a constant danger, but so far they have taken little interest in our village. Thank the All-Maker for that!": 1, "Well, the bottle broke on the netch, and it must have swallowed its contents because it started floating sort of tilted.": 1, "Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately.": 1, "Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk.": 1, "Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.": 1, "Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad.": 1, "Well, that's usually the trick. It's possible to do it through a simple portal.": 1, "Well, that's the thing. We don't know where he is. Haven't seen him in years.": 1, "Well, that's the second one - we're halfway there. I'll keep looking. See you soon!": 1, "Well, that's the good and the bad of it. ": 1, "Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you. ": 1, "Well, that's something at least.": 1, "Well, that's progress of a sort. But we'll need all three down at once to get to the pump control.": 1, "Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!": 1, "Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking \"Mogo's Mead\" really gets the place moving.": 1, "Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week.": 1, "Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around.": 1, "Well, that's interesting....": 1, "Well, that's certainly a line of thinking I can relate to.": 1, "Well, the Moth Priests are the only ones I've heard of who can do it. They spend years preparing before they start reading, though.": 1, "Well, then...  Best of luck to you.": 1, "Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed.": 1, "Well, there is one reason that comes to mind. ": 1, "Well, we've got that knife. There has to be a use for it.": 1, "Well, we're definitely not going to find our way out from here.": 1, "Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.": 1, "Well, we have to cut down something!": 1, "Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now.": 1, "Well, we had to do something. I'd rather starve than eat another one of those horrid turnips.": 1, "Well, we had one go missing from the Pawned Prawn, and I was just wondering...": 1, "Well, we got the knife... now all we need to do is track down one of those Canticle Trees.": 1, "Well, using an arrow with the bow that's been dipped in blood may cause it to function differently... corrupting its purpose.": 1, "Well, unless you want to deal with the draugr, this whole little venture of ours is over.": 1, "Well, unless my vision's playing tricks, there seems to be some sort of magical effect around you. Seems like we're on the right track.": 1, "Well, too bad for you... I intend on keeping it. Let's see if your blood has any power to it!": 1, "Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns.": 1, "Well, this isn't exactly a palace, is it? Still, it's sturdy, secure, and seems defensible.": 1, "Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?": 1, "Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting.": 1, "Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into.": 1, "Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often.": 1, "Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly.": 1, "Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy.": 1, "Well, there's a small enclave of Nords to the north at Skaal Village. They pretty much keep to themselves, and we both like it that way.": 1, "Well, there's a warrior, an archer and a mage. Perhaps each statue is meant to represent a different method of combat.": 1, "Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall.": 1, "Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?": 1, "Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall.": 1, "Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?": 1, "Well, there's morals, and then there's money. In this case, money wins.": 1, "Well, there's the Falmer, to start with. Deadly rapids. Major earthquakes. Massive chasms. Unstable ground. Lethal falls.": 1, "Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you.": 1, "Well, there's this boy, and...": 1, "Well, this certainly won't help our image.": 1, "Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island.": 1, "Well, that's a start. Unless there's some way past that dead end, though, we're still stuck here.": 1, "Well. There's something to be said for honesty, I suppose.": 1, "Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs.": 1, "What about being loyal to his wife?": 1, "What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?": 1, "What about Mercer? Have you asked him?": 1, "What about Auriel's Bow? Do you know where we can find it?": 1, "What about \"Auntie Faida\" in Dragon Bridge? She runs a bar, and you said she's one of your favorite girls!": 1, "What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended.": 1, "What a wonderful place you've brought me.": 1, "What a waste. Fools.": 1, "What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!": 1, "What a waste of time.": 1, "What a waste of a good specimen.": 1, "What a vulgar display.": 1, "What a sight....": 1, "What a mess. I'm getting tired of wading around in this muck.": 1, "What about my father? Was he a good hunter?": 1, "What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone.": 1, "What a display of color!": 1, "What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns.": 1, "What a curious city. It's so... open.": 1, "What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.": 1, "What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll keep that between the two of us, alright?": 1, "What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.": 1, "What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is!": 1, "What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.": 1, "What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.": 1, "What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity.": 1, "What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores.": 1, "What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people.": 1, "What I didn't know is someone had hired the Morag Tong to kill him as well.": 1, "What I can't figure out is why she said it that way.": 1, "What a fascinating conversation that would be!": 1, "What I am doing is none of your business!": 1, "What about the other one?": 1, "What about them? They seem loyal enough.": 1, "What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?": 1, "What are you lookin' at?": 1, "What are you in for, new blood?": 1, "What are you hiding, priest?": 1, "What are you gawking at, outlander?": 1, "What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.": 1, "What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen. Now!": 1, "What are you doing? I thought we were friends!": 1, "What are you doing? Get off the road!": 1, "What are you doing that's so dangerous?": 1, "What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!": 1, "What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!": 1, "What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?": 1, "What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.": 1, "What about them?": 1, "What are you doing here? I told them no visitors.": 1, "What are we going to do? How do we save the College?": 1, "What are those things growing out of his eyes?": 1, "What are those things growing out of her eyes?": 1, "What an interesting idea. I think if someone were to do something like that, there would definitely be a certain amount of loot to be shared...": 1, "What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis.": 1, "What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.": 1, "What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?": 1, "What am I supposed to do until then?": 1, "What am I going to do?": 1, "What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?": 1, "What about you? What were your parents like?": 1, "What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!": 1, "What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?": 1, "What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?": 1, "What are you doing down here?": 1, "What Dreyla chooses to do is her concern, not yours.": 1, "Wha... Your shoes? We get robbed by bandits, my clothes torn to shreds by some giant cat, our bodyguard eaten by a dragon...": 1, "Wha- who... you're that one from Helgen. Barely made it out of there myself. I hurt my back and I- I just need something for the pain.": 1, "Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.": 1, "Well?": 1, "Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.": 1, "Well... you did show remarkable initiative. And you didn't have to bring the crown to me...": 1, "Well... yes. There is something. ": 1, "Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help.": 1, "Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.": 1, "Well... so long as you don't tell anyone. Here take it and slip into a booth before someone notices.": 1, "Well... okay. My father owns the Winking Skeever. But it's the family business, so it'll be mine when he kicks off.": 1, "Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.": 1, "Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again.": 1, "Well... let's hear it.": 1, "Well... just get it done.": 1, "Well... if you say so.": 1, "Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?": 1, "Well... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even.": 1, "Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications. ": 1, "Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me.": 1, "Well... No. Not really. Not directly, I mean.": 1, "Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done...": 1, "Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation.": 1, "Well... I... Oh, fine. Here. This is all I have.": 1, "Well... I'll let you go about your business.": 1, "Well... I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it.": 1, "Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!": 1, "Well... I suppose important research is worth every coin. All right. You have yourself a deal. How's double and a half its value in trade?": 1, "Well... I heard there's a really nice tailor's in Solitude. And... and maybe the Khajiit sell dolls? They always have the best toys.": 1, "Well... I guess nothing bad happened the last time. Fine, we'll sail as soon as I get paid.": 1, "Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.": 1, "Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive.": 1, "Well... a man's got to make a living, after all. Fine. We'll cast off immediately.": 1, "Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.": 1, "Well? I'm waiting.": 1, "Well? In you go.": 1, "Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law! ": 1, "Wh- no... I.... Oh, by the Eight, fine. But only to the edge of town!": 1, "Wet, you say?": 1, "Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked.": 1, "Werewolf! Kill the monster!": 1, "Werewolf!": 1, "Weren't expecting this, were you?": 1, "Weren't expecting that, were you!": 1, "Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears? ": 1, "Were you now?": 1, "Were you looking for me?": 1, "Were you able to salvage any of the mead?": 1, "Were you able to learn anything?": 1, "Were we... did you help us?": 1, "Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?": 1, "Were did you go?": 1, "Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done.": 1, "Well? Is everything out there all right?": 1, "Well? Is it done?": 1, "Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?": 1, "Well? Ready to join the fight against the damn vampires?": 1, "Well? Spit it out, mortal. I haven't got an eternity!": 1, "Well? There must be a way through. Look around.": 1, "Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle.": 1, "Well? What are we waiting for?": 1, "Well? What happened!": 1, "Well? What is the meaning of this?": 1, "Well? What word of the Emperor?": 1, "Well? What's it going to be?": 1, "Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?": 1, "Welp, time to gather more supplies I guess.": 1, "Well? What are you waiting for? Go get me that book!": 1, "What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.": 1, "Well, that's a ridiculous question. Everyone traveling through here has said that the Oblivion Gates have been opening all over Tamriel.": 1, "Well, that was important.": 1, "Well, I... You know, I can't remember. It's important, I think, but it's hard for me to think about.": 1, "Well, I... If you're sure...": 1, "Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages.": 1, "Well, I... ": 1, "Well, I've never been one to pass up an opportunity.": 1, "Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos.": 1, "Well, I've certainly heard worse things.": 1, "Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell.": 1, "Well, I've been so busy, I dunno. What are you, kidding me?": 1, "Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!...": 1, "Well, I'm proud of both of you. I haven't been so busy since those nobles from Solitude come into the city three years ago.": 1, "Well, I'm pretty sure about two things.": 1, "Well, I'm not quite done myself. ": 1, "Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of...": 1, "Well, J'zargo is surprised. And pleased! There is real competition here. This is good.": 1, "Well, I'm hoping to do something similar... if I could connect a living being to the forces of the Red Mountain well... that would be formidable.": 1, "Well, I'm glad we've established this early, rather than me hearing about it years or decades later when the whispers behind my back are loud enough.": 1, "Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.": 1, "Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain.": 1, "Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment.": 1, "Well, I'm \"not a scholar\" of architecture. And that's that.": 1, "Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction.": 1, "Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then.": 1, "Well, I'll take it under advisement. Thank you.": 1, "Well, I'll be. That's the one.": 1, "Well, I'll be out of your hair soon enough.": 1, "Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill.": 1, "Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home.": 1, "Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home.": 1, "Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious.": 1, "Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the old Blades left for us.": 1, "Well, I was thinking... we should. We could stock all kinds of specialty items. You know, to cater to some of our more.... \"eclectic\" customers.": 1, "Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours and be on our way.": 1, "Well, a few reasons come to mind.": 1, "Well, don't just stand there! Go deal with the Draugr while I try to hold the survivors together.": 1, "Well, don't just stand there!": 1, "Well, did you bring back any mead?": 1, "Well, considering no one else in Skyrim would buy something they couldn't possibly read, I'd say you don't have much of a choice.": 1, "Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research...": 1, "Well, can't say exactly where the mold is, but something does spring to mind.": 1, "Well, before we spoke to my mother in the Soul Cairn, I would have said we bring the bow to my father.": 1, "Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted.": 1, "Well, before he ran off, he was talking some nonsense about trying to fence goods to the rieklings at Castle Karstaag.": 1, "Well, back before I... you know. The College of Winterhold was the first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing.": 1, "Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry.": 1, "Well, at least you're smart enough to want to learn more. I'll show you what I can.": 1, "Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time.": 1, "Well, at least we're getting closer. Let's go.": 1, "Well, Neloth's just going to have to wait. Varona went to Raven Rock to arrange for supplies.": 1, "Well, at least we can get back to work. But hazard pay keeps piling up, and this won't be getting any cheaper.": 1, "Well, at least it's handled now.": 1, "Well, at least if the other Nord returns, they'll take care of him.": 1, "Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight.": 1, "Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.": 1, "Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior.": 1, "Well, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink.": 1, "Well, as far as I'm aware it's the only one in existence.": 1, "Well, as I'm sure you've figured out by now, it's no mere coincidence that we're named \"Moth Priests.\"": 1, "Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel.": 1, "Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.": 1, "Well, are there any questions before we begin?": 1, "Well, all of the previous Apprentices have been accounted for, thanks to you.": 1, "Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while.": 1, "Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left.": 1, "Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work.": 1, "Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?": 1, "Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all.": 1, "Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!": 1, "Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe...": 1, "Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!": 1, "Well, I don't know. Everything seemed fine until that dremora attacked me. I only heard later about the gates from the other souls.": 1, "Well, I don't know.": 1, "Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us.": 1, "Well, I did see something interesting not long ago.": 1, "Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm.": 1, "Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true.": 1, "Well, I could use a daedra heart. Can't grow that in my garden.": 1, "Well, I certainly can't help any less than the Vigilants of Stendarr, now can I?": 1, "Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price.": 1, "Well, I believe I've discovered a new form of silence. Some philosophers postulate seven orders of silence, but I believe there's an eighth.": 1, "Well, I assume so. It cast a spell at me from some kind of strange black crystal.": 1, "Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?": 1, "Well, I don't take just anyone into the secret parts of the place I grew up.": 1, "Well, Deor and Yrsa are still young. In time, I'm sure that they will have many children.": 1, "Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor. ": 1, "Well! Finders, keepers as they say.": 1, "Well you'll just have to wait. Last time I brought his meal up late he asked if I wanted to be a part of one of his experiments.": 1, "Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say.": 1, "Well you know it as well as I do. Raven Rock Mine wasn't empty at all... it's still rich in ebony ore.": 1, "Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway.": 1, "Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me. ": 1, "Well yes, of course you had to go and mention that.": 1, "Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me.": 1, "Well would you look at that!": 1, "Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?": 1, "Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?": 1, "Well which is it? Look farther or closer?": 1, "Well what did you expect, Tolan? Didn't I tell you? Didn't I warn you this would happen?": 1, "Well, Carius was the Imperial garrison commander at Fort Frostmoth, but he died over 200 years ago when the Red Mountain leveled the place.": 1, "Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!": 1, "Well, I guess now you have one more.": 1, "Well, I guess you'll have to.": 1, "Well, I was only trying to help.": 1, "Well, I used to sneak out at night and try to tip over the big ox in the Gray-Manes' yard.": 1, "Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please.": 1, "Well, I think it's time I got back to my work as an alchemist.": 1, "Well, I think it's specifically the black ones. I don't know if the Soul Cairn takes just any leftovers.": 1, "Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something.": 1, "Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.": 1, "Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two.": 1, "Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind...": 1, "Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does...": 1, "Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind...": 1, "Well, I suppose I've seen everything I came for, and you kept up your end of the bargain. I promised payment, and here it is.": 1, "Well, I suppose I needn't wonder where he is anymore.": 1, "Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.": 1, "Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes.": 1, "Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it.": 1, "Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time.": 1, "Well, I hate to see it go, but what am I gonna do with it here anyway?": 1, "Well, I have these other ingredients for sale for now. It'll have to do.": 1, "Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?": 1, "Well, I hope you'll come back around. Looks like you might be just the thing we need to wake these idiots.": 1, "Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and...": 1, "Well, I knew something connected with Hermaeus Mora was spreading its influence across the island.": 1, "Well, don't just stand there. Go find me another steward.": 1, "Well, I know she thinks the world of you. ": 1, "Well, I might soon. Neloth does pay well.": 1, "Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?": 1, "Well, I never claimed otherwise.": 1, "Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power.": 1, "Well, I put up with you, don't I?": 1, "Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy.": 1, "Well, I know there is some danger, of course, but I didn't think it would be that bad.": 1, "Well, that's a different matter...": 1, "Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you.": 1, "Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it.": 1, "Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do.": 1, "Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time.": 1, "Well, not yet, anyway.": 1, "Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them.": 1, "Well, not so far. They think I'm a bit strange, but they seem to tolerate me.": 1, "Well, not exactly.": 1, "Well, not a great deal, no.": 1, "Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle.": 1, "Well, no.": 1, "Well, my pretties. What shall we do today? Maybe see if you can regenerate your fingers?": 1, "Well, my notes were in my journal, but you didn't grab that, did you? Hmph.": 1, "Well, my mother used to say that I was born an angry child.": 1, "Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master.": 1, "Well, my friend, you did not know Ysgramor.": 1, "Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on.": 1, "Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them.": 1, "Well, my boss wasn't about to let him get away, so we pursued... on foot, for three days.": 1, "Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.": 1, "Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but our clan's got a long an' proud history in this hold.": 1, "Well, maybe it really is time to resurrect the Dawnguard.": 1, "Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain.": 1, "Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.": 1, "Well, looks like you're fitting in well down here.": 1, "Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done.": 1, "Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted.": 1, "Well, looks like some other guests have taken over since my mother left.": 1, "Well, look. Kill me, you've killed one vampire. But if people are after me, there's something bigger going on.": 1, "Well, look who's back. You ready to finally help us take out those Rieklings?": 1, "Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not!": 1, "Well, look who it is.": 1, "Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north.": 1, "Well, look what we have here... someone with flesh on their bones.": 1, "Well, now that's done.": 1, "Well, now. That's something to think about.": 1, "Well, that is what you hero types do, isn't it? I wasn't expecting anything less.": 1, "Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally.": 1, "Well, that depends on what you're looking for.": 1, "Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.": 1, "Well, thanks for trying anyway. Here you go... for your trouble.": 1, "Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day.": 1, "Well, tell Geldis that Mirri says she really appreciates it.": 1, "Well, sweets are always good. Or a new outfit. Or... or maybe a wooden sword? All my friends have swords.": 1, "Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses.": 1, "Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back...": 1, "Well, somebody needs to get me a new steward. It might as well be you.": 1, "Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start.": 1, "Well, some necromancers believe they are the crystalline structures dotting the Soul Cairn.": 1, "Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil.": 1, "Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see.": 1, "Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city. ": 1, "Well, seems like you have a bit of gold left in your pockets, don't you, my friend?  Mmm, yes...": 1, "Well, see what you can figure out. I'm going to inspect these pillars further to see if I've missed something.": 1, "Well, right. One of us will be a chief.": 1, "Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around.": 1, "Well, please let me know when you are.": 1, "Well, perhaps there's some hope for us yet.": 1, "Well, perhaps that is why you're merely an Apprentice here.": 1, "Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study.": 1, "Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum.": 1, "Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?": 1, "Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go.": 1, "Well, now... a fellow beast-blood. Well met, friend. Not many of our kind still hunt these lands.": 1, "Well, now. This I hadn't considered.": 1, "Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again.": 1, "Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!": 1, "Well, look what the horker dragged in. Still wandering all over Skyrim and causing trouble?": 1, "Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did.": 1, "Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl.": 1, "Well, if you do just let us know. We'll be in this area until we find them.": 1, "Well, if you change your mind, you know what to do.": 1, "Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help.": 1, "Well, if we keep having harvests like this, you'll never have to eat one again.": 1, "Well, if the shoe fits...": 1, "Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap...": 1, "Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?": 1, "Well, if it isn't the bully that goes around hurting people.": 1, "Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver.": 1, "Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine. Let Ulfric pillage his city.": 1, "Well, hurry up.": 1, "Well, hurry it up!": 1, "Well, here we are. Welcome to Raven Rock.": 1, "Well, here we are. We think.": 1, "Well, if you do, grab him and yell. Bastard stole from me.": 1, "Well, here we are. This is Raven Rock. Can't say I'm all that glad to see it again.": 1, "Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time.": 1, "Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms.": 1, "Well, he is the mayor.": 1, "Well, growing up the way I did, you get used to it.": 1, "Well, good. They're gone.": 1, "Well, go on, take it!": 1, "Well, go on! What are you waiting for?": 1, "Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.  ": 1, "Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours.": 1, "Well, first you'll need to obtain some Stalhrim, of course, and then you'll need to work it.": 1, "Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes.": 1, "Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order.": 1, "Well, explain yourself!": 1, "Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?": 1, "Well, he's quite obviously mad. Whether or not that makes him dangerous is another question entirely.": 1, "Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss.": 1, "Well, if you had learned to swing it correctly. A sword is an extension of the arm, not a meat cleaver.": 1, "Well, if you want to reach the summit, you're going to need some help. You... want a hand?": 1, "Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?": 1, "Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start.": 1, "Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process.": 1, "Well, let's see... travel-stained clothes, worn soles, blank and unintelligent expression... Yes, in fact you do.": 1, "Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging.": 1, "Well, let's move then. I'm nothing if not persuasive.": 1, "Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to.": 1, "Well, let's hope she makes it back soon. This lot doesn't have much patience with me.": 1, "Well, let's all raise a flagon to Ulfric; future King of Skyrim and bringer of poverty to the working class!": 1, "Well, let me think...": 1, "Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!": 1, "Well, let me know if you ever want to practice.": 1, "Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift.": 1, "Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite.": 1, "Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes.": 1, "Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food.": 1, "Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional.": 1, "Well, in any case, you still need to kill those bandits, remember? Then we can discuss you buying property in Falkreath.": 1, "Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.": 1, "Well, isn't this a surprise!": 1, "Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?": 1, "Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records.": 1, "Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm.": 1, "Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here.": 1, "Well, it seems the Dawnguard really is needed again.": 1, "Well, it started with the followers of Mehrunes Dagon having Emperor Uriel Septim VII assassinated.": 1, "Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold.": 1, "Well, it'll set the miners at ease. And hopefully keep them alive. But they won't be cheap either.": 1, "Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower.": 1, "Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately.": 1, "Well, it's all over now. Lieutenant said you could see the smoke from Whiterun.": 1, "Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known.": 1, "When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me.": 1, "What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!": 1, "What are you starin' at?": 1, "What? After all this, I can't even see him? ": 1, "What? A dragon? In Helgen?": 1, "What?  My Fjola would never...": 1, "What...hey! That felt good.": 1, "What...? Whoever did this is dead. You hear me? Dead!": 1, "What...! Do you know who I am? I should have you taken up and flogged!": 1, "What... what was that?": 1, "What... what happened?": 1, "What... what are you doing?!": 1, "What... never seen a Redoran Guard before?": 1, "What... have I done... Auri-Eil forgive me...": 1, "What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.": 1, "What, you still think it's funny?": 1, "What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?": 1, "What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!": 1, "What, um... What next?": 1, "What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!": 1, "What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself.": 1, "What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth? ": 1, "What's your wife think of your trips? ": 1, "What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?": 1, "What's your business here in Winterhold?": 1, "What's wrong? You have to look at the blood closely to see the quality of the meat. How else will you know it's fresh?": 1, "What's wrong, dear friend? You seem... distracted today.": 1, "What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.": 1, "What's wrong with you? Do you want to ruin everything?": 1, "What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.": 1, "What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since.": 1, "What's this?

I'm...I'm see through! This better not be permanent. You can't just go around making women invisible like this!": 1, "What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?": 1, "What did you expect? That no one was going to notice you butting into business that wasn't yours?": 1, "What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.": 1, "What did you need, soldier?": 1, "What did you say to me, Reachman?": 1, "What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!": 1, "What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat.": 1, "What did you tell them last time?": 1, "What did you hear?": 1, "What're you up to, Garan?": 1, "What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?": 1, "What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.": 1, "What was that thing, anyway?": 1, "What was it you wanted?": 1, "What was it like? Cidhna Mine? We've all been talking about your escape. And being pardoned after. Amazing.": 1, "What was it like killing your first one, huh?": 1, "What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?": 1, "What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what.": 1, "What turned him into one of the undead appears to remain a mystery for now.": 1, "What troubles you, husband?": 1, "What troubles you, darling?": 1, "What treachery?": 1, "What tortures did they suffer at Miraak's hands?

Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.": 1, "What the...?!": 1, "What now? ": 1, "What was that, Legate?": 1, "What was that? Some kind of foreign move?": 1, "What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder.": 1, "What're you lookin' at?": 1, "What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.": 1, "What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai? ": 1, "What'cha doing in Left Hand? Do you dig up rocks too, like my mom?": 1, "What! Who's going to make my tea?": 1, "What you've done for me... for all of Raven Rock... goes far beyond what I would have expected from a traveler to our town.": 1, "What you probably don't know is that he still grants it to his more impressive followers.": 1, "What you might not know is that for the most devoted and impressive followers, Molag Bal will give the gift anew, in its pure form.": 1, "What you learn here will last you a lifetime.

Don't do it again.": 1, "What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men.": 1, "What would you have me do, then? Nothing?": 1, "What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald.": 1, "What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement.": 1, "What would possess someone to give their allegiance to Hircine, only to see their free will taken from them like this?": 1, "What would mudcrabs want with my satchel, anyway?": 1, "What would Hroggar say if he heard I was drinking with you?": 1, "What with all the ash spawn on the road these days, I'm not leaving until the trip is worth it.": 1, "What will you do now, my love?": 1, "What will Skyrim have become if her children submitted to tyranny?": 1, "What who wanted?": 1, "What weapon do you like, Harbinger?": 1, "What we do know is that some are born with the special gift to read the Elder Scrolls.": 1, "What wasn't I clear about?": 1, "What was...?": 1, "What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?": 1, "What next? When will it stop?": 1, "What next, giant snakes?": 1, "What next, carnivorous rabbits?": 1, "What is life's greatest illusion?": 1, "What is it? I said I didn't wish to... be disturbed.": 1, "What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.": 1, "What is it, woman?

Walking around nearly naked...": 1, "What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects.": 1, "What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?": 1, "What in the world?": 1, "What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?": 1, "What in the name of the gods are you doing?": 1, "What in the name of the Black Hands is that supposed to mean?!": 1, "What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?": 1, "What in the name of Oblivion do you want?": 1, "What in the name of Azura...?": 1, "What in the bloody blazes?": 1, "What in Oblivion is that?": 1, "What in Mundus am I doing out here at this hour?": 1, "What if the vampires come here, after the Dawnguard?

Why isn't Fjola with you?": 1, "What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?": 1, "What news do you bring from Fort Frostmoth?": 1, "What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know.": 1, "What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide? ": 1, "What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere.": 1, "What makes you think I know anything?

I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself.": 1, "You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them.": 1, "You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny.": 1, "You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor.": 1, "You'll be a welcome addition to the court, I'm sure.": 1, "You'll also want to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do.": 1, "You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.": 1, "You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal.": 1, "You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves.": 1, "You'd think so, wouldn't you? I'm fine. Thank you for asking.": 1, "You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.": 1, "You'd think a vampire would be right at home in this place. You'd be wrong. Let's just find my mother and get out of here, quickly.": 1, "You'll be meeting my friend Arkay very, very soon!": 1, "You'd think Neloth was still a clan leader in House Telvanni the way he carries on.": 1, "You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.": 1, "You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue.": 1, "You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already...": 1, "You'd figure a couple hundred years locked away with one would have given me some insight, but no.": 1, "You'd do well to watch that tongue, elf.": 1, "You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.": 1, "You'd do well to remember who's in charge around here.": 1, "You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.": 1, "You'd do well to remember that next time, Attendant.": 1, "You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...": 1, "You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future.": 1, "You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose.": 1, "You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences.": 1, "You'd better speak to the Jarl, then.": 1, "You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here.": 1, "You'd better know what you're doing.": 1, "You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.": 1, "You'll be well paid for your time.": 1, "You'll listen to this.": 1, "You'll let me go. I know you will. This is all just part of the game we play...": 1, "You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.": 1, "You'll have to take it from me.": 1, "You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.": 1, "You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately.": 1, "You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief.": 1, "You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it.": 1, "You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus.": 1, "You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.": 1, "You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.": 1, "You'll have to fight me for it.": 1, "You'll have to do better than that.": 1, "You'll have to do better than that!": 1, "You'll be wantin' me to pay for them?": 1, "You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans. ": 1, "You'll have to catch me first!": 1, "You'll have shown yourself to be strong, which means you can't be allowed to just stick around.": 1, "You'll have a traitor's death.": 1, "You'll give that back if you know what's good for you.": 1, "You'll get the hang of it.": 1, "You'll find tonics, salves, poultices and potions on my shelves. Browse to your heart's content.": 1, "You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you. ": 1, "You'll figure something out. We must be vigilant and self sufficient if we are to defeat these monsters.": 1, "You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though.": 1, "You'll die this day, dragon!": 1, "You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.": 1, "You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?": 1, "You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.": 1, "You'll beg me to kill you before I'm done!": 1, "You'll have to come back another time. ": 1, "You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.": 1, "You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!": 1, "You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...": 1, "You would shut out the darkness?": 1, "You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.": 1, "You would leave me here? As a prisoner?": 1, "You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.": 1, "You would experience it as a sort of... increased vigor. You would fight longer, feel stronger, that sort of thing.": 1, "You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those.": 1, "You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.": 1, "You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help an old man.": 1, "You would do that? I know he would listen to you. You've been out there in the wide world. You know its perils.": 1, "You would dare show up here after becoming mortal, abandoning all that Lord Harkon has granted you?": 1, "You would dare call yourself the true Dragonborn?": 1, "You would dare address me?": 1, "You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!": 1, "You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.": 1, "You would steal from those who have so little?": 1, "You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours.": 1, "You work the forge.": 1, "You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us.": 1, "You won't. The Jarl has ordered a life sentence for you. Get comfortable in the dark, 'cause you'll never see the sun again.": 1, "You won't win!": 1, "You won't live to see tomorrow!": 1, "You won't like it, my lady.": 1, "You won't leave here alive!": 1, "You won't leave Skyrim alive!": 1, "You won't help me!?": 1, "You won't get that lucky again!": 1, "You won't get me!": 1, "You won't get away!": 1, "You won't get away from me!": 1, "You won't get anything out of me, you filthy sons o' horkers.": 1, "You worry about bashing people's heads in, I'll worry about the Guild. Okay?": 1, "You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?": 1, "You would?": 1, "You would? Oh, that would be wonderful.": 1, "You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor.": 1, "You'd better get out of that Stormcloak gear. Today's not the day to go around dressed like a rebel.": 1, "You'd better get out of here and get yourself cured.": 1, "You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!": 1, "You'd better be on your way now.": 1, "You'd best show us the proper respect, if that's even possible for someone like you.": 1, "You'd best find him soon. Ask him to change you back.": 1, "You'd best beg Lord Harkon to turn you at once. Although, you do smell delicious...": 1, "You'd become the very thing you've sworn to destroy. I don't know how the Dawnguard will react.": 1, "You'd be surprised what people leave behind when you burn their village to the ground.": 1, "You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.": 1, "You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.": 1, "You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!": 1, "You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!": 1, "You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.": 1, "You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?": 1, "You! Please, help me!": 1, "You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time.": 1, "You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve.": 1, "You wouldn't dare. Now shut up and keep on watch.": 1, "You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!": 1, "You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?": 1, "You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends.": 1, "You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it.": 1, "You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim.": 1, "You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.": 1, "You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.": 1, "You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics.": 1, "You! Back to inflict more pain on me?": 1, "You! Come on, into the keep!": 1, "You! Don't hurt me! Not again!": 1, "You wouldn't like it.": 1, "You won't feel a thing. But if you do, try not to scream too loudly. My ears are sensitive.": 1, "You'll make a fine rug, cat!": 1, "You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course.": 1, "You're certain we're ready?": 1, "You're busy. I'll come back later.": 1, "You're bloated with disease. The Vigilant of Stendarr can help you, as long as you promise to never assist the Daedra.": 1, "You're bleeding!": 1, "You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself.": 1, "You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.": 1, "You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?": 1, "You're back, good! So, what happened?": 1, "You're back! Great! Are we going on another adventure?": 1, "You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?": 1, "You're back and alive to boot! Fantastic.": 1, "You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?": 1, "You're asking for trouble walking around with dangerous magic like that.": 1, "You're an outsider. You're dangerous-looking. You'll do.": 1, "You're certain you've found it?": 1, "You're an idiot.": 1, "You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me.": 1, "You're always welcome to return here at any time, of course.": 1, "You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?": 1, "You're always a sight for sore eyes. Here, I've been hanging on to this for you.": 1, "You're also free to die for it.": 1, "You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?": 1, "You're already dead.": 1, "You're already as good as I am. There's nothing you can learn from me.": 1, "You're all talk.": 1, "You're all heart, Vivienne.": 1, "You're all heart, Kodrir. I bet Lady Mara is weeping a special tear for you right now.": 1, "You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?": 1, "You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again. ": 1, "You're alive. I hope that bodes ill for Ildari.": 1, "You're an idiot, Kleppr. Why did I ever marry you?": 1, "You're alive! I'm impressed! Galmar had his doubts about you, but I knew you'd pull through. You should speak with him. He's going to need your help.": 1, "You're cheating!": 1, "You're closer to understanding than you realize.": 1, "You're good as dead!": 1, "You're going with me, and you're going to make sure I don't have any trouble reaching that giant.": 1, "You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.": 1, "You're going to pay, outlander.": 1, "You're going to pay!": 1, "You're going to pay for this.": 1, "You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family.": 1, "You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.": 1, "You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.": 1, "You're going to go kill a Dawnguard spy.": 1, "You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!": 1, "You're going to end up helping me. I know it.": 1, "You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it.": 1, "You're going ahead without me? Suit yourself...": 1, "You're clear to enter.": 1, "You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.": 1, "You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?": 1, "You're doing your job, Adril. No one can fault you for that.": 1, "You're doing well, but two of the spires remain intact.": 1, "You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.": 1, "You're dismissed.": 1, "You're disgusting, stay away from me.": 1, "You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.": 1, "You're dead.": 1, "You're dead! Dead!": 1, "You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know a fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries.": 1, "You're damn right I'm interested. Question is, are you selling?": 1, "You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!": 1, "You're correct.": 1, "You're closing the stall, and that's final.": 1, "You're free to leave.": 1, "You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!": 1, "You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you.": 1, "You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.": 1, "You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.": 1, "You'll want the Bannered Mare. See Olfina, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.": 1, "You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.": 1, "You'll think you're best of friends, until you find his fangs in your neck.": 1, "You'll stay away from this cabin if you know what's good for you.": 1, "You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?": 1, "You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!": 1, "You'll remember the name Ancarion after this.": 1, "You'll remain mortal, but you'll find yourself weakened within the Soul Cairn.": 1, "You'll regret what you've done, murderer!": 1, "You'll regret raising a weapon against me!": 1, "You'll regret crossing me, outlander.": 1, "You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.": 1, "You'll pay off your debt to the Reach. Just work and you'll earn your freedom.": 1, "You'll want to talk to Legate Rikke. She deals with the new recruits.": 1, "You'll pay for your treachery!": 1, "You'll pay for this....": 1, "You'll pay for that!": 1, "You'll pay dearly for what you've done.": 1, "You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway.": 1, "You'll never be in charge of this family with that attitude, loving husband.": 1, "You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already.": 1, "You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.": 1, "You'll need to lower the water level before we can proceed any further.": 1, "You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave.": 1, "You'll need to do better than that.": 1, "You'll need to be luckier than that!": 1, "You'll need the cube I picked up to start all the boilers.": 1, "You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.": 1, "You'll need a cube to unlock this door. I hope you remembered to pick up the cube I placed in the pedestal.": 1, "You'll pay for your insolence!": 1, "You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.": 1, "You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it.": 1, "You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct.": 1, "You're a very pretty young woman, Rhiada.": 1, "You're a tricky one. Now fix it.": 1, "You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?": 1, "You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is.": 1, "You're a talker, eh?": 1, "You're a talkative one, aren't you.": 1, "You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle. ": 1, "You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.": 1, "You're a stranger here too, eh?": 1, "You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?": 1, "You're a real fighter. I like that.": 1, "You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?": 1, "You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit.": 1, "You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.": 1, "You're a good son.": 1, "You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us.": 1, "You're a good friend. Here. Take this. You'll like it.": 1, "You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...": 1, "You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...": 1, "You're a bad sneak. You're not creeping up on anybody like that.": 1, "You're a cold hearted bastard, aren't you?": 1, "You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.": 1, "You're a coward, Miraak! Why don't you come out and face us yourself instead of controlling our minds!": 1, "You'll meet a lot of tongue-wagging gossips in this town. Try not to take them too seriously.": 1, "You're a damn fool.": 1, "You're a dead woman!": 1, "You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.": 1, "You're a disgrace to your own kind!": 1, "You're a fool to fight me!": 1, "You're a fool to have become mortal again. I want nothing to do with you.": 1, "You're a good daughter.": 1, "You're a dead man!": 1, "You're hardly throwing her to the wolves. She just wants to see the world... just like I did when I was her age.": 1, "You won't even live to regret this!": 1, "You won't be intimidating me into lower prices. Put that thing away.": 1, "You there! Ah... citizen. This area is off limits.": 1, "You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...": 1, "You test my patience with these questions.": 1, "You tend to wander around, don't you? If you come across any stalhrim or ebony in your travels, bring them back to old Halbarn. Help each other out.": 1, "You tempt me mightily, Alva. But I won't cuckhold another man, even on murderer like Hroggar.": 1, "You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!": 1, "You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?": 1, "You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good.": 1, "You tell J'zargo when you are ready.": 1, "You tell Crescius he better give that pickaxe back to me, or else.": 1, "You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.": 1, "You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.": 1, "You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.": 1, "You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!": 1, "You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission.": 1, "You take care of yourself, now.": 1, "You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many made it out alive...": 1, "You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here.": 1, "You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.": 1, "You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.": 1, "You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.": 1, "You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.": 1, "You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me.": 1, "You sure that's power we're meant to have?": 1, "You sure showed Miraak who's in charge around here!": 1, "You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back...": 1, "You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!": 1, "You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.": 1, "You stuck in Raven Rock too? Horrible isn't it.": 1, "You stronger?": 1, "You survived! You have it, then?": 1, "You strong. Help tribe-kin.": 1, "You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?": 1, "You there! Traveler! Over here!": 1, "You think I'm afraid of you?": 1, "You think I'd have the audacity to place my own daughter in that tomb for the protection of her Elder Scroll alone?": 1, "You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?": 1, "You think I need to send Hrongar a stronger message.": 1, "You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.": 1, "You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?": 1, "You think I don't know that? If anyone learned of this meeting, my corpse would swing over Solitude for a decade!": 1, "You think I do this for my health? Come back when you've got the coin.": 1, "You think I can't tell my own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were open.": 1, "You think Alva...but that means...": 1, "You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others here. Very interesting.": 1, "You there. You another Imperial puppet? Answer me.": 1, "You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.": 1, "You there. What brings you to this place? Why are you here?": 1, "You there! That was uninvited. No more. ": 1, "You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.": 1, "You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter.": 1, "You there. I have questions for you.": 1, "You there. I don't think I've seen you around before.": 1, "You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?": 1, "You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?": 1, "You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here.": 1, "You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut....": 1, "You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission.": 1, "You there, hold fast!": 1, "You there, bring me another bottle of skooma... wait, who are you? You look like fun. Pull up a seat friend.": 1, "You there, boy. Stop skulking in the shadows and step up here. What's your name?": 1, "You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.": 1, "You there! You're the one they call Dragonborn?": 1, "You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!": 1, "You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against the growing vampire menace. What do you say?": 1, "You strong! All tribe-kin stronger with you.": 1, "You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.": 1, "You stop that! I will not be violated by some... half-Septim magician!": 1, "You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.": 1, "You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.": 1, "You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.": 1, "You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.": 1, "You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance.": 1, "You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.": 1, "You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.": 1, "You should speak to the Jarl if you need something, stranger.": 1, "You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family.": 1, "You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell.": 1, "You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison.": 1, "You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor.": 1, "You should see me when you get bored, stranger.": 1, "You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.": 1, "You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way.": 1, "You should run while you have the chance.": 1, "You should read the book again until you reach what appears to be the \"end\" - then you will have fully understood the knowledge it contains.": 1, "You should read it. I'd really like to see what happens.": 1, "You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.": 1, "You should probably speak to her.": 1, "You should probably put that away before you knock something over.": 1, "You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.": 1, "You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.": 1, "You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.": 1, "You should not have come here, vampire.": 1, "You should not have come here!": 1, "You should not be here, outsider.": 1, "You should never have come here!": 1, "You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.": 1, "You should listen to Mogrul.": 1, "You should respect your elders!": 1, "You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.": 1, "You should tell him to mind his own business.": 1, "You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.": 1, "You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.": 1, "You still need to prove yourself, whelp. ": 1, "You still here? Go!": 1, "You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.": 1, "You still got it, Morven... a salesman even beyond the end.": 1, "You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor.": 1, "You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will.": 1, "You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace.": 1, "You start flapping that jaw of yours or I'll start flapping it for you. You understand me?": 1, "You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago...": 1, "You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?": 1, "You speak to a Vigilant of Stendarr. Cavort with any Daedra, and we will hunt you down.": 1, "You speak to Igmund. Son of Hrolfdir. Jarl of Markarth.": 1, "You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal.": 1, "You speak the truth.": 1, "You speak the truth, Baldor. It makes my heart glad to see her keeping busy after Heifnir's death.": 1, "You speak in riddles sometimes.": 1, "You should try the venison. It's delicious.": 1, "You should warn the others.": 1, "You should've stayed in your precious forests, elf!": 1, "You should. I miss you. ": 1, "You shouldn't ask me. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. He's the one to talk to.": 1, "You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice.": 1, "You think I've got that kind of money? No, I only get paid on delivery. Can't afford to go out of pocket for a thousand septims on this.": 1, "You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place.": 1, "You shouldn't play around with magic like that...": 1, "You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College.": 1, "You simply need to retrieve the gem. The moment you touch it, your soul essence will be restored.": 1, "You skulk and sneak like a riekling.": 1, "You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?": 1, "You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?": 1, "You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.": 1, "You won't be laughing when the Thalmor come to root out Stormcloak sympathizers.": 1, "You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!": 1, "You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that.": 1, "You will find him on the deck. Any hint of treachery, and your life is forfeit.": 1, "You will die. And with the power of your soul, I will return to Solstheim and be master of my own fate once again.": 1, "You will die on this island, interloper.": 1, "You will die in terror, knowing your final fate...": 1, "You will die for the glory of the Dragonborn!": 1, "You will bleed!": 1, "You will be my blood offering to Morvath!": 1, "You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the tides of fate decree.": 1, "You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.": 1, "You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of.": 1, "You will be an offering to the Master!": 1, "You what? How could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough. Bah, just forget J'zargo ever asked for your help.": 1, "You what?": 1, "You weren't. There's just not much to it.": 1, "You will find the elf ship at anchor along the northern coast of the island. The one named Ancarion will have the map.": 1, "You weren't ready. You still aren't ready.": 1, "You were waiting... all this time for someone with my blood to come along.": 1, "You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.": 1, "You were told to find it, weren't you?": 1, "You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died. ": 1, "You were there for Roggvir's execution...": 1, "You were seen coming in. The girl at the door is a Forsworn agent masquerading as a maid.": 1, "You were right about this place. And about Mauhulakh.": 1, "You were right Galmar.": 1, "You were one of the Ashlanders, Elder?": 1, "You were no match for a Nightingale.": 1, "You were just standing there when you were supposed to be serving drinks to our customers!": 1, "You were just going to prove that you're Dragonborn.": 1, "You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there.": 1, "You were in Apocrypha. Or at least your consciousness was - your body remained here of course.": 1, "You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course.": 1, "You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing.": 1, "You will have the honor of bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.": 1, "You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!": 1, "You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble.": 1, "You wish to trade in Orc steel?": 1, "You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?": 1, "You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it.": 1, "You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.": 1, "You wish to do what I do? Very well.": 1, "You wish to be married? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times.": 1, "You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again.": 1, "You will?! Oh, thank you!": 1, "You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.": 1, "You will? Really? Well, okay, here's the situation.": 1, "You will?": 1, "You will. Until then, you'll taste every potion you make before you sell it.": 1, "You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you...   ": 1, "You will hear me out, then? Good.": 1, "You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.": 1, "You will serve me, willing or not. All who seek after the secrets of the world are my servants.": 1, "You will see them... wuth fadonne... my friends - Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir.": 1, "You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within.": 1, "You will release me - ro laan - if in return I promise to take you to Skuldafn and stop helping Alduin? ": 1, "You will pay for your defiance!": 1, "You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!": 1, "You will pay for Malyn's death, Azura worshipper!": 1, "You will not touch him.": 1, "You will not touch her.": 1, "You will not stop my plans!": 1, "You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!": 1, "You will not leave this valley alive!": 1, "You will not convince me to betray Storn's trust. Talk to him. He will decide the matter.": 1, "You will never enslave me again, Miraak.": 1, "You will stop... whatever that was - so that that evil does not swallow the Skaal like it did Storn?": 1, "You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.": 1, "You were given a vision? Are you serious?": 1, "You were given Namira's ring? A great honor.": 1, "You visit us often, Thadgeir.": 1, "You used to love finding new places.": 1, "You up for another wager?": 1, "You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.": 1, "You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise.": 1, "You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.": 1, "You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!": 1, "You trying to hide? 'Cause I can see you plain as day.": 1, "You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.": 1, "You treat a horse well, it'll take you to Oblivion and back.": 1, "You touch her, and I swear it'll be your fingers that go missing, you stupid Breton!": 1, "You throw a mean hook.": 1, "You thought what? You would skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.": 1, "You thought to reject me, and yet here you are. Your journey towards enlightenment has led you to my realm, as I knew it would.": 1, "You want Garvey. He handles the keys for the Warrens. About the only thing that disease-riddled native is good for.": 1, "You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!": 1, "You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend.": 1, "You think you have it bad? Try walking the Bulwark at night.": 1, "You think you can take me?": 1, "You think you can do what he can't, and I'll sell it to you. Then you're free to run off to him with it, if you like.": 1, "You think this is personal?": 1, "You think they turned him?": 1, "You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim? ": 1, "You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.": 1, "You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast.": 1, "You think running will save you?": 1, "You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?": 1, "You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar.": 1, "You think it'll work?": 1, "You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. \"Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra.\"": 1, "You think you stand a chance?": 1, "You want Thonar Silver-Blood. He handles all the family business.": 1, "You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this city.": 1, "You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me.": 1, "You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe.": 1, "You were at Helgen! ": 1, "You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?": 1, "You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work.": 1, "You watch yourself out there.": 1, "You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.": 1, "You watch yourself around him.": 1, "You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?": 1, "You wanted to speak to me, Elder?": 1, "You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.": 1, "You want to walk away? Fine. But there's going to be no justice for that poor woman. No one to care what happened to her.": 1, "You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.": 1, "You want to take revenge... on a god?": 1, "You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now.": 1, "You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.": 1, "You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel.": 1, "You want to know a secret of mine, young girl? The most effective poison to kill a man? A potion to make others fall in love, perhaps?": 1, "You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.": 1, "You want in, you need to cooperate.": 1, "You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.": 1, "You want me to close my eyes? Would that even things up a little?": 1, "You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.": 1, "You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.": 1, "You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?": 1, "You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.": 1, "You want to adopt one of us, right? I'm strong, I'm fast, I'm smart, I can do anything better than them. Come on, pick me? Please?": 1, "You want to fight? That why you have your weapon out?": 1, "You want to find him, try talking to anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big cities maybe. But you're on your own.": 1, "You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight.": 1, "You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts.": 1, "You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?": 1, "You want something?": 1, "You should leave. Skald gets upset around Imperials.": 1, "You're having us do neither, and I can't stomach it.": 1, "You're here to adopt someone? Really? Oh, wow!": 1, "Your blood will not protect you!": 1, "Your blood will flow in Miraak's name!": 1, "Your blood will be mine!": 1, "Your blood will adorn my blade!": 1, "Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.": 1, "Your blood is such a pretty shade of red!": 1, "Your blood is ours, Companion!": 1, "Your blood calls me...": 1, "Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help.": 1, "Your armor will look good on me.": 1, "Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!": 1, "Your actions show a lack of respect.": 1, "Your actions here have been a blessing to us all, serjo.": 1, "Your a hard woman to please Una.": 1, "Your blood won't bother me!": 1, "Your Voice is strong... for a mortal.": 1, "Your Shout broke whatever evil will controlled the Stone, and restored its true nature as a conduit of the All-Maker's gifts.": 1, "Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now. That's what I think of this \"deal.\" You killed my son! All of you! And now you'll pay the price.": 1, "Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service.": 1, "Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived. ": 1, "You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.": 1, "You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one.": 1, "You.... You'll pay for this....": 1, "You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...": 1, "You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?": 1, "You... you take that back!": 1, "You... you know too much. I can't afford to let you live.": 1, "You... you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell.": 1, "You... you have? Already?": 1, "You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.": 1, "Your Thu'um is weak, Dragonborn.": 1, "You... you did? He has?": 1, "Your blood, Dragonborn.": 1, "Your choice, friend.": 1, "Your family's success burdens you, does it?": 1, "Your false reign ends now!": 1, "Your eyes once were blinded.": 1, "Your existence is meaningless!": 1, "Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.": 1, "Your end has come!": 1, "Your enchanting has improved despite your best efforts.": 1, "Your efforts in Raven Rock have proven most invigorating for my husband. I haven't seen him this pleased in many years.": 1, "Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.": 1, "Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.": 1, "Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?": 1, "Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love.": 1, "Your deed was true, and so is my gratitude. Please take this in return for your efforts.": 1, "Your deception is useless. I'll find you.": 1, "Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.": 1, "Your death will not be that painless.": 1, "Your death will be my triumph!": 1, "Your death will be my gift to Auri-El!": 1, "Your death has been foretold.": 1, "Your death brings me honor!": 1, "Your daughters are growing up fast, Lemkil. Seems like only yesterday they were newborn babes.": 1, "Your crown... gods, it's made of Aetherium! Pure Aetherium!": 1, "Your crimes offend the Code of Malacath and we demand payment. Choose. Gold or blood.": 1, "Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!": 1, "Your contributions have earned you citizenship here, friend. I'll always consider you one of us.": 1, "Your contribution to our community will never be forgotten. Azura protect you, serjo.": 1, "Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?": 1, "Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months.": 1, "Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up.": 1, "Your coffers are running low, Councilor. At this rate, your treasury will be empty by next winter.": 1, "Your death will be swift!": 1, "You... you can't do this to me...": 1, "You... what? How could you possibly...": 1, "You... must be Dragonborn!": 1, "You've turned her against me!": 1, "You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift.": 1, "You've taken your last breath!": 1, "You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.": 1, "You've succeeded where I've failed by ending the threat to Councilor Morvayn's life. I shall not forget it.": 1, "You've simply used Serana in an attempt to take away what should rightfully be mine.": 1, "You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.": 1, "You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons.": 1, "You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.": 1, "You've served us all well, friend.": 1, "You've served Skyrim well.": 1, "You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.": 1, "You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name \"Gray Quarter\" is an insult.": 1, "You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you.": 1, "You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man.": 1, "You've ruined everything!": 1, "You've reached the Wayshrine of Learning, Initiate.": 1, "You've quite a keen mind to go with those steel nerves.": 1, "You've proven your worth, and I'm as good as my word. Take this staff from my personal collection. I think you'll find it useful.": 1, "You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.": 1, "You've proven devastating to their plans and they'd stop at nothing to hunt you down.": 1, "You've probably killed lots of vampires, huh? I'm sure Isran will sign you right up. Not sure he'll take me. I hope so.": 1, "You've picked one of the worst places in Morrowind to do that, but suit yourself.": 1, "You've nothing to fear from me. Please, we have much to discuss.": 1, "You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.": 1, "You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily.": 1, "You've not heard of the Gourmet? Author of \"Uncommon Taste\"? He's a wizard with a spatula. Well, not an actual wizard, but his recipes are legendary.": 1, "You've no right to be here, monster!": 1, "You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?": 1, "You've no chance against a true vampire!": 1, "You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?": 1, "You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware.": 1, "You, go pack your things.": 1, "You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting.": 1, "You... murderer!": 1, "You... liar... gah! ... I won't... not... for you...": 1, "You... didn't mean... yourself. You meant... Pelagius...": 1, "You... always say what you think, don't you?": 1, "You... You can see me?": 1, "You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?": 1, "You... Really? An Elder Scroll?": 1, "You. You're coming with me.": 1, "You. You strong.": 1, "You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.": 1, "You. You aren't with the Forsworn, are you? People say they saw you when the prisoners escaped. So many dead.": 1, "You. Who are you to approach the Jarl of Markarth?": 1, "You. What do you want?": 1, "You. Weapon. Put it away. Now.": 1, "You. Fol. Low. Me?": 1, "You. Fol. Low. Me.": 1, "You. Fol. Low. Me!": 1, "You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful.": 1, "You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster.": 1, "You, meat! Come, come.": 1, "You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable.": 1, "You, my friend, need practice...": 1, "You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!": 1, "Your family? You've poisoned the Reach with your tainted silver for long enough, Thonar!": 1, "You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this...": 1, "You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable.": 1, "You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this.": 1, "You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this.": 1, "You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped.": 1, "You. Come forward. I would speak with you.": 1, "You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.": 1, "You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you.": 1, "You've never heard of the great houses of Morrowind?": 1, "Your fate is sealed!": 1, "Your feeble attempt to hide is insulting!": 1, "Your words do me great honor.": 1, "Your words carry some wisdom. But if you truly believed in the spirit of Thirsk, you would have spoken them honestly.": 1, "Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.": 1, "Your wife, kidnapped!": 1, "Your wife is such a soul, and the stars appear cooperative. Now is your chance.": 1, "Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk.": 1, "Your voice drips with the venom of your mother's influence. How alike you've become.": 1, "Your visit here will be tolerated as long as you abide by our laws, otherwise you'll answer to the Redoran Guard.": 1, "Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.": 1, "Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within...": 1, "Your turn!": 1, "Your trickery won't confuse me!": 1, "Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn.": 1, "Your time will come.": 1, "Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King. ": 1, "Your time runs short.": 1, "Your thu'um is stronger than Miraak's. Vobalaan in. I serve you now.": 1, "Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss.": 1, "Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath.": 1, "Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.": 1, "Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.": 1, "Your suffering will be legendary!": 1, "Your stomach isn't my problem. We'll act when I say we do and not before.": 1, "Your staff... gods, it's made of Aetherium! Pure Aetherium!": 1, "Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.": 1, "Your soul essence was trapped inside a gem. When you and Serana entered the Soul Cairn, it was \"given\" to the Ideal Masters as payment.": 1, "Your soul belongs to Miraak!": 1, "Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better.": 1, "Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?": 1, "Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is... less than pleased at its loss.": 1, "Your time is at an end!": 1, "Your shield... gods, it's made of Aetherium! Pure Aetherium!": 1, "Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master.": 1, "Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.": 1, "death-dealing demon and dragon-killing King.": 1, "[coughing]": 1, "Zu'u uth nall thurri dein daar miiraak.": 1, "Zu'u unslaad! Zu'u nis oblaan!": 1, "Zu'u ni zaamiil. You cannot command me forever.": 1, "Zu'u ni zaamiil, Miraak! I am free from your service!": 1, "Zu'u ni tahrodiis. It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... vobalaan grahmindol. I have done nothing to earn your distrust.": 1, "Zu'u ni faas gaaffesejul.": 1, "Zu'u lost kriaan hi ont, nu hin sille fen nahkip suleyki.": 1, "Zu'u lost daal.": 1, "Zu'u fent aam. I am at your command.": 1, "Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can.": 1, "Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein.": 1, "Zok morokei! More souls to feed my master's hunger.": 1, "Your worry helps nobody.": 1, "Zok brit uth! I warn you, once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase.": 1, "Yyyaaahh!": 1, "Yuntar.": 1, "Yuck. Something smells.": 1, "Yuchaaa tungar cha tiweki.": 1, "Ysra, can you hear me?": 1, "Ysra, I'm here to help you!": 1, "Ysmir... curse you!": 1, "Ysmir's blessing on you.": 1, "Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!": 1, "Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death...": 1, "Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.": 1, "Ysmir's beard! She's...she's a vampire!": 1, "Ysmir's beard!": 1, "Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...": 1, "Zii Gron!": 1, "Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.": 1, "Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that.": 1, "Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.": 1, "Your life ends here, Vyrthur!": 1, "Your lies fall on deaf ears, Deceiver. The True Dragonborn comes... You are but his shadow.": 1, "Your lies fall on deaf ears, Deceiver! We know you are the False Dragonborn!": 1, "Your legend is lies, lurid and false;": 1, "Your lack of planning fills me with confidence. ": 1, "Your kindness will never be forgotten.": 1, "Your kindness warms my heart as sunlight warms the skin on a cold day. The Skaal are once again in your debt, outsider.": 1, "Your kind started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.": 1, "Your kind has no place here!": 1, "Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor.": 1, "Your kind are a blight upon Tamriel, monster!": 1, "Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.": 1, "Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.": 1, "Your invasion plans will fail!": 1, "Your life is forfeit!": 1, "Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear? ": 1, "Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!": 1, "Your ignorance of our homeland doesn't surprise me.": 1, "Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?": 1, "Your husband, kidnapped!": 1, "Your husband is such a soul, and the stars appear cooperative. Now is your chance.": 1, "Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor. ": 1, "Your heart is as cold as winter.": 1, "Your hands once were idle.": 1, "Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is.": 1, "Your guess is as good as mine. This place looks pretty different from when I was locked away.": 1, "Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.": 1, "Your friend, kidnapped!": 1, "Your fists speak louder than your words.": 1, "Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.": 1, "Your intentions are still somewhat unclear to me.": 1, "Your life is mine!": 1, "Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.": 1, "Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?": 1, "Your remains will be hung from the Bulwark!": 1, "Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering.": 1, "Your progress since obtaining my Oghma Infinium has been rapid. And now, I find you here, following in my servant Miraak's footsteps.": 1, "Your precious \"contacts\" have yet to conjure up a scrap of food or work for us, father.": 1, "Your powers are nothing!": 1, "Your power over others shall be great, like mine.": 1, "Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor.": 1, "Your pockets... they're a little low on coin. I can tell.": 1, "Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.": 1, "Your performance has been excellent lately Aia. You still need training but one day you will make an adequate singer.": 1, "Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?": 1, "Your payment, my friend. Well done.": 1, "Your payment, for a job well done.": 1, "Your payment, as per the usual.": 1, "Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud.": 1, "Your payment for services rendered.": 1, "Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you.": 1, "Your master cannot help you now!": 1, "Your mind was strong, but you're exhausted from the struggle.": 1, "Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth.": 1, "Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.": 1, "Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.": 1, "Your name?": 1, "Your fearlessness never ceases to impress me.": 1, "Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.": 1, "Your outfit is something of an open wound... where attire is concerned.": 1, "Your own fate will be your own choice. Just as always.": 1, "Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something.": 1, "Your path has brought you to the finest fletcher in all the land.": 1, "Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late.": 1, "Your pathetic powers are no match for mine!": 1, "Your obedience pleases me.": 1, "You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison.": 1, "You've never heard of House Redoran?": 1, "You've mistaken me for someone who cares about you and your problems. Find someone else.": 1, "You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.": 1, "You're right. I suppose the others can get by without me for awhile.": 1, "You're right. Follow me.": 1, "You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.": 1, "You're right, my friend. I just grow weary of the struggle.": 1, "You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?": 1, "You're right, dear. I'm sorry to worry you.": 1, "You're right, I saw it. Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all.": 1, "You're right, I saw it. But... how's that possible? Dragons don't exist... they're just stories from long ago...": 1, "You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.": 1, "You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?": 1, "You're pushing your luck.": 1, "You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice.": 1, "You're probably right.": 1, "You're right. It's mine. ": 1, "You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor.": 1, "You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.": 1, "You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?": 1, "You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?": 1, "You're out of your league!": 1, "You're only young once. Trust me, I know.": 1, "You're one of Namira's faithful now.": 1, "You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!": 1, "You're nothing but trouble.": 1, "You're nothing but a joke!": 1, "You're not worth it.": 1, "You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right....": 1, "You're not welcome here.": 1, "You're not welcome here as long as you're one of those... monsters.": 1, "You're not tiresome like the rest of the people I have the displeasure of dealing with on a regular basis. Here. I'd like you to have this.": 1, "You're pretty good. I don't think there's anything more you can learn from me.": 1, "You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness.": 1, "You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it.": 1, "You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?": 1, "You're the one that recovered the Staff of Magnus. Impressive.": 1, "You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before.": 1, "You're the one Mazzaka described to me.": 1, "You're the brute that hurt me before.": 1, "You're the boss.": 1, "You're the best! Can you be my mother?": 1, "You're the best! Can you be my father?": 1, "You're the assassin, right? Look, there's this Reckless Mage in the Frozen Hearth Inn, in Winterhold. I want him dead. This gold should cover it. ": 1, "You're the Dragonborn aren't you?": 1, "You're that visitor, been pokin' around.": 1, "You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.": 1, "You're talking to a killer, remember that.": 1, "You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.": 1, "You're sweet. And... I'm not stupid. I can see what you're getting at.": 1, "You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.": 1, "You're sweet to say that, but you need to sort things out on your own. It's not something I'm going to get involved with.": 1, "You're such a wet blanket, captain. Can't a girl have a little fun from time to time?": 1, "You're stupid. All we wanted was money! They're gonna cut his throat now!": 1, "You're stupid. All we wanted was money! They're gonna cut her throat now!": 1, "You're still alive!": 1, "You're still acting surprisingly sane, too. What did he have to say? He must have wanted something from you.": 1, "You're starting to make me angry.": 1, "You're someone who can get things done. I like that.": 1, "You're serious, aren't you?": 1, "You're right. You're right. Feller might be nutters, might not. But fact is, he needs help. I turn him away, what kind of man am I, hmm?": 1, "You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.": 1, "You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.": 1, "You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?": 1, "You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell.": 1, "You're right. Sorry to bring it up.": 1, "You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this.": 1, "You're not supposed to play with fire, you know.": 1, "You're not supposed to be here...": 1, "You're not short of guts, are you? What's your game?": 1, "You're making my buyer happy. Keep them coming.": 1, "You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?": 1, "You're making me angry!": 1, "You're lying. You're not quick enough to be a pickpocket. What's the real reason?": 1, "You're lucky to be alive, then. I'm guessing you don't have a plan for where to go next, then?": 1, "You're lucky the bounty on you is so low, otherwise I'd be hauling you to the Bulwark myself. Get out of my sight.": 1, "You're lucky Isran hasn't killed you outright. Get cured while you can.": 1, "You're losing a lot of blood. Maybe you should sit down for a moment.": 1, "You're looking hale and healthy. It's good to see you again.": 1, "You're looking for something, yes? The... Staff of Magnus.": 1, "You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.": 1, "You're looking a little rough around the edges. You feeling all right?": 1, "You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.": 1, "You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit.": 1, "You're making people a bit nervous. Should consider putting that weapon away. ": 1, "You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.": 1, "You're just rotten. No good.": 1, "You're just in time to say hello to Roggvir.": 1, "You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.": 1, "You're just getting older.": 1, "You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.": 1, "You're joking.": 1, "You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb.": 1, "You're interrupting the performance.": 1, "You're interfering with official Thalmor business.": 1, "You're in my home. That's right. This here place, Breezehome, it belongs to old Terek.": 1, "You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.": 1, "You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.": 1, "You're here! I was wondering if that Black Sacrament even worked. I need you to kill a woman, a Poor Fishwife, on the Riften Docks. Here's the gold.": 1, "You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay.": 1, "You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?": 1, "You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!": 1, "You're making this too easy!": 1, "You're married, yes? To that young metal worker?": 1, "You're not planning on burning anything with that, are you?": 1, "You're not paying attention then. Like most everyone else around here.": 1, "You're not one of my workers. What are you doing here?": 1, "You're not listening to me. I don't have it.": 1, "You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire.": 1, "You're not in here for life, like I am.": 1, "You're not going to kill me!": 1, "You're not going to keep me in here!": 1, "You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace.": 1, "You're not getting the best of me!": 1, "You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking.": 1, "You're not from around here. That makes two of us.": 1, "You're not from around here. I'll bet you're here to help with the war!": 1, "You're not at all what I expected. I imagined you'd be fatter, honestly.": 1, "You're not as dumb as you look.": 1, "You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine.": 1, "You're not afraid you'll set fire to something?": 1, "You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.": 1, "You're mine now, Logrolf.": 1, "You're mine, mortal!": 1, "You're mortal? What are you doing here like that?": 1, "You're my... friend....": 1, "You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side.": 1, "You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?": 1, "You're new here, right? Welcome to the Bards College. It's like a... musical museum.": 1, "You're no better than those thieving reavers.": 1, "You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.": 1, "You're no match for me, fledgling.": 1, "You're not a thief trying to rob me, right?": 1, "You're not a threat... merely an annoyance.": 1, "You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that.": 1, "You're new here, so I'll explain this once. You feed from the thralls as much as you like. You kill them, and I'll split you in half.": 1, "You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!": 1, "You're the one who returned blessed Sheogorath. I would be honored to be Wabbajacked by you, your grace.": 1, "You're the one with the staff, my boy.": 1, "You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.": 1, "You've gone from a between-meal snack to the darling of the court. Impressive.": 1, "You've gone far enough. Neloth is a fool to think he could send some low life to finish me off.": 1, "You've given up the powers granted to you? Get away from me. I don't want to be seen talking to you.": 1, "You've given me a great gift friend. The night air hums and the shadows are full of color.": 1, "You've gathered quite a few of them I see.": 1, "You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.": 1, "You've found the Wayshrine of Radiance, Initiate.": 1, "You've found the Bards College kitchen. Congratulations.": 1, "You've found her journal!": 1, "You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?": 1, "You've earned your citizenship here, and I hope you'll consider staying with us as a member of our community.": 1, "You've dug your own grave!": 1, "You've done your duty and we're all very grateful. Now... I'd like to eat.": 1, "You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!": 1, "You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother.": 1, "You've done well.": 1, "You've done well by restoring our Festival.": 1, "You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.": 1, "You've done more than enough already. You've been a good friend in a time of need, and we won't forget that.": 1, "You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information.": 1, "You've done it... just as the prophecy said...": 1, "You've done it. The shrine is ours again.": 1, "You've done it! You've beaten him!": 1, "You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work.": 1, "You've done it! That's all of them!": 1, "You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about.": 1, "You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it.": 1, "You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.": 1, "You've done a great service to the Silver-Blood family. I've had the Jarl officially pardon you, and taken care of a few other loose ends.": 1, "You've done well. I won't forget that.": 1, "You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn.": 1, "You've got a good thing going here now that you've reopened the mines. Don't let it go to waste.": 1, "You've got moments to live.": 1, "You've met both of my parents. They're both crazy in their own way.": 1, "You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives!": 1, "You've made a fatal mistake!": 1, "You've made Narfi so happy! Narfi now waits for his sister until she comes home.": 1, "You've left me no choice...": 1, "You've just written your own epitaph.": 1, "You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.": 1, "You've helped me, so I suppose the least I can do is find out what Isran wants. He's still at that fort near Stendarr's Beacon, I assume?": 1, "You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.": 1, "You've heard of the Bloodstone Chalice?": 1, "You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age.": 1, "You've had some luck with these things before. Do you think you could... go back in? See if anyone's still alive?": 1, "You've had more than enough. Besides, you still haven't paid for the last one.": 1, "You've got yourself a ship. We'll cast off immediately.": 1, "You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!": 1, "You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.": 1, "You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?": 1, "You've got to help me! I conjured an Ash Guardian and now it's running amok.": 1, "You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.": 1, "You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you.": 1, "You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid...": 1, "You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.": 1, "You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive. Come on!": 1, "You've got that fire under control. Right?": 1, "You've got some nerve.": 1, "You've got sixty seconds. Go.": 1, "You've got plenty of moths. What's our next move?": 1, "You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.": 1, "You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with \"The Real Barenziah.\"": 1, "You've got no idea. Half the men in Whiterun have proposed to me. Some were even single.": 1, "You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!": 1, "You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two.": 1, "You've done Lord Harkon two great services. Take what you've learned to heart, and be careful who you trust.": 1, "You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires. All over some prophecy that we barely understand.": 1, "You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.": 1, "You've already seen my father's obsession. My mother's not a whole lot better, but you'll see that soon enough.": 1, "You're... you're mortal! What are you doing here like that?": 1, "You're... you're a vampire?": 1, "You're... still alive. Cicero respects the Listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh.": 1, "You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her.": 1, "You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.": 1, "You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons.": 1, "You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!": 1, "You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.": 1, "You're welcome.": 1, "You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me.": 1, "You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.": 1, "You're welcome here, as long as you don't overfeed on the thralls.": 1, "You've already taken care of it?  Thank you friend.": 1, "You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.": 1, "You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!": 1, "You're trying my patience.": 1, "You're trying my patience, lass.": 1, "You're trying my patience, lad.": 1, "You're treading on Imperial soil! Prepare to defend yourself!": 1, "You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.": 1, "You're too slow and stupid to take it from me.": 1, "You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.": 1, "You're too kind to people, always giving them the benefit of the doubt. Don't know how you put up with it.": 1, "You're too good to me, Aphia. I only wish I could remain with you longer.": 1, "You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!": 1, "You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.": 1, "You're the one? From the... the Dark Brotherhood? The man I need killed is a Seasoned Hunter. He's just outside Falkreath. Here's the gold...": 1, "You're the one with the staff, my dear.": 1, "You're under the arrest, for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest. ": 1, "You've already turned down a job that I had for you.": 1, "You've arrived at the Wayshrine of Resolution.": 1, "You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.": 1, "You've decided to help?": 1, "You've committed crimes against the Dunmer people of Solstheim. What say you in your defense?": 1, "You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.": 1, "You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you.": 1, "You've come this far, and you've found several Elder Scrolls.": 1, "You've come for me, have you?": 1, "You've come at last! I knew you would!": 1, "You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid.": 1, "You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.": 1, "You've brought warmth to my heart, outsider, and I'm in your debt.": 1, "You've brought us quite the meal.": 1, "You've brought this on yourself.": 1, "You've brought so much hope to our people, we are forever in your debt.": 1, "You've brought Raven Rock back from the brink, traveler. I don't know how to thank you.": 1, "You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.": 1, "You've broken the Code of Malacath. Your choice - pay with your blood or your gold.": 1, "You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!": 1, "You've been a good friend to me. That means something.": 1, "You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?": 1, "You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try.": 1, "You've been digging around where you don't belong.": 1, "You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea.": 1, "You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it.": 1, "You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?": 1, "You've been given a great gift. Do not squander it.": 1, "You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible. ": 1, "You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us.": 1, "You've been kind, I thank you.": 1, "You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?": 1, "You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see.": 1, "You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.": 1, "You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?": 1, "You should leave. I don't want you scaring off my good death.": 1, "You should leave those books alone.": 1, "You should leave slogging around in the muck to us youngsters.": 1, "You dare fight a Dunmer?": 1, "You dare defy me?": 1, "You dare challenge a child of Malacath?": 1, "You dare bring me here? You must be punished.": 1, "You dare attack me?": 1, "You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!": 1, "You damn well better.": 1, "You cut these bindings this minute! You hear me? You cut these bindings right now! ": 1, "You cross the Thalmor, you pay the price.": 1, "You could, you know, let me out of this cage now.": 1, "You could try Drovas Relvi.": 1, "You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.": 1, "You could spend a hundred lifetimes searching my library, and you will never find what you seek.": 1, "You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.": 1, "You dare invade my home?": 1, "You could say that. I own the place.": 1, "You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?": 1, "You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.": 1, "You could have cleaned it. It's still bloody. Here's your money.": 1, "You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway.": 1, "You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm.": 1, "You could call it that. Didn't put up much of a fight but made for a tasty snack. A rich bouquet of flavors, I would definitely recommend it.": 1, "You could always go back and get my journal, you know.": 1, "You control nothing, mortal!": 1, "You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire.": 1, "You consider Restoration a valid school of magic, worthy of study, don't you? Don't you?": 1, "You complain too much.": 1, "You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.": 1, "You come out to the northern ashlands, you don't expect things to go easy, you know? But this was something outside my particular expertise.": 1, "You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything.": 1, "You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's \"Jarl's man\" now.": 1, "You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks.": 1, "You dare invade this Sanctuary?": 1, "You dare threaten me? For that insolence, I will flay the flesh from your bones!": 1, "You disrespect Lord Harkon by walking around here like that. Go see him at once, else you might find yourself in a cage.": 1, "You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries.": 1, "You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic half-breed vampire.": 1, "You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic being.": 1, "You didn't touch it did you? Well no, of course you must have! Did you attempt to wield it? And you're not dead?": 1, "You didn't need to leave so soon.": 1, "You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.": 1, "You didn't know? Hmm, I thought it was obvious.": 1, "You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter.": 1, "You didn't have to speak a word. I could sense it the moment you came in.": 1, "You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.": 1, "You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.": 1, "You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...": 1, "You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.": 1, "You dare summon me, Yamarz?": 1, "You did? Really?": 1, "You did? Let me see them.": 1, "You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok - the arrogance of his power.": 1, "You did it. There's the entrance!": 1, "You did it! You have all of my pages!": 1, "You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.": 1, "You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.": 1, "You deserve to be happy.": 1, "You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.": 1, "You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well.": 1, "You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.": 1, "You dare walk away from me? In my own hall, before my own court, you dare insult me?": 1, "You dare to question me? That insult will be your last!": 1, "You dare to interfere with me?": 1, "You dare to betray us, Illia?": 1, "You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.": 1, "You come do an honest day's work at my mill, and I'll pay you an honest day's wages. Then we'll drink.": 1, "You come back if you ever want some fancier armor yourself, now.": 1, "You clean out that muck?": 1, "You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.": 1, "You can't find them on Solstheim, but if you find yourself back in Skyrim, I wouldn't mind you bringing some juniper berries.": 1, "You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.": 1, "You can't defeat me!": 1, "You can't beat us!": 1, "You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.": 1, "You can't be serious.": 1, "You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least.": 1, "You can use the North Gate to enter the city, or you can hit the road. Your choice.": 1, "You can use my coffin whenever you like.": 1, "You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.": 1, "You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you.": 1, "You can try...": 1, "You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves.": 1, "You can't get blood from a stone, Mogrul. As it is, we can barely make ends meet.": 1, "You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly.": 1, "You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.": 1, "You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.": 1, "You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.": 1, "You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.": 1, "You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools.": 1, "You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn.": 1, "You can take it over my dead body!": 1, "You can still run. It's not too late.": 1, "You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak. ": 1, "You can see the book right here.": 1, "You can see it from here, though. The mountain just over the buildings.": 1, "You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon.": 1, "You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain... visitors.": 1, "You can prove your new allegiance to me, by delivering an important message to the Jarl of Whiterun.": 1, "You can thank me if it works. Until then, I'd head to the tomb and wait until your visitor shows up.": 1, "You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.": 1, "You can't get rid of me that easily.": 1, "You can't have them! Stay away!": 1, "You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it.": 1, "You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let her prove it.": 1, "You chose the wrong girl to mess with.": 1, "You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.": 1, "You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.": 1, "You cannot take this away from me!": 1, "You cannot stay here any longer.": 1, "You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!": 1, "You cannot hope to defeat me here.": 1, "You cannot flee me, Dragonborn.": 1, "You cannot escape!": 1, "You cannot escape the truth. You cannot escape the True Dragonborn!": 1, "You cannot escape the Dragonborn's justice!": 1, "You cannot escape me!": 1, "You cannot escape Miraak's sight!": 1, "You cannot best my magic!": 1, "You can't win this!": 1, "You can't hide forever.": 1, "You can't hide from us!": 1, "You can't hide, father!": 1, "You can't just leave me here!": 1, "You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me.": 1, "You can't kill what's already dead, mortal.": 1, "You disrespect our Lord by speaking to me instead of him.": 1, "You can't make me go back in there.": 1, "You can't stop the inevitable!": 1, "You can't stop the prophecy!": 1, "You can't take that!": 1, "You can't threaten me any worse than they have!": 1, "You can't trust a word that comes out of Vingalmo's mouth. Remember that.": 1, "You can't walk around here like some common mortal!": 1, "You can't shake us off that easily. Let's see what's here!": 1, "You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.": 1, "You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven.": 1, "You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.": 1, "You go make the draugr dead again, and I'll keep the rest of these n'wahs from running off.": 1, "You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right.": 1, "You go ahead. I'll talk to Isran in a minute.": 1, "You go ahead and see what you can figure out.  I'll look around and see if I can find anything of use.": 1, "You give the Ideal Masters souls, they give you powers to summon the undead. It's all very business-like.": 1, "You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he.": 1, "You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine.": 1, "You give me freedom from the enslavement of the Ideal Masters. Thank you.": 1, "You get yourself to Morthal at once. Speak with Falion. He'll help you. But go do it now.": 1, "You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay.": 1, "You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.": 1, "You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular.": 1, "You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?": 1, "You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?": 1, "You go on your way now, boy.": 1, "You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun.": 1, "You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?": 1, "You freed us from the dark dream, and for that the Skaal are grateful.": 1, "You found... how in the world...": 1, "You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first.": 1, "You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?": 1, "You found it? Ha ha ha. There it is. Strange... it seems smaller than I remember. Funny thing, huh?": 1, "You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.": 1, "You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?": 1, "You forget yourself, young one.": 1, "You fool. You don't stand a chance.": 1, "You first. Come on. Let's go.": 1, "You find some void salts and you bring them to me. I'll beat anyone else's price.": 1, "You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!": 1, "You fight worse than you smell!": 1, "You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?": 1, "You fight like a child!": 1, "You go on your way now, girl.": 1, "You going to be at the inn tonight?": 1, "You have a much better chance than I to make it through these traps.": 1, "You have a lot of nerve coming near me again. I'm still sore from what you did to me.": 1, "You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine.": 1, "You have a death wish or something?": 1, "You have a companion already. You don't need my help.": 1, "You hard of hearing? I run this smelter. And I'm late meeting our silver quota. What do you want?": 1, "You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.": 1, "You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.": 1, "You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.": 1, "You had your chance to talk!": 1, "You had your chance to escape, vampire.": 1, "You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.": 1, "You gotta talk to the chief. Rochelle.": 1, "You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...": 1, "You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.": 1, "You got what you came for, didn't you? Go then, back to your college.": 1, "You got no respect, strutting about with that weapon out, threatening everyone.": 1, "You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay.": 1, "You got it?": 1, "You got it. Horse, wagon and all. Plopped here without so much as a word.": 1, "You got guts walking around with that weapon out. Looking for a fight? Is that it?": 1, "You got business at the stables?": 1, "You got anything in here worth buying?": 1, "You got a briarheart? That's what I really need. Neloth keeps taking all of mine.": 1, "You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?": 1, "You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?": 1, "You gonna hurt me again?": 1, "You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested.": 1, "You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?": 1, "You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on.": 1, "You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?": 1, "You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.": 1, "You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes.": 1, "You face danger without hesitation.": 1, "You don't know the half of it. ": 1, "You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?": 1, "You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!": 1, "You don't impress me. So don't even try.": 1, "You don't have what it takes to kill me.": 1, "You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work.": 1, "You don't have to tell me that.": 1, "You don't have to say sorry to me. I just hope the Eight bring us more peace in the future.": 1, "You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract.": 1, "You don't have to live like this now, though.": 1, "You don't have to apologize to me. Just pull yourself out of this and let's find a home. Either here or up there, it doesn't matter to me.": 1, "You don't have time? Fine.": 1, "You don't have enough to earn my loyalty.": 1, "You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals.": 1, "You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.": 1, "You don't have a chance!": 1, "You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!": 1, "You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?": 1, "You don't believe me. No one does. They don't want to. I don't want to either. But I can't help it. They're in my head!": 1, "You do? Alright then, enough mysteries.": 1, "You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family...": 1, "You do that, and I'll make sure you're set up right. You won't be disappointed.": 1, "You do something out of line, I'll put you down.": 1, "You do realize these simpletons wouldn't know real music if it bit them in the britches, hmm? Very well. Your wish is my command.": 1, "You do realize there's only one way this can end.": 1, "You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.": 1, "You do not remember the Daedric Lord of the Orcs? The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse?": 1, "You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses.": 1, "You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah.": 1, "You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours?": 1, "You don't get a second chance with me.": 1, "You don't know what it's like, coming from a family like that.": 1, "You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.": 1, "You don't like the Nords? Fine. But pledging your whole life to killing them? That's just dumb.": 1, "You expect me to just hand you the map, so you can deliver it to the blacksmith and laugh at the foolish Thalmor you so easily outwitted?": 1, "You expect me to believe that?": 1, "You ever tried hunting with no sleep under you? It wasn't pretty. Now I can rest properly, it should all be going better.": 1, "You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask.": 1, "You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls.": 1, "You ever heard of Aetherium? A rare mineral used by the dwarves.": 1, "You ever hear of Ahzidal?": 1, "You ever have to farm land while there was a battle going on? I have.": 1, "You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.": 1, "You escaped Cidhna Mine? With Madanach? Everyone in the Warrens has been praising your name.": 1, "You ducked out of the middle of a conversation with old Mora himself? Mighty impertinent of you!": 1, "You drove them off? By yourself?": 1, "You don't!": 1, "You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?": 1, "You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.": 1, "You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?": 1, "You don't want to be here. No one wants to.": 1, "You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?": 1, "You don't look so good. Are you feeling all right?": 1, "You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.": 1, "You don't mean, a real, live...": 1, "You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway.": 1, "You don't need to say anything, father. I miss her too.": 1, "You do Kyne proud. Only one challenge remains. Go and defeat the troll champion.": 1, "You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?": 1, "You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again.": 1, "You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?": 1, "You don't stand a chance!": 1, "You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right.": 1, "You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I...": 1, "You don't think you can escape me, do you?": 1, "You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.": 1, "You have a problem with that?": 1, "You can play this game as long as you like... I will find you.": 1, "You can only hide so long.": 1, "You all right? You look like you might be sick.": 1, "You ain't made me that stew in a long time.": 1, "You again? I thought it was clear I was busy.": 1, "You again?": 1, "You again. What are you doing here?": 1, "You again. Guess you need another lesson, huh?": 1, "You again. Didn't I see you in Raven Rock?": 1, "You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.": 1, "You a pilgrim or just passing through?": 1, "You Vigilants were never trained for...": 1, "You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.": 1, "You Imperial bastards!": 1, "You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?": 1, "You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!": 1, "You allowed your fellow warriors to grow weak while the dangers around you mounted.": 1, "Yikes! All yours, my friend!": 1, "Yield, and I may still show mercy!": 1, "Yield!": 1, "Yield to me!": 1, "Yield or suffer!": 1, "Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are.": 1, "Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.": 1, "Yet another child has prayed to their mother.": 1, "Yes\u2026 master\u2026": 1, "Yes? Who's there?": 1, "Yes? What is it that you want?": 1, "Yes? What did you need?": 1, "Yes? No? Nothing?": 1, "Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.": 1, "Yes? Hello?": 1, "Yield. I yield, Stormcloak! The city of Markarth is yours.": 1, "Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed.": 1, "You already appear to have someone with you.": 1, "You already have children, don't you? I'm sorry, but I can't let you adopt anyone else.": 1, "You are a very welcome addition to this dreary place, my friend. I owe both you and Arkay a great deal.": 1, "You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.": 1, "You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.": 1, "You are a true hero. I thank you, friend.": 1, "You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity.": 1, "You are a guest in this castle at my pleasure. I'll permit you to stay for now, but you're of no use to me like this.": 1, "You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.": 1, "You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.": 1, "You are a blessing from the All-Maker.": 1, "You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.": 1, "You are Dragonborn, like Miraak before you. A seeker of knowledge and power.": 1, "You are Dragonborn as well. You too can wield this power, perhaps to a better end.": 1, "You appear to have something on your mind. What is it?": 1, "You appear ready for the Oath.": 1, "You already got what you wanted, you damn hound. This is your fault.": 1, "You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?": 1, "You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper.": 1, "You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.": 1, "You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools.": 1, "You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.": 1, "You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised.": 1, "You and Madanach are animals, and I'll see you both rot to death in Cidhna Mine for this.": 1, "You and I have business to discuss. Ah, but you have not yet reported back to Astrid, have you? Do that, and then we shall talk.": 1, "You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?": 1, "You and I both know we can't spare anyone right now. I don't care if you still have friends at the East Empire Company or not.": 1, "You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end.": 1, "You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?": 1, "You always brighten my day a little. Here. I hope you like this.": 1, "You also are Dragonborn. You also seek to learn how to bend the world to your will.": 1, "You already know as much as I do. And that's a compliment.": 1, "You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost colleagues and friends to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?": 1, "Yes... yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect anyone to care how I felt about her. Thank you.": 1, "Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what other lost treasures we might discover?": 1, "Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...": 1, "Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?": 1, "Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here.": 1, "Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War.": 1, "Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner.": 1, "Yes. I'm trying to summon an Ash Guardian.": 1, "Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.": 1, "Yes. I'm speaking of the Cliff Racer of course. Wretched things.": 1, "Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.": 1, "Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.": 1, "Yes. I once practiced my art in the salons and manors of Tamriel's great and good. Now, the scum of Skyrim are my only clients.": 1, "Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.": 1, "Yes. I haven't been idle while this fascinating madness engulfed Solstheim.": 1, "Yes. I have enemies. Legions of them back in Morrowind.": 1, "Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.": 1, "Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.": 1, "Yes. Hermaeus Mora is devious, but then so am I.": 1, "Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.": 1, "Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef.": 1, "Yes. Further. Into the bowels.": 1, "Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with.": 1, "Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.": 1, "Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.": 1, "Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.": 1, "Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.": 1, "Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College.": 1, "Yes. By destroying it, the vampires hoped to cripple our order's activities in Skyrim.": 1, "Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be.": 1, "Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.": 1, "Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe. ": 1, "Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.": 1, "Yes. He'll do.": 1, "Yes. It is.": 1, "Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong.": 1, "Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people.": 1, "Yes... here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes in this section of the city.": 1, "Yes... father.": 1, "Yes... I'd say if you know how to forge ebony, then you know everything you need to know in order to forge Stalhrim.": 1, "Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down.": 1, "Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.": 1, "Yes. Yes, I do.": 1, "Yes. Were I to simply lay down and die, it would not please Malacath.": 1, "Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have.": 1, "Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.": 1, "Yes. Vahzah. You speak true, Dovahkiin. Forgive me.": 1, "Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I want to see what you're capable of.": 1, "Yes. They swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until we were completely overrun. We never really stood a chance.": 1, "Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself.": 1, "Yes. These vampires are a new threat, and a truly deadly one.": 1, "Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.": 1, "Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future.": 1, "Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow.": 1, "Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death.": 1, "Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now.": 1, "Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really.": 1, "Yes. Our order was founded after the Oblivion Crisis. We dedicate our lives to facing the threat of Daedra wherever they appear.": 1, "Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead.": 1, "Yes. So now you don't have to go, do you?": 1, "You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.": 1, "Yes. That was a lifetime ago.": 1, "Yes. The Skaal also tell of the day when we must finally give up our secrets. When Herma-Mora finally wins.": 1, "Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics.": 1, "Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.": 1, "Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so.": 1, "Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers.": 1, "Yes. There are six sacred Stones - Wind, Water, Earth, Beast, Sun, and Tree. Through them the Oneness of the land is maintained.": 1, "Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing.": 1, "You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it.": 1, "You are alive only at my pleasure. Do not forget that.": 1, "You are an inspiration. Do you know that?": 1, "You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.": 1, "You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.": 1, "You better not be here to stir up any trouble.": 1, "You better not be gone long.": 1, "You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.": 1, "You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.": 1, "You better get used to this, Drovas. This isn't that unusual for Tel Mithryn.": 1, "You better get that armor on. Give that sword a few swings, too.": 1, "You better get some gear.": 1, "You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.": 1, "You better be careful with that magic, if you know what's good for you.": 1, "You betrayed us!": 1, "You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive.": 1, "You bend to me?": 1, "You better watch your ass around here.": 1, "You belong to Hircine now!": 1, "You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.": 1, "You been talking to those Companions?": 1, "You beasts are the worst. ": 1, "You assured me that you could find it, however.": 1, "You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard the exit.": 1, "You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me...": 1, "You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?": 1, "You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.": 1, "You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea.": 1, "You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children.": 1, "You ask a lot of questions for a mercenary.  Just get in there and open the gate, we'll try and provide help once that's done.": 1, "You arrived just in time. I think those vampires were getting hungry.": 1, "You aren't worth my time. Piss off.": 1, "You aren't the first one to have gotten this far. You won't be the last.": 1, "You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!": 1, "You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?": 1, "You better. I hate people who waste my time.": 1, "You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.": 1, "You can offer, but I may not buy.": 1, "You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.": 1, "You can leave if you like. I think I'll be safe now.": 1, "You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there.": 1, "You can have anything except the scroll of course.": 1, "You can go where you please, but I'd stay inside the Bulwark if I were you.": 1, "You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay.": 1, "You can get out there and start making a name for us again... make them start fearing us like they did long ago.": 1, "You can find some in Raven Rock Mine, as well as that new source of Stalhrim on the map you recovered from the elves.": 1, "You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting.": 1, "You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again.": 1, "You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away.": 1, "You call yourself a wizard? I challenge you to a duel!": 1, "You call yourself a Nord?": 1, "You better... kill me... while you have the chance.": 1, "You call this a fight?": 1, "You brought this thing into our village. I do not know why Storn trusted you, but he did. Make sure he did not die for nothing.": 1, "You brought this on yourself!": 1, "You brought this on us! You!": 1, "You brought that up before... I think I was a little short with you.": 1, "You bring, he follow you. Yes?": 1, "You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.": 1, "You bring redgrass, we dance.": 1, "You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub.": 1, "You bring a smile to this one's eyes and peace to his heart. Take this. A small token of appreciation.": 1, "You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say.": 1, "You break it, you buy it.": 1, "You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?": 1, "You blood will not protect you from me.": 1, "You blind, girl? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.": 1, "You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.": 1, "You aren't here with bad news regarding my husband, are you? I couldn't bear it.": 1, "You aren't going to pass. You're going to give me everything you have. Whether you leave here in one piece is up to you.": 1, "You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn.": 1, "You are not worthy of Sovngarde!": 1, "You are no match for my magic!": 1, "You are no match for me, joor!": 1, "You are no match for me, dragon!": 1, "You are no match for me, Dovahkiin.": 1, "You are new, yes?": 1, "You are new here. I don't trust the new.": 1, "You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken.": 1, "You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it?": 1, "You are looking after your brother, yes?": 1, "You are likely better informed than I.": 1, "You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.": 1, "You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.": 1, "You are interfering with official Thalmor business. You will leave immediately if you value your well-being.": 1, "You are not worthy!": 1, "You are interfering in Imperial business. Yeah, so you'll have to pay us a fine... of say, 100 gold. Pay up, citizen.": 1, "You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?": 1, "You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against the Empire.": 1, "You are going to brew a new batch of ale, right? Like we talked about? What we have's been sitting in that barrel for over a month.": 1, "You are free to leave.": 1, "You are following in the footsteps of my servant Miraak. Like him, you are Dragonborn, and seek the power that is your birthright.": 1, "You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? ": 1, "You are excused.": 1, "You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?": 1, "You are correct.": 1, "You are brave. Balaan hokoron. Your defeat brings me honor.": 1, "You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission.": 1, "You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!": 1, "You are banished!": 1, "You are an outsider, and I don't know if I can make you understand. I will try.": 1, "You are in my power here.": 1, "You are not worthy.": 1, "You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion.": 1, "You are on the right path, and you will prevail.": 1, "You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.": 1, "You aren't angry about it, right?": 1, "You are? Very good.... may I see it?": 1, "You are?": 1, "You are, are you?": 1, "You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.": 1, "You are worth very little if you're not one of us.": 1, "You are without courage!": 1, "You are welcome here... for now.": 1, "You are welcome among us, so long as you mean no harm.": 1, "You are weak, mortal.": 1, "You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now.": 1, "You are troubled, Gorm.": 1, "You are trespassing here. I strongly suggest you move along.": 1, "You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my hands.": 1, "You are too young to remember the Nerevarine. He defeated Dagoth Ur and saved us all from the blight.": 1, "You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor.": 1, "You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzah ol aar. A fine slave you would have made.": 1, "You are prey, like all mortals. I banish you!": 1, "You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken.": 1, "You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur.": 1, "You are strong, Dovahkiin. Rinik mul. But not strong enough.": 1, "You are testing my patience.": 1, "You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?": 1, "You are the Dovahkiin, the Dragonborn. You may not be one of us in body, but you have earned the right to bear this title.": 1, "You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting...": 1, "You are the new Master; we bow to your power. A power which, I note, includes Auriel's Bow.": 1, "You are the one.": 1, "You are the true Dragonborn.": 1, "You are to destroy the feral creature before this small problem becomes a larger one.": 1, "You are to make a public show of murdering someone. Do it in the streets for all to see. The higher the profile the better.": 1, "You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!": 1, "You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.": 1, "You have a visitor.": 1, "You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.": 1, "You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events.": 1, "You must understand that, for the Skaal, life is a constant hardship. We take nothing for granted. We cannot afford to.": 1, "You must understand that he's no longer the man I married all that time ago.": 1, "You must talk to Storn, then. As shaman, he is the keeper of such lore.": 1, "You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now.": 1, "You must speak with the Farmhand at Chillfurrow farm.": 1, "You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.": 1, "You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover.": 1, "You must realize what a great honor this is. For the Night Mother to have chosen you... I am just in awe. You have Cicero's utmost confidence!": 1, "You must listen to me!": 1, "You must leave this place!": 1, "You must kill...": 1, "You must help us appease Malacath.": 1, "You must help me find my Arvak. He doesn't deserve to be in a place like this!": 1, "You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.": 1, "You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude.": 1, "You must have a death wish.": 1, "You must go, outsider.": 1, "You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open.": 1, "You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it.": 1, "You must go to Saering's Watch. Learn there the word that Miraak learned long ago, and use that knowledge on the Wind Stone.": 1, "You must first prove your worth, and then I shall lead you across.": 1, "You must first prove you are in control.": 1, "You must find out how he does this, before he regains his strength and returns.": 1, "You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!": 1, "You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.": 1, "You must fight him!": 1, "You must fight against what is controlling you!": 1, "You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.": 1, "You must either be crazy or supremely confident to go walking around with no clothes on...": 1, "You must have left a cube in one of the pump control pedestals. If you remove it, the pumps will stop and we'll be able to swim up there.": 1, "You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.": 1, "You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned.": 1, "You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain.": 1, "You need to start the four boilers. Then we should be able to open the book's protective case upstairs.": 1, "You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.": 1, "You need to not bother me.": 1, "You need to locate the tallest of the rocky spires that surround these ruins.": 1, "You need to leave? Alright.": 1, "You need to leave.": 1, "You need to learn some manners!": 1, "You need to hear this!": 1, "You need to go inside, little cub.": 1, "You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best.": 1, "You need to get cured, friend. You're a danger to the Dawnguard otherwise.": 1, "You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave.": 1, "You need to either help us or stop coming around here.": 1, "You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again.": 1, "You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned.": 1, "You need to choose between those two boys. It ain't fair to Sven or Faendal to keep tuggin' on their heart strings like that.": 1, "You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days.": 1, "You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol.": 1, "You need something? I am happy to help, if I can.": 1, "You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me.": 1, "You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?": 1, "You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you.": 1, "You need some armor, outlander?": 1, "You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.": 1, "You need but ask.": 1, "You need anything, talk to Master Dreth.": 1, "You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet.": 1, "You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask.": 1, "You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?": 1, "You need a reliable horse in the Reach. That's what we have.": 1, "You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.": 1, "You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne.": 1, "You must cleanse the other Stones so that I can draw power from the All-Maker.": 1, "You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back.": 1, "You mean... there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin, everyone is dead, the Family...": 1, "You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?": 1, "You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?": 1, "You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?": 1, "You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen.": 1, "You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really.": 1, "You mean the inn, or Winterhold?": 1, "You mean nothing!": 1, "You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing.": 1, "You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.": 1, "You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude.": 1, "You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?": 1, "You may want to be careful down here... the Thieves Guild makes the Ratway it's home.": 1, "You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences.": 1, "You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?": 1, "You may not be dovah, but the defeat of Alduin earns you the right of title.": 1, "You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.": 1, "You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foes, but you are not their equal!": 1, "You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge.": 1, "You may have everyone fooled, but I see what you're doing here. The call of gold sends you scurrying like a rat.": 1, "You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.": 1, "You may go now...": 1, "You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.": 1, "You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here.": 1, "You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.": 1, "You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?": 1, "You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets.": 1, "You may be able to break the hold on our people there, and free them from control.": 1, "You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold.": 1, "You may as well give up, I see you there.": 1, "You may need to pick away at it to pry the heart stone itself loose, but you look... strong. ": 1, "You meet your end, mortal.": 1, "You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.": 1, "You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.": 1, "You must be very skilled with magic, yes?": 1, "You must be using quite a bit of your raw materials repairing their weapons and armor. I'm sorry we can't compensate you.": 1, "You must be the... assassin. I need you to kill the Itinerant Lumberjack, in Morthal, at the logging camp. Here, this is all the gold I have. ": 1, "You must be starving. Here, spend it well.": 1, "You must be one of those wizards. From the College in Winterhold.": 1, "You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?": 1, "You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude.": 1, "You must be new around here. Bad manners to ask such a direct question, at one of Elenwen's little soirees.": 1, "You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum.": 1, "You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.": 1, "You must be clever. Find a way not to be caught or accused of murder.": 1, "You must be another pilgrim on the way up to High Hrothgar. No other reason to pass through here.": 1, "You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people.": 1, "You monster!  I'll kill you for this!": 1, "You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck.": 1, "You mistake me. I'm not saying no - just wondering about your intentions.": 1, "You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.": 1, "You met Stalf and Salonia, I assume? Lord Harkon and I suspected they might follow you there.": 1, "You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge.": 1, "You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.": 1, "You might ask my apprentice Drovas. Lately he seems to be hard up for coin.": 1, "You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience.": 1, "You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful.": 1, "You need to stay inside the boundaries.": 1, "You might consider putting on... something. Anything.": 1, "You might find a few others. Strays. Lone hunters. But ours is the last true pack that remains.": 1, "You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you.": 1, "You might look around a bit. Maybe one of our predecessors still has a clue.": 1, "You might make a decent Companion yet.": 1, "You might think it's all perfume and roses now that the mine's open, but all I see is a new security problem on our hands.": 1, "You might want to rethink that. You're missing out on some wonderful opportunities, working in that bar.": 1, "You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.": 1, "You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.": 1, "You need to take better care of your sister.": 1, "You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night.": 1, "You seem to have lost the gift that Lord Harkon gave you. I suggest you tell him at once.": 1, "You seem to have escaped the fate of many who find themselves ensnared forever by the lure of his secrets. Or... perhaps not.": 1, "You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?": 1, "You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?": 1, "You seem tense. Join a booth and relax a bit. Or did you need another fix?": 1, "You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.": 1, "You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.": 1, "You seek my blessing for the leadership of Thirsk Hall? ": 1, "You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it.": 1, "You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.": 1, "You see? That's why I didn't tell you!": 1, "You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic.": 1, "You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasies, rumors. Impossiblilities.": 1, "You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out.": 1, "You seem to have lost the gift that has been given to you. Perhaps Serana will grant it to you again.": 1, "You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates.": 1, "You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.": 1, "You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic.": 1, "You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust.": 1, "You see, Pelagius' mother was... well... let us say \"unique.\" Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim.": 1, "You see, I'm a collector. Of staffs. Magical staffs. In particular, those made by Azra Nightwielder. ": 1, "You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella.": 1, "You see the Tyranny of the Sun as your chance at deification, and like Harkon you won't hesitate to destroy anything that stands in your path.": 1, "You see that green light? That comes from the Wind Stone, where my people work against their will.": 1, "You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.": 1, "You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?": 1, "You see a lever anywhere?": 1, "You saved us! But from what? Is it truly over?": 1, "You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.": 1, "You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were \"waiting\" for someone to try and take the Lexicon.": 1, "You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim.": 1, "You risked your life to save Baldor. Your name will be honored in our village.": 1, "You seem uncomfortable being here.": 1, "You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.": 1, "You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?": 1, "You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.": 1, "You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.": 1, "You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.": 1, "You should have run away.": 1, "You should have known better.": 1, "You should have kept running.": 1, "You should have heeded our warnings.": 1, "You should have acted. They\u2019re already here.": 1, "You should go into town and talk to an elf named Nelacar. He was involved in the whole mess.": 1, "You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.": 1, "You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens.": 1, "You should come, too.": 1, "You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.": 1, "You serve your time by digging. So dig.": 1, "You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.": 1, "You should bring this information to Captain Veleth as soon as possible.": 1, "You should be talking to my Steward.": 1, "You should be more careful with your spell casting.": 1, "You should be more careful with those flames.": 1, "You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear.": 1, "You should be more careful about the women you spend time with in port. Come back later and it will be ready.": 1, "You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.": 1, "You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube I gave you.": 1, "You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.": 1, "You should ask around at The Retching Netch.": 1, "You shoe that gelding, boy?": 1, "You shall not stand in the way of the true Dragonborn's return. He comes soon, and we shall offer him your heart!": 1, "You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy.": 1, "You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.": 1, "You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.": 1, "You risked everything to get Auri-El's Bow, and in turn, you've restored the Chantry.": 1, "You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry.": 1, "You return, foolish mortal?": 1, "You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal.": 1, "You poor thing. Here you are.": 1, "You pledge your soul to me?": 1, "You please me, champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded.": 1, "You play so well.": 1, "You planning on using that weapon?": 1, "You planning on sticking around for a while? Think about ways to make yourself useful. ": 1, "You plan to march on Windhelm?": 1, "You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman.": 1, "You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.": 1, "You performed your duties to the letter.": 1, "You people and your damn Jarls.": 1, "You pathetic weakling!": 1, "You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off.": 1, "You probably want someone else. I'm just the stable boy.": 1, "You out here for a reason?": 1, "You only use the little swords.": 1, "You only face failure once more...": 1, "You only delay the inevitable.": 1, "You one of those \"Skyrim for the Nords\" types?": 1, "You once told me you did not believe in destiny.": 1, "You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.": 1, "You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives.": 1, "You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?": 1, "You never talk much about yourself, do you Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side, and I think I barely know you.": 1, "You never heard of them?": 1, "You never disappoint. What've you got there?": 1, "You never can tell.": 1, "You never asked me if hiding me in that tomb was the best course of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly.": 1, "You needed to know more?": 1, "You ought to cover your... unmentionables.": 1, "You probably weren't expecting to see me again.": 1, "You promised me you'd sweep the entranceway.": 1, "You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother.": 1, "You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?": 1, "You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.": 1, "You remind me of the Shadowscales, from the old histories.": 1, "You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.": 1, "You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!": 1, "You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora has scattered throughout the world?": 1, "You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.": 1, "You reek of death, my friend. I salute you.": 1, "You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.": 1, "You really thought you could get away with it?": 1, "You really think we can kill a dragon?": 1, "You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?": 1, "You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?": 1, "You really shouldn't be in here.": 1, "You really should put on some clothes, you know.": 1, "You really should be more careful with the spells you cast.": 1, "You really ought to become one of us again. Bad for your health, otherwise.": 1, "You puny weakling!": 1, "You ready to die today? Huh?": 1, "You ready to get going?": 1, "You ready to head inside?": 1, "You ready to hear me out?": 1, "You ready to take the Oath?": 1, "You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.": 1, "You ready, auxiliary?": 1, "You realize it's not really necessary to take on that form here.": 1, "You realize that doesn't impress anyone here.": 1, "You realize this is exactly what they wanted.": 1, "You really don't know anything about this, do you?": 1, "You really don't look well. Have you talked to Florentius? Maybe he can help you.": 1, "You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger.": 1, "You ready?": 1, "You managed to destroy all three Keepers? Very impressive.": 1, "You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you.": 1, "You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use.": 1, "You haven't seen Crescius Caerellius have you? That foolish old man's taken my pickaxe again!": 1, "You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.": 1, "You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.": 1, "You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?": 1, "You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive...": 1, "You have?": 1, "You have yourself a bet.": 1, "You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.": 1, "You have your orders, soldier.": 1, "You have worked here in the Treasury House for a long time, haven't you Ildene?": 1, "You have won a mighty victory. Sahrot krongrah - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see.": 1, "You have what you came for. Now leave.": 1, "You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to.": 1, "You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money.": 1, "You haven't seen a sack full of dwarven gyros lying around, have you? I'd swear I left it right here.": 1, "You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.": 1, "You have to let me out. They're going to do something awful to me!": 1, "You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.": 1, "You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you.": 1, "You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.": 1, "You have to help me, they are going to kill me!": 1, "You have to find the way out first. Good luck with that.": 1, "You have the ring. All you have to do is pick Brand-Shei's pocket and plant it there.": 1, "You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.": 1, "You have the heart of a great bear, as well as a wolf's cunning.": 1, "You have the gold yet or what?": 1, "You have the claw. Oh, you have to tell Lucan at once. Hurry!": 1, "You have the bow... ": 1, "You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.": 1, "You have stepped on us long enough!": 1, "You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage.": 1, "You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?": 1, "You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?": 1, "You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land.": 1, "You just made the last mistake of your life!": 1, "You just let old nana know if you need anything, all right dear?": 1, "You just let me know what you need. I am at your beck and call.": 1, "You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to... frighten me.": 1, "You just enjoy the fresh air and leave the rowing to me.": 1, "You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?": 1, "You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.": 1, "You jest, but they've been able to avoid identification for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient.": 1, "You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?": 1, "You idiot. He said \"firs\" not \"furs.\" It was a damn logging caravan!": 1, "You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!": 1, "You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now.": 1, "You honor the Reclamations with your actions. This will not be forgotten.": 1, "You here to attack me? I'm ready for you this time.": 1, "You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...": 1, "You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort.": 1, "You here for the Skooma? Head around inside, there's a trap door that'll lead you in.": 1, "You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...": 1, "You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?": 1, "You heard the summons. What else could it mean?": 1, "You heard the man! Drink and be merry!": 1, "You heard right. I'm glad word's finally starting to get around. But that means it won't be long before the vampires start to take notice as well.": 1, "You heard right! I said a dragon!": 1, "You heard me, captain- our work must not be disturbed.": 1, "You heard him. Go on in.": 1, "You hear that? The others must have found something!": 1, "You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a resource. You're an asset.": 1, "You hear any juicy gossip in town, be sure to share it with me!": 1, "You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.": 1, "You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.": 1, "You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals.": 1, "You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?": 1, "You have some tea, but I'll get you a fresh cup.": 1, "You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.": 1, "You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here.": 1, "You have made a grave miscalculation, and now you will pay the price!": 1, "You have left me no choice.": 1, "You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous.": 1, "You have kept your side of the bargain, now let me fulfill mine.": 1, "You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch.": 1, "You have it! The blessed Wabbajack! You must use it on me. You must.": 1, "You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.": 1, "You have helped me to see wisdom, and I thank you for that, Skaal-friend.": 1, "You have heard of the Gourmet?": 1, "You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible.": 1, "You have forsaken my gift. The ancient blood no longer flows through your veins. Don't deny it!": 1, "You have entered my realm. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained.": 1, "You have earned my trust, so I will share what I can.": 1, "You have many things I wish to buy.": 1, "You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well.": 1, "You have done the world a great service.": 1, "You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded.": 1, "You have done little beyond killing a few dragons.": 1, "You have done admirably, little one.": 1, "You have defeated dragons, yes, but still...": 1, "You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?": 1, "You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty.": 1, "You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!": 1, "You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow.": 1, "You have brought my daughter back safely, and for that I am grateful.": 1, "You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.": 1, "You have asked for my help. I am providing it.": 1, "You have an Elder Scroll? You?": 1, "You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable!": 1, "You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead.": 1, "You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.": 1, "You have my attention.": 1, "You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.": 1, "You have slain a great many dragons, I see. And yet...": 1, "You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way. ": 1, "You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?": 1, "You have reconsidered my offer, hmm? Onikaan kron?": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Winterhold. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Whiterun. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in The Rift. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in The Reach. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in The Pale. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Hjaalmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Haafingar. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Falkreath. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have quite the bounty on your head in Eastmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. ": 1, "You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings.": 1, "You have prevailed. I can feel it.": 1, "You have piqued my curiosity, however. Please, do continue.": 1, "You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage.": 1, "You have my oath that I will not leave the village until my mother is ready to let me go.": 1, "You have my thanks, friend.": 1, "You have no authority over me, boy.": 1, "You have no business here, so keep walking.": 1, "You have no business with our pack. Begone.": 1, "You have no choice. You must complete your contract. You must kill me.": 1, "You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days.": 1, "You have no dominion here!": 1, "You have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield!": 1, "You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear.": 1, "You have no idea what this means to me... to my family. Reclamations bless you!": 1, "You have no idea.": 1, "You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.": 1, "You have not answered my question. Why do you need to learn this Thu'um?": 1, "You have no idea how good it is to be back here. Thanks for your help, friend.": 1, "You just said it yourself.": 1, "You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here.": 1, "You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.": 1, "You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?": 1, "You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I.": 1, "You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.": 1, "You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.": 1, "You look awful. Better not get me sick.": 1, "You look able enough to venture outside of town. Perhaps you could help me recover something precious that was lost?": 1, "You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.": 1, "You look a bit peaked. You sure you shouldn't be home, in bed?": 1, "You little twig. I'll snap you in two!": 1, "You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.": 1, "You like my chitin armor? It was specially crafted for me by Grendis Rolovo... one of the finest master armorsmiths in Morrowind.": 1, "You like living in this filthy slum, dark elves? Maybe you should go back to Morrowind, where you belong!": 1, "You like it?": 1, "You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.": 1, "You look like someone who appreciates nice things.": 1, "You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.": 1, "You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!": 1, "You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!": 1, "You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak.": 1, "You know... you ain't so bad. Here. Take this...": 1, "You know. Where do you get your goods? I am always amazed at how you manage to sell things so cheaply.": 1, "You know. We know. Come fight. We wait, but you, come fight.": 1, "You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there.": 1, "You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.": 1, "You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears...": 1, "You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic.": 1, "You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise.": 1, "You know, they say knowledge is its own reward.": 1, "You know, there might be gold somewhere in here.": 1, "You know, the lady who runs the East Empire Company Warehouse in Solitude... the biggest warehouse they have in Skyrim.": 1, "You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.": 1, "You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?": 1, "You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place.": 1, "You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help.": 1, "You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay.": 1, "You made it! And you've brought the shards!": 1, "You made it!": 1, "You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?": 1, "You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.": 1, "You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.": 1, "You looking for trouble? Stay out of my way.": 1, "You looking for something?": 1, "You looking for something or what?": 1, "You looking for anything in particular this time?": 1, "You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend.": 1, "You lookin' for a new blade?": 1, "You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?": 1, "You look worse than I feel.": 1, "You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?": 1, "You look suspicious. You better not be one of those damn thieves.": 1, "You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!": 1, "You look like the type who'd rather let your boyfriend die than fork over some gold. And people think we're heartless monsters...": 1, "You look like the type who'd rather let your girlfriend die than fork over some gold. And people think we're heartless monsters...": 1, "You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?": 1, "You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?": 1, "You look like you could use an ale.": 1, "You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?": 1, "You know, the Winking Skeever's not just the best inn in Solitude. It's the also the only inn in Solitude.": 1, "You look like you've seen your share of adventure.": 1, "You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?": 1, "You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.": 1, "You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends.": 1, "You look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.": 1, "You look sick. I hope it's not contagious.": 1, "You look strong.": 1, "You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something.": 1, "Well what are you going to do then, huh? Let's hear it!": 1, "You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice.": 1, "You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad.": 1, "You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks.": 1, "You know more than I do now. Arkay has us both beaten, but he's not giving up all his secrets.": 1, "You know it well. The speed and strength of the beast. The thrill of the hunt. The triumph of the kill. This is our purpose, our way of life.": 1, "You know how to throw a punch, I'll give you that.": 1, "You know how happy it makes her to play the village peddler": 1, "You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it.": 1, "You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.": 1, "You know him?": 1, "You know as much as I do. I can't teach you anything new.": 1, "You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!": 1, "You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.": 1, "You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.": 1, "You know I'm more than capable. Why are you bringing this up?": 1, "You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...": 1, "You know the old man doesn't like it. ": 1, "You know I did.": 1, "You kill the giant, bring me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it.": 1, "You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.": 1, "You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you.": 1, "You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.": 1, "You kept your cool and you didn't kill him. That's the mark of a professional thief.": 1, "You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely.": 1, "You keep your distance with that magic": 1, "You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.": 1, "You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?": 1, "You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.": 1, "You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you.": 1, "You keep it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've changed the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.": 1, "You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?": 1, "You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.": 1, "You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know.": 1, "You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.": 1, "You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?": 1, "You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over.": 1, "You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave.": 1, "You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold...": 1, "You know, an important member of society. Someone attached to the Jarl's court, a merchant, a bard, a priest, someone with stature.": 1, "You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs...": 1, "You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now...": 1, "You know, I've asked myself the same thing.": 1, "You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him.": 1, "You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust.": 1, "You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning.": 1, "You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.": 1, "You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing.": 1, "You know, I think you're right.": 1, "You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!": 1, "You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.": 1, "You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College...": 1, "You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy.": 1, "You know, Hulda, there's this lovely Argonian ballad I've been studying...": 1, "You know what this is? It's a lock. A 'Tonal Lock'. Simple, and very, very deadly.": 1, "You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.": 1, "You know what? I like you. You're not afraid to get your hands dirty.": 1, "You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come.": 1, "You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.": 1, "You know where to find me if you change your mind.": 1, "You know, my father collected exotic alcohols. ": 1, "You know where to find me if you need more.": 1, "You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?": 1, "You know why I'm here. The Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.": 1, "You know why we're here.": 1, "You know you can afford a septim or two.": 1, "You know you can't win, so all you can do is hide...": 1, "You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?": 1, "You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.": 1, "Well we showed them, didn't we!": 1, "Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.": 1, "Well uh, Endon is a silversmith in Markarth, so I just assumed...": 1, "Then root out the monster, and destroy it.": 1, "Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it.": 1, "Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.": 1, "Then prepare yourself to receive Stendarr's Mercy.": 1, "Then perhaps you do have business here... Forgive me. I'm Rakel, of the Frostmoon Pack. Welcome, sister.": 1, "Then perhaps you do have business here... Forgive me. I'm Rakel, of the Frostmoon Pack. Welcome, brother.": 1, "Then perhaps you are connected with him. The old tales say that he, too, was Dragonborn.": 1, "Then people stopped taking the threat seriously, the Dawnguard was disbanded, and the vampires came creeping back.": 1, "Then pay with your blood.": 1, "Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly.": 1, "Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since.": 1, "Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work.": 1, "Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.": 1, "Then my steward was killed. You had to find me a replacement.": 1, "Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.": 1, "Then my father's sacrifice... it was not in vain. He died to free us.": 1, "Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?": 1, "Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...": 1, "Then may the All-Maker give you the strength of a great bear and make your will as firm as stone.": 1, "Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!": 1, "Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.": 1, "Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.": 1, "Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.": 1, "Then let's get going. I want to get there before my father has a chance to track us down.": 1, "Then let's be off!": 1, "Then let them die with their false kings.": 1, "Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.": 1, "Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?": 1, "Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.": 1, "Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details.": 1, "Then my daughter is truly lost. She died the moment she accepted a mortal into her life.": 1, "Then it's almost over. We can finally rewrite the prophecy as we see fit.": 1, "Then stop wastin' my time.": 1, "Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth.": 1, "Then you know what a beauty she is.": 1, "Then you know that Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life.": 1, "Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master.": 1, "Then you finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way.": 1, "Then you are worth more to me dead!": 1, "Then you and I both have reason to see what lies beneath us.": 1, "Then why are you still talking to me?": 1, "Then when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei and leave it behind.": 1, "Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?": 1, "Then what are you wasting my time for?": 1, "Then what are you doing here?": 1, "Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!": 1, "Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!": 1, "Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.": 1, "Then take an axe and find a dead tree to cut. We keep only what we need in the village, you know that.": 1, "Then we understand each other... good.": 1, "Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how.": 1, "Then we have nothing more to talk about.": 1, "Then we got nothin' more to talk about.": 1, "Then we find out where she hid it. If she's still alive... well, as alive as she was before. Or is now. Or... you know what I mean.": 1, "Then we finally have them!": 1, "Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you.": 1, "Then train them. What are we doing here? We should either get used to staying here, or be preparing to retake the hall.": 1, "Then this will be over soon for you.": 1, "Then they should send one they consider worthy. ": 1, "Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.": 1, "Then there's Tel Mithryn to the east. The Telvanni live over there... sort of a strange lot, but since we're both from Morrowind, we get along.": 1, "Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients.": 1, "Then the rest is up to me.": 1, "Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite?": 1, "Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.": 1, "Then it's almost over. We can finally put an end to this ridiculous prophecy.": 1, "Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.": 1, "Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?": 1, "Then I suggest you \"collect\" it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts.": 1, "Then I should be able to open the book's protective case.": 1, "Then I see nothing preventing my return to Tamriel.": 1, "Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you.": 1, "Then I must do this alone.": 1, "Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me.": 1, "Then I don't have time for you.": 1, "Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in. ": 1, "Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!": 1, "Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout.": 1, "Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.": 1, "Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way.": 1, "Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay.": 1, "Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern.": 1, "Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love.": 1, "Their mine. The spiders are mine to control!": 1, "Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead.": 1, "Their job was to keep the Jarl's son contained within. They took it seriously, and served honorably.": 1, "Their hearts are in the right place, of course. But Isran and I were never comfortable.": 1, "Their focus will be shifted from us, giving us one less nuisance to deal with.": 1, "Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really.": 1, "Their defeat was merely a delay.": 1, "Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind.": 1, "Their collaboration with the Empire may have given them unrivaled political and economic strength, but their hearts weren't with the Dunmer people.": 1, "Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long.": 1, "Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready.": 1, "Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.": 1, "The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me.": 1, "The... the Gourmet?": 1, "The... Gourmet?": 1, "Their leader, an elf named Ancarion, has a map. He says that it shows the location of a hidden source of Stalhrim.": 1, "Then I think I shall see to the repairs. Thank you for your time.": 1, "Then I think we're done talking.": 1, "Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.": 1, "Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city.": 1, "Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.": 1, "Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.": 1, "Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn.": 1, "Then in House Redoran's name, you'll get your wish!": 1, "Then he turned against them, becoming something they feared. He was defeated long ago, but it seems he was never destroyed.": 1, "Then he found that prophecy, and... that was it.": 1, "Then go forth, child. May the enrichment of Auri-El strengthen your resolve as you undertake your journey to the Inner Sanctum.": 1, "Then get back to it, you lazy horker! The day is wasting.": 1, "Then come back when you've got that much.": 1, "Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds.": 1, "Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.": 1, "Then by my right as Jarl, I grant you a title to the land.": 1, "Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you.": 1, "Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it speed your journey to the Inner Sanctum.": 1, "Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it light your path as you seek tranquility within the Inner Sanctum.": 1, "Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.": 1, "Then I was wrong about him. ": 1, "Then I will keep practicing my aim every day.": 1, "Then I'll settle down peacefully and never set foot in this mine again.": 1, "Then I'll simply have to fall in love with some other senile, grousing old fool.": 1, "Then I'll take it from your corpse! Kill her!": 1, "Then I'll take it from your corpse! Kill him!": 1, "Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away.": 1, "Then I'll wait.": 1, "Then I'm going to get on the first boat to the mainland.": 1, "Then Raven Rock will no longer be attacked by those creatures.": 1, "Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death.": 1, "Then Ulfric and his men came. Those of us who didn't run were executed, except for myself, my king, and a handful of others.": 1, "Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here.": 1, "Then allow me to introduce myself.": 1, "Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be.": 1, "The, um, Emperor thanks you... Now shove off!": 1, "Then you should know that Louis and I have a certain... history.": 1, "Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this once, but you will be banished from this hall.": 1, "There is no honor in this.": 1, "There is no help for you here.": 1, "There is no fear in my heart. My father's blood flows in my veins, and he was a mighty warrior. I will face any danger.": 1, "There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.": 1, "There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking.": 1, "There is murder in the air. I can taste it.": 1, "There is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord, few enemies will be able to stand against you.": 1, "There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim.": 1, "There is much for J'zargo to be sure of.": 1, "There is more coin if you wish to claim it. You know what I want.": 1, "There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.": 1, "There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter.": 1, "There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps.": 1, "There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.": 1, "There is no news, I'm afraid.": 1, "There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered.": 1, "There is a burning city out there that needs a government.": 1, "There is a Thieves Guild in town you know.": 1, "There he is! Get him!": 1, "There he is!": 1, "There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time.": 1, "There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever.": 1, "There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues.": 1, "There have been many strangers in our lands these past few moons.": 1, "There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar.": 1, "There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from.": 1, "There has to be a clue around here somewhere.": 1, "There goes another one.": 1, "There could be no other end.": 1, "There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.": 1, "There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that lives remains the same forever.": 1, "There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny.": 1, "There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff.": 1, "There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?": 1, "There must be hundreds of years of history etched in these walls. Too bad they seem to be too damaged to read.": 1, "There must be a way. I'll find it if I have to vivisect every spriggan on this island.": 1, "There must be a way to activate these doors deeper in the ruins. Here, take this key. It should open the doors on either side of this chamber.": 1, "There might be, but I don't think you're going to like it.": 1, "There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.": 1, "There it is. Ah.... Home....": 1, "There it is!  On the table.": 1, "There it is!": 1, "There it is again. Did you hear that?": 1, "There isn't any Aetherium here, is there? Damn it!": 1, "There isn't an inch of this building that I haven't cleaned up.": 1, "There isn't a single night that passes where I don't regret what I did, but it's too late for that now.": 1, "There is truth in your words. She has not been herself since my father's death.": 1, "There is no pain in the Void!": 1, "There is the big island of Vvardenfell, and the coastal mainland.": 1, "There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.": 1, "There is skill in magic, there is charm, and there is a strong will. J'zargo will be successful, of this there is no doubt.": 1, "There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs.": 1, "There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.": 1, "There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.": 1, "There is one more thing... Since the days of the Great Hunt, our pack has kept a set of rings, blessed by Lord Hircine himself.": 1, "There is one last thing you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new night powers and blood magic.": 1, "There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.": 1, "There is nothing else to say. I am in the All-Maker's hands now.": 1, "There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices.": 1, "There is none who can stand in my way.": 1, "There is no telling what he would do to me.": 1, "There is no solace in knowing what is to come.": 1, "There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.": 1, "There is strength and courage in your eyes. You have the spirit of a great hunter.": 1, "There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.": 1, "There are too many coincidences. There must be someone behind all of my recent troubles.": 1, "There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!": 1, "There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly.": 1, "There are bound to be some there, so be careful.": 1, "There are at least thirty different ways of being attacked and killed in your own home at any given moment.": 1, "There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.": 1, "There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful.": 1, "There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust.": 1, "There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur.": 1, "There appears to be a switch of some kind here.": 1, "There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.": 1, "There a reason you're walking around with an unsheathed weapon?": 1, "Then... the leadership is not mine?": 1, "Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain.": 1, "Then... it's finally over.": 1, "Then... it was the All-Maker's will, as he said. I know I should not doubt it. But it is good to hear, all the same. Thank you.": 1, "There are dark magics at work here. Ready yourself.": 1, "Then... it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!": 1, "Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore.": 1, "Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two.": 1, "Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue.": 1, "Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right.": 1, "Then your poverty is my reward. Kill or be killed!": 1, "Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by.": 1, "Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.": 1, "Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome.": 1, "Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.": 1, "Then you're stupider than you look.": 1, "Then you're on.": 1, "Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine.": 1, "Then you'll see some real magic.": 1, "Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression.": 1, "Then, you tribe-kin.": 1, "There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned.": 1, "There are few of us left unaffected by this curse.": 1, "There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.": 1, "There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number.": 1, "There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.": 1, "There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.": 1, "There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.": 1, "There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.": 1, "There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will.": 1, "There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course.": 1, "There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine.": 1, "There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.": 1, "There are rumors of dragons on the mainland. I hope they don't show up here.": 1, "There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.": 1, "There are restless dead about... I suggest we proceed with caution.": 1, "There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.": 1, "There are plenty of other adventures I've had over the years, but you'll just have to read my next work to find out.": 1, "There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know.": 1, "There are people I've met and worked with over the years. We need their skills, their talents, if we're going to survive this.": 1, "There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret.": 1, "There are five in total, spread far apart across the Chantry.": 1, "There are indeed. Three, to be exact.": 1, "There are many valuable artifacts all through the temple.": 1, "There are more and more of those things showing up around here lately.": 1, "There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.": 1, "There are more important things than mead, Elmus.": 1, "Then you should stay. What does the world beyond our lands have to offer that we do not?": 1, "There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.": 1, "There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion.": 1, "There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.": 1, "There are no jails in an Orc Stronghold, criminal. You must pay in gold or blood.": 1, "There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.": 1, "There are no shipments scheduled today. Stop covering for him!": 1, "There are other stones around Solstheim. I fear for what has happened to them...": 1, "There are no goods to bring to the store. That's what I'm saying.": 1, "There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!": 1, "The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.": 1, "The writing describes a guardian who defeated someone named Miraak.": 1, "The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern.": 1, "The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!": 1, "The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?": 1, "The sailors I know are plenty good at finding trouble without any help from you.": 1, "The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own.": 1, "The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.": 1, "The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.": 1, "The roads just aren't safe these days.": 1, "The road to true belief is strewn with the incredulity of those that failed the journey.": 1, "The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.": 1, "The rightful Dragonborn comes soon!": 1, "The return certainly seems worth the risk though.": 1, "The restoration of this wayshrine means that Vyrthur must be dead and the Betrayed no longer have control over him.": 1, "The restless dead. Not pretty, but if you don't stop them, they'll move on to the locals.": 1, "The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim.": 1, "The rest of you lot are with me.": 1, "The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.": 1, "The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.": 1, "The rebels called it \"The Markarth Incident.\" It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started.": 1, "The reason I'm standing in front of you as only a whisper of my former self should tell you that.": 1, "The reason I was down there... and why I had the Elder Scroll.": 1, "The reason I had it... and why I was down there.": 1, "The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.": 1, "The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...": 1, "The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him.": 1, "The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail.": 1, "The quicker we find the Keepers, the quicker we can leave.": 1, "The question you should be asking is \"what don't I sell here\" because I have pretty much any supplies you might need.": 1, "The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften.": 1, "The question is, should I? I suppose if it's going to be done right, I'll have to do it.": 1, "The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as I finish up here.": 1, "The prophesied time is at last upon us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new realm of eternal darkness.": 1, "The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again.": 1, "The scroll I presume you found with Serana speaks of Auriel and his arcane weapon, Auriel's Bow.": 1, "The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed.": 1, "The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed.": 1, "The silence became almost... maddening.": 1, "The shrine of Namira is further inside. Keep going.": 1, "The shrine of Namira is beyond that door. Get ready.": 1, "The short version is that my parents and I... we were followers of Molag Bal.": 1, "The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time.": 1, "The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck.": 1, "The shadows will be your undoing!": 1, "The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance.": 1, "The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask.": 1, "The security of both Raven Rock and Councilor Morvayn is my primary concern.": 1, "The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is.": 1, "The secrets. They're in my head. Can't get them out.": 1, "The scent has gone cold.": 1, "The secrets.": 1, "The secret of the bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the prophecy, recorded in other scrolls.": 1, "The secret kind!": 1, "The secret is our mystic Redwater Spring. The magic in the waters opens the mind to experience Skooma in a way like never before.": 1, "The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava.": 1, "The second scroll declares that \"The Blood of Coldharbour's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon.\"": 1, "The second one mentions the the night sky, and the moon.": 1, "The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.": 1, "The second Word of Power. Use it to bend the wills of mortals to your purpose.": 1, "The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...": 1, "The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.": 1, "The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be.": 1, "The scrolls are merely a means to an end. The key to the Tyranny of the Sun is Serana herself.": 1, "The scroll!": 1, "The scroll you found with Serana is one of those scrolls of prophecy. Now that it is back within my grasp, we can read the scroll and learn more.": 1, "The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.": 1, "The prophecy's end approaches!": 1, "The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn.": 1, "The prophecy tells of a time in which vampires will gain power over the sun, and will no longer fear its tyranny.": 1, "The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.": 1, "The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to be embarked upon lightly.": 1, "The parchment you recovered mentions a \"Gajul-Lei.\" According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts.": 1, "The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.": 1, "The pain is so great...": 1, "The pain has subsided. Thank you for asking.": 1, "The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?": 1, "The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way.": 1, "The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child...": 1, "The others'll have to find another way out.": 1, "The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.": 1, "The others call you a friend, but I still see an outsider.": 1, "The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian.": 1, "The other chief!": 1, "The patrols never seem to give us time to be alone, the nosy pests.": 1, "The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear.": 1, "The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.": 1, "The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home.": 1, "The order of the day would be our destruction until every last vampire was hunted down and eliminated.": 1, "The only way to get to my brother is by following in the Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just as they did.": 1, "The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.": 1, "The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.": 1, "The only way I'd even consider returning to Tamriel was if Harkon were not only to fail, but to be destroyed.": 1, "The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested.": 1, "The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.": 1, "The only things that can survive here are the Ideal Masters, the undead and the souls themselves. Well, if you want to call that \"living.\"": 1, "The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago.": 1, "The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.": 1, "The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really.": 1, "The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble. ": 1, "The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.": 1, "The people are behind you.": 1, "The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.": 1, "The people of Morrowind were so grateful to have the roads safer again, they took to calling me \"Saint Jiub\" and then the other names followed.": 1, "The prophecy said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun. For someone who fancied himself as vampire royalty, that's pretty seductive.": 1, "The prophecy is no more!": 1, "The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings.": 1, "The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly.": 1, "The problem is I don't have any solid proof that anyone from House Hlaalu is hidden among us... only my suspicions.": 1, "The prisoners are in rare form, as usual.": 1, "The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters.": 1, "The prey is here!": 1, "The previous owners of the castle had a sundial in the courtyard, and obviously that didn't appeal to my mother.": 1, "The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.": 1, "The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?": 1, "The power of the Stone had been corrupted. It was the source of the influence that had taken control of the Skaal.": 1, "The power of my blood will purge that filth and make you whole again.": 1, "The power of Mzinchaleft is mine! Begone from here!": 1, "The power is growing within you, and now you must learn to wield it.": 1, "The potency of the Blood Chalice is beginning to wane. We must infuse it with more power if we are to keep it's fullest effects.": 1, "The poor thing living here probably just fell out of favor upstairs.": 1, "The people of Skyrim are more open minded about certain things than people in other places.": 1, "The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold.": 1, "The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.": 1, "The people of Skyrim owe you a great deal, whether they know it or not.": 1, "The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down.": 1, "The people still doubt me, don't they.": 1, "The skies of Keizaal are mine again!": 1, "The person who writes it.": 1, "The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it.": 1, "The place still has some of the Riekling stink on it, but that'll wash out in time. ": 1, "The pleasure's all mine.": 1, "The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.": 1, "The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope he finds something edible.": 1, "The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope she finds something edible.": 1, "The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten.": 1, "The writing in the book describes the destiny of its reader, so the words change from one person to the next.  ": 1, "The sky is all wrong. What's happening?": 1, "The snowberries are not yet sweet enough. I tasted one just this morning.": 1, "The way I figure it, it's your fault he can't pay me. So I guess I'm going to have to collect it from you.": 1, "The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city.": 1, "The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air.": 1, "The water from the spring makes the skooma so much more potent, we'll have all the thralls we'll ever need.": 1, "The warehouse is off-limits. I suggest you head back the way you came.": 1, "The warehouse is for East Empire Company workers only. Entering without permission is a crime.": 1, "The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.": 1, "The war keeps most folks away, these days.": 1, "The voices in my head are gone now thanks to you. Now I can finally get some rest.": 1, "The voice of the Ancestor Moth has always been an integral part of reading the Elder Scrolls.": 1, "The voice fades and the words begin to shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here.": 1, "The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm.": 1, "The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred. ": 1, "The village is just ahead. Storn has used his magic to raise a barrier around it, protecting the few of us left.": 1, "The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war.": 1, "The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.": 1, "The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!": 1, "The very fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has merely increased his desire to have it.": 1, "The very elements are at my command!": 1, "The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.": 1, "The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing.": 1, "The vapors are waning, but not yet gone. Take a breath. Peryite will speak if He sees fit.": 1, "The vampires will show us no mercy. They've proven that.": 1, "The vampires are much more dangerous than we ever dreamed. The Dawnguard is the only hope now.": 1, "The vampire is eternal, and with immortality comes the revelation that these bonds never endure... it's fleeting, momentary at best.": 1, "The usual. Piles of armor to repair for the Redoran Guard.": 1, "The unworthy flee before the Master's power.": 1, "The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful.": 1, "The tyranny of the sun is over!": 1, "The two of them just never got along. That's why Isran didn't have you go looking for him when he sent you after us.": 1, "The very thought breaks my heart.": 1, "The twisted forms you've seen didn't occur overnight. It isn't a plague or a disease that ravaged our species.": 1, "The way I've heard it, the sun represents the connection from our world to theirs.": 1, "The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold.": 1, "The wounds are deep, Vilod! I can't stop the blood.": 1, "The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.": 1, "The worship of Talos outlawed, and now the Thalmor come to conduct their witch-hunts while the Empire stands idly by.": 1, "The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?": 1, "The world is alive, and so am I, for once.": 1, "The words.": 1, "The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.": 1, "The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness...": 1, "The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably shouldn't know about.": 1, "The wizards called it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.": 1, "The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.": 1, "The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.": 1, "The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed.": 1, "The wise man knows when to retreat!": 1, "The way is dangerous, and the gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!": 1, "The wind plays a trick on my ears, surely.": 1, "The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.": 1, "The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!": 1, "The what?": 1, "The what of what? No. No idea.": 1, "The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.": 1, "The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow. ": 1, "The weapons of the Skaal will never be dull as long as Baldor Iron-Shaper tends the forge.": 1, "The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them.": 1, "The way you walk around at home is your own business.

Run, damn it!": 1, "The whole village is here! What sorcery is this?": 1, "The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!": 1, "The truth will take you!": 1, "The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now.": 1, "The sun cannot protect you any more!": 1, "The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.": 1, "The suffering the Daedra cause will not go unpunished.": 1, "The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor.": 1, "The strongholds keep to themselves.

We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat.": 1, "The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart.": 1, "The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.": 1, "The steam! Quick, shut it off!": 1, "The sunbursts would certainly hurt anything, but is especially devastating to the undead.": 1, "The stairs are knocked out. I have no doubt you can find a way up. You never know, you may find something of value up there.": 1, "The spiders put you through the ringer?": 1, "The spell that is. I think I can fix the spell. It should only take a couple more years.": 1, "The source of the poison must be destroyed once and for all, otherwise another dealer will simply take his place.": 1, "The soul of a dragon is as resilient as its owner's scaly hide.": 1, "The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.": 1, "The sooner you remember that, the better.": 1, "The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal.": 1, "The sooner we get the scroll home, the sooner we deal with my father.": 1, "The sooner we get out of this place, the better.": 1, "The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night.": 1, "The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives.": 1, "The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.": 1, "The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.": 1, "The soil beneath our feet is steeped in the blood of our ancestors.

Are you now prepared?": 1, "The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.": 1, "The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game.

There's thanks for you.": 1, "They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place.

I'll go with you.": 1, "They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.": 1, "They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.": 1, "They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.": 1, "They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.": 1, "They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you.": 1, "They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical.": 1, "They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps.": 1, "They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand.": 1, "They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back.": 1, "They keep the doors locked when they come down.

You're welcome to wait here if you like.": 1, "They should be among our kind, not laying about unguarded for mortals to find.": 1, "They serve the best sujamma I've ever tasted over at the Retching Netch. Worth every coin.": 1, "They sent it back to me recently, but it never arrived.": 1, "They seem to when you're around Silana.": 1, "They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating.": 1, "They seem to have believed this one to be particularly valuable, as it is secured in a mechanism which I have been unable to open. Yet.": 1, "They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.": 1, "They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...": 1, "They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi.": 1, "They say this marriage is the first step towards peace. Who in Shor's name wants peace?

Brother Verulus has the whole place closed.": 1, "They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.": 1, "They say if a vampire so much as scratches you, you'll turn into one. That better not be true.": 1, "They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.": 1, "They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!": 1, "They say anyone who steps foot on that island will meet an early death... hope you know what you're doing.": 1, "They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad.": 1, "They said it couldn't be done. They said it. They said it. But they were wrong!": 1, "They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. ": 1, "They request Auriel's Bow, and I request their assistance. It's been repeated so many times, I can't imagine it any other way.": 1, "They represented the steps the Initiates took on the path to total enlightenment.": 1, "They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin.": 1, "They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em.": 1, "They promise people they'll kill off all the Nords that rule over the Reach. Nothing but murderers and saboteurs.": 1, "They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...": 1, "They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.": 1, "They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city.": 1, "They have a ship. They took me there and showed me the map. You will find it on the northern coast of the island.": 1, "They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me...": 1, "They bring us things from their homeland that we can't find on the island, such as spices, fine cloth and ores that we cannot mine here.": 1, "They belong among our kind, not gathering mold in some vagabond's treasure pile.": 1, "They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor.": 1, "They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor.": 1, "They attacked us. Those bastards at Frossel. Stole our treasure - wait! Forget I said that. That's my treasure. You can't have it!": 1, "They arrived here ten years ago, and have been nothing but a benefit to Raven Rock ever since.": 1, "They aren't very clever, are they?": 1, "They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?": 1, "They aren't my \"people.\" I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!": 1, "They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine.": 1, "They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.": 1, "They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too.": 1, "They are where we inter our dead. They are sacred places, meant to honor their passing.": 1, "They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.": 1, "They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos. ": 1, "They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown Princess.": 1, "They are perfect. Thank you both.": 1, "They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day.": 1, "They are off working on their pillar. Happens every night.": 1, "They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!": 1, "They are good, loyal children.": 1, "They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.": 1, "They are fierce warriors of the Forsworn tribes.": 1, "They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass.": 1, "They are determined and well-armed, but foolish if they think they can defy us. We will deal with them in time.": 1, "They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility.": 1, "They are but one more hardship added to the many we already endure.": 1, "They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.": 1, "They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.": 1, "They are profane creatures with no hope of redemption. They lure innocents to their deaths and corrupt the souls of all they touch.": 1, "They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die.": 1, "They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?": 1, "They call themselves the \"Blood Horkers.\" ": 1, "They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. ": 1, "They had welcomed the Empire with open arms, and benefited from it.": 1, "They had control of my mind, but fortunately they couldn't possess my soul.": 1, "They got used to Idgrod just fine, didn't they? So what's the difference?": 1, "They gave them to their workers as an incentive at one point... a kind of reward for extra effort.": 1, "They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy.": 1, "They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.": 1, "They embody a council made up of five Great Houses: Telvanni, Dres, Indoril, Sadras and Redoran.": 1, "They drink all day and night and what do I do?": 1, "They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?": 1, "They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir.": 1, "They don't make finer steel anywhere else. If this doesn't keep you from dying, nothing will.": 1, "They don't like us talking to people when we work.": 1, "They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.": 1, "They don't exactly grow on trees, you know.": 1, "They die too quickly. Maybe I'll try and hold off on the paralysis next time. Give me more of a moving target. Good practice.": 1, "They didn't think Skyrim has a vampire problem, and I did.": 1, "They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit.": 1, "They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.": 1, "They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.": 1, "They can't talk the wave signs!": 1, "They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help.": 1, "They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim.": 1, "They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.": 1, "They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers.": 1, "They could be underground, flying above us... They might be the ground. I have no idea.": 1, "They demand the Moot.": 1, "They did it to gain our confidence, councilor. They had us all fooled.": 1, "They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else.": 1, "They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head.": 1, "They didn't stop to visit, though. They rode through town heading south, and went across the big bridge.": 1, "They could be anywhere on the island. The mines might be a good place to start.": 1, "They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.": 1, "They shouldn't be that hard to find. Shelves, tables... should be easy to find. She wouldn't have hidden them.": 1, "They slaughtered everyone and stormed the Inner Sanctum where I believe they corrupted Vyrthur.": 1, "They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.": 1, "They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.": 1, "They're stuck in there.": 1, "They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.": 1, "They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years.": 1, "They're shut down, but they still respond to the control cubes.": 1, "They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.": 1, "They're saying that the dragons have returned. As if we didn't have enough to worry about already.": 1, "They're sayin' dragons have returned to Skyrim. Now that there, that's a real problem.": 1, "They're respectable fighters, and I think they see the benefits of having a vampire on their side, now.": 1, "They're remnants of the old rulers of Markarth. Natives of the Reach. Followers of the old ways.": 1, "They're quite wealthy and they've been quite generous by sharing their fortune with the community.": 1, "They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.": 1, "They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!": 1, "They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.": 1, "They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.": 1, "They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway.": 1, "They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough. ": 1, "They're none of her business, and none of yours either.": 1, "They're no longer being made, so they've become collectible. I'd love to get my hands on a few of them.": 1, "They're mystic entities that lord over the Soul Cairn, controlling every aspect from its fabric to its appearance.": 1, "They're my puppets. I have their \"king\" rotting in Cidhna Mine.": 1, "They're miners. Harmless.": 1, "They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power.": 1, "They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.": 1, "They're lording it over us all the time, though.": 1, "They're incredible. I don't know how we ever got them to take in this soil, but I'm glad they did.": 1, "They're in my head!": 1, "They're hurt, but they'll live.": 1, "They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.": 1, "They're only a threat in the hills and along the roads, where they live. Everywhere else, we are in control.": 1, "They're half-naked. That ain't right. Somebody's gotta say somethin'...": 1, "They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.": 1, "They're the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. ": 1, "Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.": 1, "Things just go from bad to worse. First the war, now dragons... what's this world coming to?": 1, "Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...": 1, "Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.": 1, "Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it.": 1, "Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.": 1, "Things are picking up... for now.": 1, "Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place.": 1, "Things are looking up around here, lass.": 1, "Things are looking up around here, lad.": 1, "Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.": 1, "Things are bad, Igmund. Our forces are barely able to keep the Forsworn in check. Merchants are reporting the loss of more of their shipments.": 1, "Thief! I'll teach you.": 1, "Thief! ": 1, "They're the largest trading company in Tamriel, originally chartered by the Emperor of Cyrodiil himself.": 1, "They... they're dead. My mama died when I was little. I... I don't remember her very well.": 1, "They've only gotten louder since I've stayed. Pounding, driving. A couple of times I blacked out. It was...": 1, "They've laughed at me, Aphia. They thought I was a crazy old fool. But I proved them wrong.": 1, "They've grown, all right - lazier and more stupid.": 1, "They've contributed coin, food, supplies... even helped repair a few of the buildings in town with their own hands.": 1, "They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.": 1, "They've been around as long as I can remember, but only recently focused on our ships.": 1, "They're... dead.": 1, "They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year.": 1, "They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.": 1, "They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.": 1, "They're trolls. They smell like trolls. I can't help that either.": 1, "They're too smart to have left it in the Bulwark. I'd search one of the abandoned houses on the outskirts of town.": 1, "They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.": 1, "They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.": 1, "They... they just kept coming.": 1, "They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though.": 1, "They're ghosts of the snow elf priests that tended the wayshrines before being slaughtered by the Betrayed.": 1, "They're fearsome!": 1, "They were both drunk with power, and pulling in different directions.": 1, "They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.": 1, "They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.": 1, "They were aberrations, false prophets. They used their status as heroes to shield the True Tribunal from our minds.": 1, "They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.": 1, "They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive.": 1, "They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs.": 1, "They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something.": 1, "They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.": 1, "They usually make runs along the coast shipping all sorts of contraband to and from Morrowind.": 1, "They usually didn't amount to much, but they make my job that much harder.": 1, "They used to criss-cross the skies over Morrowind like vermin. Nasty flying creatures with a habit of sneaking up on the unwary.": 1, "They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers.": 1, "They used to call Windhelm, \"the City of Kings.\" In my books, anyway.": 1, "They were eventually forced to put him down. The Jarl banished them from the hold, but they stuck to their cause.": 1, "They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.": 1, "They tried me for murder, threw me on a prison ship and sent me to the jail in Vivec City.": 1, "They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.": 1, "They threw me out, Tolan!": 1, "They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.": 1, "They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.": 1, "They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.": 1, "They swept into the Chantry without warning and began killing everyone without pause.": 1, "They still pay me for supplies and passage and I can always use the coin.": 1, "They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us.": 1, "They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.": 1, "They started attacking the Bulwark a few weeks ago. My men were able to kill them, but they keep coming back.": 1, "They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time. ": 1, "They sprung from the ground with no warning and killed one of my companions instantly. I was so frightened, I ran all the way back to Raven Rock.": 1, "They speak also of something worse than dragons buried within. Difficult to imagine, but if true...": 1, "They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine.": 1, "They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be.": 1, "They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave.": 1, "They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.": 1, "They're crazy. Think they rule the Reach.": 1, "They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame.": 1, "They're befouling the memories of our forefathers by defiling their remains.": 1, "They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.": 1, "They're back to regular size. It didn't hurt nearly as much this time.": 1, "They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map....": 1, "They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about \"keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.\"": 1, "They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.": 1, "They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.": 1, "They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they can. ": 1, "They'll never understand. No amount of flowers or honeyed words are going to change my mind.": 1, "They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.": 1, "They'll never see you coming.": 1, "They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search.": 1, "They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can.": 1, "They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.": 1, "They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time.": 1, "They were never even able to go down there and recover the body... the East Empire Company sealed that section off to prevent any more tragedies.": 1, "They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger.": 1, "They were smaller back then.": 1, "They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors.": 1, "They what?": 1, "They will allow you to draw the waters from the shrine's basin as if you've been enlightened.": 1, "They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?": 1, "They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.": 1, "They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. ": 1, "They won't respond to you in any way other than believing that you're an Initiate and you're undertaking the journey to the Inner Sanctum.": 1, "They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here.": 1, "They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people.": 1, "They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for your own people! All of Skyrim would have seen the truth then.": 1, "They'd be even less welcoming to her than they've been to me. It would have been a bloodbath.": 1, "They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere.": 1, "There she is!": 1, "They also have glowing stones of some kind at the top. They look vaguely similar to drawings I've seen of objects called Impact Stones.": 1, "They actually remove their own hearts, and replace them with large briar seeds. It puts their lifesparks in direct connection to the natural forces.": 1, "There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure.": 1, "There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.": 1, "There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.": 1, "There's another door. See if you can get it open.": 1, "There's an unused inlet on the northern side of the island that was used by the previous owners to bring supplies into the castle.": 1, "There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.": 1, "There's an offering altar not terribly far from here. I'm willing to bet that the gem you're looking for is there.": 1, "There's an intruder in the fort! Repel him immediately!": 1, "There's an inn at Kynesgrove - the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course.": 1, "There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory.": 1, "There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.": 1, "There's an Ulen Ancestral Tomb near the Temple. Someone's been leaving ash yam offerings on the altar inside.": 1, "There's an Altmer who's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Nelacar. You should speak with him, if you're so curious.": 1, "There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.": 1, "There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.": 1, "There's always the Thieves Guild.": 1, "There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.": 1, "There's a... A problem, yes.": 1, "There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.": 1, "There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?": 1, "There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.": 1, "There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so.": 1, "There's a terrible ache in my back today.": 1, "There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths.": 1, "There's a smart lass. Check the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.": 1, "There's a smart lad. Take the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.": 1, "There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.": 1, "There's a shrine there, but I'm not sure what it means...": 1, "There's a shrine at the Earth Stone. It's... I'm not really sure what it's for. I thought I knew at one point.": 1, "There's a shrine at the Earth Stone, but... well, I can't seem to recall what it's for.": 1, "There's actually a funny story behind the name, friend.": 1, "There's a shrine at the Earth Stone, I think.": 1, "There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.": 1, "There's been something strange happening on Solstheim for a while, but this... this is something else. I hope you get to the bottom of it.": 1, "There's no need for that kind of talk. I said it was possible.": 1, "There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war.": 1, "There's no mistake. You've committed crimes against the Dunmer people of Solstheim, and in the name of House Redoran it's time to face justice.": 1, "There's no mistake. You're a wanted woman... and it's time to pay for your crimes.": 1, "There's no mistake. You're a wanted man... and it's time to pay for your crimes.": 1, "There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for dust cleaners.": 1, "There's no hiding from me...": 1, "There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour.": 1, "There's no gold, nothing shiny at all.": 1, "There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.": 1, "There's no excuse for your behavior!": 1, "There's no escape!": 1, "There's no escape from this place.": 1, "There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.": 1, "There's been something strange going on there for a while, but after this... I'm done. I'm not going back to Solstheim.": 1, "There's no blood here for you.": 1, "There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.": 1, "There's more, yet. Don't get too comfortable.": 1, "There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it.": 1, "There's just so much to memorize. How am I supposed to remember what goes where for every single herb?": 1, "There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.": 1, "There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.": 1, "There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.": 1, "There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.": 1, "There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.": 1, "There's got to be more to life than sweeping and cleaning all day.": 1, "There's every chance I'll return to find a pile of smoking ash where Whiterun once stood.": 1, "There's enough for us to fight out there. I don't need us having to defend ourselves within our own fort.": 1, "There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked away in the hills. ": 1, "There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand.": 1, "There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend.": 1, "There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right.": 1, "There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.": 1, "There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold.": 1, "There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?": 1, "There you are. Looks like this place has been cleaned out. At least the shard is still here...": 1, "There you are. Look, I... I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?": 1, "There you are. I've been trying to find you.": 1, "There you are. I'm... I'm back.": 1, "There you are. Give me a hand with this door, would you?": 1, "There you are, weakling!": 1, "There you are, father!": 1, "There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' \"Choose your victim\" gag with you. Ah, I love that one...": 1, "There will be time to honor the fallen later. For now, we've got to put a stop to these vampires.": 1, "There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind.": 1, "There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever.": 1, "There were ten of them in all. Find them for me, please, I beg you!": 1, "There were splinter groups that resisted the agreement, and even some that sought alternate alliances.": 1, "There you go!": 1, "There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world.": 1, "There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die.": 1, "There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days.": 1, "There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.": 1, "There was some bother about a group of mages being exiled. I can't remember what the details were.": 1, "There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.": 1, "There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity.": 1, "There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.": 1, "There was a time when this town meant something. Now it's all gone.": 1, "There was a time when I called Tamriel my home, but those days have long since passed.": 1, "There was a horrible accident, and he was killed when one of the tunnels collapsed.": 1, "There was a great brown bear on the slopes the other day. I could swear by the All-Maker that it was watching the village.": 1, "There was a great battle here in Whiterun. It was quite thrilling! I must compose a song about it someday.": 1, "There something I can do for you? Perhaps direct you to the nearest prison...": 1, "There should be a way to turn this off.": 1, "There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.": 1, "There you go! Now let's see what mysteries await us in the next room.": 1, "There you go, son. Be your own man!": 1, "There you go. I didn't doubt you for a second. Let's see what's up ahead.": 1, "There's a place for trash, and that's not it.": 1, "There's a passage up there. We could reach it if the water level was higher.": 1, "There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.": 1, "There's a new museum opening up in Dawnstar. The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers.": 1, "There's a new lady in charge of the Orphanage in Riften. She asked me to hand out these notices to everyone I met.": 1, "There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?": 1, "There's a lot of work to do, still, getting this place back up and running.": 1, "There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.": 1, "There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.": 1, "There's a lever, right there in the center. Hurry, before more of them show up!": 1, "There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land.": 1, "There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.": 1, "There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there.": 1, "There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.": 1, "There's a difference?": 1, "There's a courtyard in the castle. I used to help her tend a garden there.": 1, "There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?": 1, "There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns.": 1, "There you go. You may as well take Gunjar's gear. He won't be needing it any more.": 1, "There! All better.": 1, "There! Now attack it!": 1, "There! Now, I...": 1, "There'd better be. I didn't come all this way to leave empty handed.": 1, "There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.": 1, "There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter.": 1, "There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.": 1, "There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.": 1, "There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt.": 1, "There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn.": 1, "There's a cave. Tread carefully.": 1, "There's a chill in the air. Ysmir's beard, it gets colder in here every day.": 1, "There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets.": 1, "They add a different kind of sweetness. Tart. Makes the flavor more round.": 1, "There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else.": 1, "There's no one around to disturb me and distract me from my writing. Present company excepted of course.": 1, "These days, we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like.": 1, "These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!": 1, "These days I focus a little more on the creature comforts of the hall, though. The food, the drink, the stories.": 1, "These damn bears are driving me crazy!": 1, "These chosen few can divine events of the past and future within the scrolls, though in time, it drives us to blindness.": 1, "These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...": 1, "These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know.": 1, "These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able.": 1, "These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.": 1, "These are the molten rocks that lay next to the Heart of Lorkhan for millennia. Some vestige of its power must have seeped into them.": 1, "These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.": 1, "These are dark times. How will we get through them without Storn to guide us?": 1, "These Vigilants never know when to give up. I thought we'd taught them enough of a lesson at their hall.": 1, "These Vigilants are nothing but talk.": 1, "These days? Aye. Most of what I make is for folk like you.": 1, "These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength.": 1, "These Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.": 1, "These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.": 1, "These Reach folk are so... nosy.": 1, "These Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.": 1, "These Falmer are... they're frozen in the ice.": 1, "Therefore, when an arrow is loosed from the bow, it produces a magical effect very similar to being burned by fire.": 1, "Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations.": 1, "Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.": 1, "There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak.": 1, "There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor.": 1, "There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination.": 1, "There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.": 1, "There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.": 1, "There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.": 1, "These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.": 1, "There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.": 1, "These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean.": 1, "These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn obviously was growing more desparate once he left the College.": 1, "They abandoned us long ago, so your contacts are meaningless here. That's it.": 1, "These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.": 1, "These wall carvings are ancient, we must be getting close.": 1, "These vampires claimed they had some purpose in store for me, but they wouldn't say what. Probably hoping to ransom me, the fools.": 1, "These vampires are becoming a real menace.": 1, "These two aren't a problem anymore.": 1, "These tools were found in a crypt outside Windhelm. They belonged to the ancient Nords who dwelt in Skyrim before the days of the First Empire.": 1, "These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.": 1, "These things are everywhere, aren't they?": 1, "These statues are clearly the focus of this area. There must be some way to interact with them.": 1, "These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I.": 1, "These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.": 1, "These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence.": 1, "These runes have faded a bit, but I believe I can translate the inscription.": 1, "These fights are invite only. And you're not invited. Slag off.": 1, "These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated.": 1, "These pillars must have something to do with it.": 1, "These people were... why would anyone want to set up camp here?": 1, "These people seem nervous, which makes me nervous.": 1, "These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.": 1, "These pages meant the world to me. Thank you!": 1, "These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone.": 1, "These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say.": 1, "These must be the \"Great Workshops of Nchardak\". Impressive even in ruins.": 1, "These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.": 1, "These look like good quality, too. I know it's not the glamorous, heroic work, but don't be surprised if I ask you to do it again.": 1, "These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.": 1, "These hands were made for bending steel... not mending bonemold. But, it's certainly better than not working at all.": 1, "These fruits and vegetables are disappointing, Carlotta.": 1, "These four boilers provide steam to the room upstairs.": 1, "These platforms are definitely moving more quickly. Can you keep up with them?": 1, "There's times I think you're the coldest man in Skyrim. This is your own flesh and blood you're talking about.": 1, "There's the woman herself!": 1, "There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless.": 1, "There's nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about at all...": 1, "There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.": 1, "There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime.": 1, "There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.": 1, "There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!": 1, "There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?": 1, "There's nothing finer than dark elf sujamma... like nectar it is.": 1, "There's nothing else to discuss. Use the North Gate if you want to enter Riften.": 1, "There's nothing beyond the Bulwark except wild Nords and ash wastes.": 1, "There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls.": 1, "There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean.": 1, "There's not a whole lot to tell. ": 1, "There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.": 1, "There's no way out. There's no way out....": 1, "There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.": 1, "There's no way out that way, you know...": 1, "There's no use hiding from me.": 1, "There's no time. We've got to get you out of here! Come on, let's go!": 1, "There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!": 1, "There's no time to waste. Let's go.": 1, "There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again.": 1, "There's no time for that now, I have work to do.": 1, "There's no telling what we might find inside!": 1, "There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink.": 1, "There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man without a conscience. ": 1, "There's no resting your hide in a cell in this prison. Here, you work. You'll mine ore until you start throwing up silver bars.": 1, "There's no refusing a summons from the Greybeards. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your power.": 1, "There's no reasoning with these people anymore.": 1, "There's no reason to bourdon you with my troubles.": 1, "There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.": 1, "There's no way he could still be alive.": 1, "There's nowhere to run. And I'm certainly not moving in with my mother, if that's what your implying.": 1, "There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.": 1, "There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.": 1, "There's the one about Tiber Septim and the dragon Nafaalilargus. I never bothered to learn it.": 1, "There's the man himself!": 1, "There's that group of bandits that need to be taught a lesson, remember?": 1, "There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe.": 1, "There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him.": 1, "There's still the matter of Paarthurnax. I'm not ungrateful for what you've done. Esbern speaks for both of us.": 1, "There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.": 1, "There's still Imperial camps to be cleaned up, as you know. And that takes arms and armor.": 1, "There's something... wrong here.": 1, "There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.": 1, "There's something you need?": 1, "There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must.": 1, "There's something out there.": 1, "There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?": 1, "There's some company I certainly prefer over others. Have you met Mikael? The most amazing bard I've ever heard.": 1, "There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.": 1, "There's so much to do. I'm going to head out and start tracking things down. We'll meet again, I'm sure of it.": 1, "There's one way to find out. Try to Shout...": 1, "There's one way to find out. Try to Shout... that would prove it.": 1, "There's only one chief!": 1, "There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.": 1, "There's only one thing left to do. We have to prove this actually works. That this is the real Aetherium Forge.": 1, "There's only one thing worth remembering.": 1, "There's no need to hide. I won't hurt you.": 1, "There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.": 1, "There's plenty for all.": 1, "There's plenty of gold out there for the taking... if you're up to the challenge.": 1, "There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting.": 1, "There's probably an exit through one of these sarcophagi. Let's get moving.": 1, "There's probably groves like this all over Tamriel. Most people just don't even know what to look for.": 1, "There's really nothing remarkable in the letters. I don't know what he's so excited about.": 1, "There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.": 1, "The only thing I see around here in abundance are soul husks. You know, those ugly fungus-looking things growing out of the ground.": 1, "The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire.": 1, "The only thing I need to do, dear wife, is make sure profits are up, no matter what. If Thongvor won't do the dirty work, I will.": 1, "The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.": 1, "The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.": 1, "The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.": 1, "The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.": 1, "The College has developed some theories, however.": 1, "The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.": 1, "The Chantry was constructed near the beginning of the First Era to provide a retreat for those that wished to become enlightened.": 1, "The Chantry was a place of peaceful worship. I led a small group of paladins, but we were no match for the Betrayed's sheer numbers.": 1, "The Chantry is quite isolated, so it took some time for word of the dwarves' offer to reach us here.": 1, "The Chalice? Why?": 1, "The Chalice has been in Lord Harkon's possession for quite some time now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our powers.": 1, "The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's \"to keep it safe\" but I know he's just keeping it for himself.": 1, "The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.": 1, "The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.": 1, "The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general.": 1, "The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists.": 1, "The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog.": 1, "The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.": 1, "The Blades killed them all centuries ago. Nobody asks to hear that lay anymore.": 1, "The Blades have never followed that path, of course.": 1, "The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors.": 1, "The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.": 1, "The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not trust another dovah.": 1, "The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...": 1, "The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman.": 1, "The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular.": 1, "The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.": 1, "The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.": 1, "The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.": 1, "The Black-Briars have Riften in their pocket and the Thieves Guild watchin' their back, so keep your nose out of their business.": 1, "The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.": 1, "The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.": 1, "The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated.": 1, "The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim.": 1, "The Dawnguard apparently like killing vampires.": 1, "The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course. ": 1, "The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls.": 1, "The Dark Elves sometimes visit our village, though it's been awhile since I've seen one.": 1, "The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way. ": 1, "The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!": 1, "The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?": 1, "The Dark Brotherhood?": 1, "The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it.": 1, "The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I... my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?": 1, "The Daedra has us. It's you or me!": 1, "The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors.": 1, "The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.": 1, "The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear.": 1, "The College is not the only place to learn about magic.": 1, "The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight.": 1, "The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr.": 1, "The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.": 1, "The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to. ": 1, "The Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran.": 1, "The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge?": 1, "The College will not fall!": 1, "The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste.": 1, "The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own.": 1, "The College survived, and so here we remain.": 1, "The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town.": 1, "The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.": 1, "The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.": 1, "The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.": 1, "The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.": 1, "The Companions can help protect the city, and the Emperor will be in our debt.": 1, "The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures.": 1, "The Black Book. It shoved them in there. With black slick fingers.": 1, "The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.": 1, "That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth.": 1, "That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste.": 1, "That's...that's...wow.": 1, "That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though...": 1, "That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.": 1, "That's... complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you. ": 1, "That's... all you've got?": 1, "That's... a long story.": 1, "That's, what, your third? All right, only one left to go. I'll meet you there.": 1, "That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.": 1, "That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.": 1, "That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.": 1, "That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke.": 1, "That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.": 1, "That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world.": 1, "That's why our leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. Real, serious vampire hunters.": 1, "That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.": 1, "That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.": 1, "That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.": 1, "That's why I always try to be ready for anything.": 1, "That's where you come in. I've got plenty of work available that could guide us down the road to recovery.": 1, "That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.": 1, "That's what you said yesterday!": 1, "That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard.": 1, "That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!": 1, "That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?": 1, "That's what you always say.": 1, "That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.": 1, "That's what they say.": 1, "That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.": 1, "That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate.": 1, "That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it? ": 1, "That... has to be the place. I've never seen a building like that before.": 1, "That... that wasn't me you were fighting.": 1, "The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.": 1, "The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago.": 1, "The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it.": 1, "The Augur?": 1, "The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.": 1, "The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary.": 1, "The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.": 1, "The Arch-Mage.": 1, "The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!": 1, "The Arch-Mage is dead! Dead!": 1, "The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.": 1, "The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that.": 1, "The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.": 1, "The All-Maker sees you, even if I cannot.": 1, "The All-Maker made you Dragonborn for a higher purpose. Do not forget that.": 1, "The All-Maker is the maker of all things, and it is from the All-Maker that life flows like a great river.": 1, "The All-Maker frowns upon such violence.": 1, "That... wasn't as unpleasant as I thought it would be.": 1, "That... well, that might change things.": 1, "That... wizard is still at the Inn. I can't believe Dagur allows him to stay there.": 1, "That? It's... Well, it's a shrine for... something. I'm not sure what.": 1, "The \"Eye of Magnus\"?": 1, "The \"Great War\"... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?  ": 1, "The Dawnguard have increased their operations and have been aggressively recruiting.": 1, "The \"problem\" is your disrespect for the laws of this land. It's time to face the Jarl's justice.": 1, "The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.": 1, "The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn.": 1, "The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.": 1, "The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!": 1, "The All-Maker favors those who work hard to hone their skills, as you have done.": 1, "The All-Maker frowns upon such needless violence.": 1, "The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.": 1, "That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.": 1, "The Dawnguard will now be dedicated to safeguarding it, making sure that prophecy will never come to pass.": 1, "The Dawnguard will, no doubt, soon become even more of a nuisance now that Auriel's Bow has been recovered.": 1, "The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.": 1, "The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.": 1, "The Greybeards are a strange bunch.": 1, "The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.": 1, "The Great War... only thirty years past and already ancient history to most people.": 1, "The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.": 1, "The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known.": 1, "The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it.": 1, "The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad.": 1, "The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.": 1, "The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.": 1, "The Gourmet. This is such an honor.": 1, "The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.": 1, "The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef.": 1, "The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.": 1, "The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore.": 1, "The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments.": 1, "The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.": 1, "The Forsworn? That's right. I'll say it. We all knew. Even that fat-headed, slave-driving Mulush knew. Just ask him about it.": 1, "The Forsworn? Strange. Well, I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future, for what it's worth.": 1, "The Forsworn live in the hills on the western edge of Skyrim.": 1, "The Forsworn know every stone in the Reach. We have to wait them out.": 1, "The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.": 1, "The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin.": 1, "The Forsworn aren't our real concern, defeating the Imperials and making sure we keep control of this city is.": 1, "The Forsworn are little more than beasts. They won't listen to reason, so prepare for the worst.": 1, "The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?": 1, "The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.": 1, "The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.": 1, "The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill.": 1, "The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now.": 1, "The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.": 1, "The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.": 1, "The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning.": 1, "The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.": 1, "The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots.": 1, "The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since.": 1, "The Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. I can't be a part of that.": 1, "The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.": 1, "The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.": 1, "The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it.": 1, "The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least.": 1, "The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth! ": 1, "The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.": 1, "The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills. ": 1, "The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.": 1, "The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim.": 1, "The Imperial agent? That's right. I knew. How many dogs is the Empire going to send after me?": 1, "The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine.": 1, "The Imperial City's so far from here, it might as well be on one of the moons. And yet the Empire thinks it can tell us what to do an' how to live.": 1, "The Ideal Masters unleashed their Keepers and sent them to destroy me.": 1, "The Ideal Masters have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly investigate the fact that the barrier has fallen.": 1, "The Ideal Masters have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly intervene if you're perceived as a threat.": 1, "The Ideal Masters assured me that my powers would be unmatched, that I could raise legions of the undead.": 1, "The Hall was a place of respite, learning and comradeship, where a road-weary brother or sister could rest for a time in peace and comfort.": 1, "The Hall of the Vigilants is in ruins, my brothers and sisters dead or scattered.": 1, "The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...": 1, "The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.": 1, "The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there.": 1, "The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.": 1, "The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled.": 1, "The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.": 1, "The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.": 1, "The Greybeards...": 1, "The Ideal Masters's weakness is their insatiable hunger for pure souls.": 1, "The Eye of Magnus?": 1, "The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned.": 1, "The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world.": 1, "The Elder Scroll is just a bit further.": 1, "The Elder Council...": 1, "The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.": 1, "The East Empire Pendants are scattered all over, so leave no stone unturned.": 1, "The East Empire Company must have felt it was of great value, as they locked that section of the mine off from everyone else.": 1, "The East Empire Company is in your debt.": 1, "The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics.": 1, "The Earth Stone, and... It's a shrine that... Hmm. I can't recall.": 1, "The Earth Stone is there. There's also a shrine...": 1, "The Earth Stone is there, and the rest... It's a shrine, but I... Did we build that? I'm not sure.": 1, "The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last visit.": 1, "The Dwemer certainly knew how to build for the ages. These towers have outlasted their creators by millenia.": 1, "The Dunmer race doesn't bury their dead, or leave them to rot inside a stone sarcophagus.": 1, "The Dunmer have been growing food in the ashlands for thousands of years.": 1, "The Elder Scroll is just ahead.": 1, "The Dunmer don't believe that death is the end, we believe that it's the beginning.": 1, "The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn.": 1, "The Dread Lord awaits!": 1, "The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.": 1, "The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?": 1, "The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to.": 1, "The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.": 1, "The Dovahkiin has freed me! Now you will pay for my years of slavery!": 1, "The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god.": 1, "The Dominion is here, and we're watching you.": 1, "The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.": 1, "The Divines smile on a charitable soul.": 1, "The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well.": 1, "The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?": 1, "The Dawnstar Sanctuary? That where you lot are holing up in now? Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you - a lot - but I can help you out.": 1, "The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.": 1, "The Elder Scrolls told of their return.": 1, "The Elder Scrolls vanished from the Imperial City around 175 of this era and have been scattered across Tamriel by forces unknown.": 1, "The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling. ": 1, "The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age.": 1, "The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed. ": 1, "The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?": 1, "The Empire would have us become their slaves as they have become slaves to the Thalmor. I will not live as a slave, nor will I die as one.": 1, "The Empire will send someone to find me. You'll see!": 1, "The Empire will return. Count on it.": 1, "The Empire pulled most of its forces out of Morrowind to deal with the gates in their own homeland, leaving us virtually defenseless.": 1, "The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both.": 1, "The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough.": 1, "The Empire may try to reclaim Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves.": 1, "The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past.": 1, "The Empire is weak. That is why we fight them. Skyrim must be ruled by the strong.": 1, "The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little.": 1, "The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.": 1, "The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?": 1, "The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything.": 1, "The Empire has no place in Skyrim... not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.": 1, "The Emissary? What's this about?": 1, "The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.": 1, "The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources... so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.": 1, "The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?": 1, "The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry!": 1, "The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!": 1, "The Dawnguard will want the Bow, and they will fight us, hard, to get it.": 1, "The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.": 1, "The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!": 1, "The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace.": 1, "The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.": 1, "The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.": 1, "The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship.": 1, "The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern.": 1, "The Empire I remember never surrendered.": 1, "The Jarl can be found in the Great Hall, probably sitting on his Jarl's throne. Not over here in a wizard's laboratory.": 1, "That's what he's after. He wants to control the sun, have vampires control the world. ": 1, "That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.": 1, "That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.": 1, "That's actually only a fraction of its potential.": 1, "That's about the truth of it. Write tales about the sights I've seen. The battles I've fought.": 1, "That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.": 1, "That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?": 1, "That's a true Reachman. Hope he heads to Markarth to take out some of those Nords.": 1, "That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.": 1, "That's a tempting offer... when you actually have the gold, I might be willing to consider it.": 1, "That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?": 1, "That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.": 1, "That's a shame. I'll make sure to let their families know. In the meantime, finish off those draugr so it'll be safe when I bring in a fresh crew.": 1, "That's a sensible lad. Now fetch me drink.": 1, "That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.": 1, "That's a real shame. Gonna make it hard for you to pay a healer after we cave your skull in.": 1, "That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?": 1, "That's a quick way to the executioner's block.": 1, "That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.": 1, "That's a little... showy, even for you.": 1, "That's a fine looking animal you've got there. I had a dog once. Kept getting fur in my mead.": 1, "That's a fairly common experience, at least for those who remain coherent enough to report what they've seen.": 1, "That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle.": 1, "That's a fair price. My blade is yours.": 1, "That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.": 1, "That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.": 1, "That's Vokun, the guardian of the scroll.  It must be just past him.": 1, "That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas. ": 1, "That'll teach you.": 1, "That'll teach you to break the law on my watch.": 1, "That'll teach me to try and make extra coin around this city.": 1, "That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.": 1, "That's a nice trick, but it won't save your skin.": 1, "That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done.": 1, "That's all I can make out from this etching. I'll check the rest and see if there's anything else. You keep trying out the combinations.": 1, "That's all for today. You're dismissed.": 1, "That's far enough.": 1, "That's enough, Thongvor. We're done.": 1, "That's enough!": 1, "That's easy to say, but I definitely didn't help things.": 1, "That's done it! Look, it's coming to life!": 1, "That's done it! Let's get in there.": 1, "That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...": 1, "That's disgusting, get that rotting carcass away from me!": 1, "That's definitely safer. I'm not sure I'll risk summoning an Ash Guardian again myself. Too easy to forget about the heart stone!": 1, "That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.": 1, "That's correct. I'm glad to see someone else has been paying attention.": 1, "That's comforting. Glad they're keeping watch instead of getting rid of the draugr.": 1, "That's close enough, fool. Now you die!": 1, "That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.": 1, "That's all I need from you. Congratulations! I think you'll make an excellent parent.": 1, "That's certainly unusual.": 1, "That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!": 1, "That's between me and the spirits, Kuvar. You know that.": 1, "That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.": 1, "That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.": 1, "That's because you always lose... Elf.": 1, "That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.": 1, "That's always a possibility. She was almost as obsessed as my father by the time she shut me in.": 1, "That's all, hmm?": 1, "That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?": 1, "That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.": 1, "That's all there is to it, Dragonborn. Good luck.": 1, "That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.": 1, "That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson.": 1, "That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you.": 1, "That's certainly one way to get attention.": 1, "That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin.": 1, "That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way.": 1, "That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee.": 1, "That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!": 1, "That was the plan, yes. Assuming the rest of them can trust a vampire. Come on, I'll need you to help convince them.": 1, "That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.": 1, "That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.": 1, "That was some twenty years ago now.": 1, "That was quite an adventure we had, wasn't it?": 1, "That was my theory, you know. My research. My life's work. All of it, lost! Stolen by my own damn apprentice!": 1, "That was hardly worth my time.": 1, "That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.": 1, "That was foolish of you.": 1, "That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were here to do all the hard work.": 1, "That was delicious.": 1, "That was close...": 1, "That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on \"Ragnar\" and \"Red.\"": 1, "That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.": 1, "That was before you ruined that staff. Fix the staff and I'll teach you the spell.": 1, "That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing.": 1, "That was a long time ago, but the idea was, and is, a good one. That's why I'm bringing it back.": 1, "That was a little embarrassing.": 1, "That was a good bit of work.": 1, "That was a dark time in my life. I did a lot of things I ended up regretting.": 1, "That was a close one!": 1, "That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then...": 1, "That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...": 1, "That took longer than usual. How deep are we?": 1, "That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!": 1, "That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.": 1, "That they might get themselves killed. ": 1, "That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction.": 1, "That the best you can do?": 1, "That was almost two centuries ago. There may be nothing left to find.": 1, "That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.": 1, "That was you? You're the Dragonborn?": 1, "That was... not as useful as I would have liked. Even so, you did well.": 1, "That your best? Huh?": 1, "That you might remember.": 1, "That you have. Here.": 1, "That you have forgotten.": 1, "That would work, except you ain't got.": 1, "That would fit with the rest of it... I don't like it, but you did right to play along. We need to find out what this is all about.": 1, "That would be wonderful.": 1, "That would be splendid! I'd be more than happy to give you something for the effort.": 1, "That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now.": 1, "That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then.": 1, "That would be best.": 1, "That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.": 1, "That would be a shame. You were an interesting exception to the otherwise universal phenomenon.": 1, "That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me.": 1, "That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude.": 1, "That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos.": 1, "That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach. ": 1, "That wasn't a fair swing.": 1, "That wasn't a fight, it was an execution.": 1, "That wasn't what I meant.": 1, "That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.": 1, "That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The \"ninth\" divine. Heh.": 1, "That weapon breaks my wares, we're gonna have us a real problem...": 1, "That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it.": 1, "That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say.": 1, "That will make them all more upset to have one of their citizens slain, and under such flimsy pretense.": 1, "That witch was going to kill me soon, I just know it.": 1, "That woman and her Thalmor Justiciars have caused nothing but problems for the people of Skyrim.": 1, "That woman is never around when you need her.": 1, "That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...": 1, "That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work.": 1, "That whole thing with the standing stone was very odd. I'd just as soon forget about it.": 1, "That's what happens when you cross the Guild.": 1, "That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes.": 1, "That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way.": 1, "That's the Greybeards' business, not ours.": 1, "That's that.": 1, "That's that then.": 1, "That's strange...": 1, "That's so sweet of you.": 1, "That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.": 1, "That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.": 1, "That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else.": 1, "That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.": 1, "That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?": 1, "That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach.": 1, "That's right. I want to go out into the world and earn great glory. I want to hunt the deadliest creatures and claim vast riches.": 1, "That's right. I used to be a Vigilant, but we had a difference of opinion.": 1, "That's right. Home of the Redguards. The land of sand and seas.": 1, "That's the North Gate in case you forget.": 1, "That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.": 1, "That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss.": 1, "That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.": 1, "That's right, walk away while I'm still inclined to let you.": 1, "That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone.": 1, "That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure.": 1, "That's right! Worst innkeeper in all of Skyrim!": 1, "That's right! Papa helped me with the clasps, but I did all the links on my own.": 1, "That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.": 1, "That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers sneak up on you.": 1, "That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus.": 1, "That's really none of your business...": 1, "That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work.": 1, "That's quite a distance from here. What's his trade? He a blacksmith as well?": 1, "That's putting it mildly.": 1, "That's right. Don't be like me and have to learn the hard way. Here's the spell tome, and a heart stone so you can try it safely.": 1, "That's privileged information. Now move along.": 1, "That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?": 1, "That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.": 1, "That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires.": 1, "That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one.": 1, "That's what an old man gets for thinking the younger generation might be interested in learning some honor.": 1, "That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.": 1, "That's what I'm trying to do...": 1, "That's what I wanted to hear.": 1, "That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...": 1, "That's unfortunate.": 1, "That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house.": 1, "That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...": 1, "That's too bad. Do you know how they're doing now?": 1, "That's too bad. ": 1, "That's the wrong answer.": 1, "That's the way it is.": 1, "That's the end of that, hmm?": 1, "That's the way I like it. Short and bloody. They never knew what hit them.": 1, "That's the thing... what's the point of a moondial? I always wondered why she didn't just have the whole thing ripped out.": 1, "That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...": 1, "That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.": 1, "That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A heroine of the people. A true daughter of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.": 1, "That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A hero of the people. A true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.": 1, "That's the spirit.": 1, "That's the spirit!": 1, "That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside.": 1, "That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim...": 1, "That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all.": 1, "That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any.": 1, "That's the last one, isn't it? It's... it's almost time. I'll meet you at the Forge!": 1, "That's the last of them. Poor sods can't resist after they get a taste of your dosed Skooma.": 1, "That's the kind of attitude that's going to land you in prison, but I'll let it go for now.": 1, "That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes.": 1, "That's over half of the pages found. Keep it up!": 1, "That's one of them Imperial scholars, right? Old man with a gray robe?": 1, "That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.": 1, "That's it? Ha!": 1, "That's it? All right.": 1, "That's it...": 1, "That's it. That's the last scroll.": 1, "That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project...": 1, "That's it. Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom of this.": 1, "That's it, son. Make me proud.": 1, "That's it, out there to the north. We used to keep a boat around here to get there and back.": 1, "That's it! You've got one of them lined up!": 1, "That's it! You've collected every last verse. I can't thank you enough. This deserves a special bonus.": 1, "That's it! You're leaving, right now.": 1, "That's it! You found it!": 1, "That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!": 1, "That's it! That's my bow!": 1, "That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying.": 1, "That's it! I'm not retiring, ever! End of discussion!": 1, "That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on our heads.": 1, "That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.": 1, "That's impossible. Wait... unless she didn't actually die! The heart stone could have kept her right at the edge of life and death.": 1, "That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.": 1, "That's how the Legion fights.": 1, "That's how it's done.": 1, "That's how a true Nord fights.": 1, "That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.": 1, "That's how I ended up here. I can't rest. Not until I find the Forge, until I can prove that it was my discovery. Mine, not his!": 1, "That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it.": 1, "That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.": 1, "That's good. But until we can account for all the miners, I won't be able to recruit more. Keep searching. It should be safe now.": 1, "That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.": 1, "That's good enough for me. Go see what the vampires were looking for in this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there.": 1, "That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now.": 1, "That's it? That's all you've got?": 1, "That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is. ": 1, "That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?": 1, "That's of course if you're foolish enough to try it.": 1, "That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.": 1, "That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause. Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him.": 1, "That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.": 1, "That's not something you see every day...": 1, "That's not someone who lives in Raven Rock, I don't think... but it sounds so familiar.": 1, "That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.": 1, "That's not my problem.": 1, "That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.": 1, "That's not going to work.": 1, "That's not going to happen.": 1, "That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared.": 1, "That's not for you.": 1, "That's not for you to decide. Soldier.": 1, "That's not fair. We can still take it back.": 1, "That's not fair, now.": 1, "That's not a name I know. And it doesn't sound like a name a group of vampires would choose.": 1, "That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be.": 1, "That's just terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.": 1, "That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.": 1, "That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more.": 1, "That's kind of you, Lod.": 1, "That's mighty bold, strutting about like that, looking for a fight. This one will oblige if he must.": 1, "That's for the best.": 1, "That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.": 1, "That's my boy.": 1, "That's my brother up there.": 1, "That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!": 1, "That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it.": 1, "That's no small amount of coin, friend.": 1, "That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.": 1, "That's more like it.": 1, "The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.": 1, "The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.": 1, "The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.": 1, "The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.": 1, "The greatest of us grow magical towers like this one from the mighty fungus trees.": 1, "The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider. ": 1, "The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.": 1, "The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.": 1, "The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.": 1, "The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.": 1, "The gods will be the judge of that.": 1, "The gods smile on them who show charity. Best you remember that.": 1, "The gods know what you've done.": 1, "The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.": 1, "The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you.": 1, "The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!": 1, "The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament.": 1, "The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.": 1, "The giant air-floaters from the dark elf lands. Only the brave dare to hunt them, only the strong survive them.": 1, "The gate's unlocked. You can head inside when you're ready.": 1, "The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.": 1, "The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content.": 1, "The forge is hot today.": 1, "The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?": 1, "The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.": 1, "The food is better up here, too.": 1, "The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge.": 1, "The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!": 1, "The first vampire came from Molag Bal. She... was not a willing subject. But she was still the first.": 1, "The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.": 1, "The first piece of wisdom I teach to any hunter of the Skaal is to ask the simple question, should I truly kill this beast?": 1, "The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.": 1, "The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them.": 1, "The general expects so much with so little.": 1, "The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern that represents the absence of enlightenment.": 1, "The guardian spirits of Bear, Mammoth and Sabre Cat await you. Return when they are defeated.": 1, "The guards don't even dare go up there unless they've no choice.": 1, "The kind of things that even the College won't tolerate. Things that can get a wizard exiled for life.": 1, "The kind men use to measure themselves. ": 1, "The key to wards is that they take time to charge.": 1, "The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.": 1, "The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold.": 1, "The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn.": 1, "The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.": 1, "The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.": 1, "The items it made were so powerful they went to war over it, and the Forge was lost. Or so the story goes.": 1, "The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard. ": 1, "The inscription must be a reference to these pillars.": 1, "The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.": 1, "The ignorant think it is only a place of ash and lava.": 1, "The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.": 1, "The guards are looking for a killer, but who knows what else they might turn up? Good day.": 1, "The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet.": 1, "The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.": 1, "The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe.": 1, "The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.": 1, "The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain.": 1, "The historian has not stopped speaking your praises.": 1, "The herd is becoming distressed, which makes it more difficult for us to slip in and out undetected.": 1, "The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.": 1, "The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us.": 1, "The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!": 1, "The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.": 1, "The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.": 1, "The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.": 1, "The guards know who holds the purse strings in this city, and I don't like snoops.": 1, "The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...": 1, "The hostility was necessary. I was bound to an oath.": 1, "The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel.": 1, "The finest sujamma to cross your lips, friend. My own personal formula that I call \"Sadri's Sujamma.\"": 1, "The finest fish, here! Caught daily!": 1, "The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.": 1, "The dragons will surely fear your Voice.": 1, "The dragons of old have returned! By the All-Maker, I hope they will leave our village alone.": 1, "The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made.": 1, "The dovah roamed the skies, vying for their small slices of territory that resulted in immense and ultimately fatal battles.": 1, "The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially... attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable.": 1, "The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her.": 1, "The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.": 1, "The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit.": 1, "The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?": 1, "The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.": 1, "The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.": 1, "The destruction of our homeland, the exile of our people and the rebuilding of our civilization.": 1, "The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.": 1, "The dwarves may have stolen their sight, but it took many generations for them to become what they are today.": 1, "The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.": 1, "The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around! ": 1, "The dead exist to feed the living.": 1, "The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.": 1, "The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.": 1, "The day I refuse sujamma from Geldis is the day I sprout wings and fly off of this rock.": 1, "The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.": 1, "The darkness hums and we sing its praises. Sweet melodies. Sweet like the water that flows through their veins.": 1, "The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.": 1, "The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum.": 1, "The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift.": 1, "The damn thing sunk right off the coast of Solstheim. Can you imagine?": 1, "The damn fool doesn't even deserve to have it! The pickaxe was made for mining, not selling.": 1, "The dagger...? By Akatosh, they didn't even wrap it correctly?": 1, "The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time. ": 1, "The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.": 1, "The dwarves must have feared this book to lock it away like this.": 1, "The dwarves were a clever race. I wonder what happened to them?": 1, "The ears of the wind?": 1, "The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.": 1, "The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.": 1, "The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace.": 1, "The fields will need cutting soon.": 1, "The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.": 1, "The fever... my body burns...": 1, "The fetcher thought he could stir up the locals and use them against the Redoran Guard and then murder Councilor Morvayn when we weren't looking.": 1, "The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.": 1, "The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.": 1, "The feast never ends here in Castle Volkihar.": 1, "The feast has begun!": 1, "The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.": 1, "The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.": 1, "The fairest prices and the highest quality in Skyrim!": 1, "The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.": 1, "The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.": 1, "The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his soul-snare.": 1, "The effect around you looks an awful lot like that huge column of light shining on the dais.": 1, "The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.": 1, "The elders talk of great cities much bigger than our village, but why would anyone need so many buildings?": 1, "The endless wait gives way to battle! Alduin's doom, his death or ours!": 1, "The enemy is mustering for a final attack.": 1, "The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.": 1, "The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night.

The meaning of these stones has not.": 1, "The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.": 1, "The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.": 1, "The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress.": 1, "The knot gives the connection a strength that may be the key that I've been looking for.": 1, "The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same! ": 1, "The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.": 1, "The note says it's from General Falx Carius, but that's impossible.": 1, "The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks.": 1, "The night belongs to us.": 1, "The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.": 1, "The new meat. So soft. Tender.": 1, "The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet.": 1, "The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.": 1, "The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.": 1, "The nature of the favors varies per deity.

We could perhaps discover even more gifts of Hircine.": 1, "The more they worry, the more they talk about it. I've been hearing rumors for a bit now.": 1, "The more important question is: why are you here?": 1, "The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice.": 1, "The moondial definitely wasn't like this the last time I saw it.": 1, "The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good.

Why is it always so cold?": 1, "The only thing I can do.": 1, "The only reason you have the gold for your \"business\" is because I gave it to you.": 1, "The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.": 1, "The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.": 1, "The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.": 1, "The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death.": 1, "The only problem is, I'm going to need a lot of spears. A lot.

Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.": 1, "The only mistake was you showing your face. You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people, and it's time to face the Jarl's justice.": 1, "The only mistake here belongs to you. You're a wanted woman and there's no way I'm letting you walk away.": 1, "The old Nords sure did love their stonework.": 1, "The only mistake here belongs to you.

Terrible battles fought at the temple. The dragons burning it to the ground in rage.": 1, "The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?": 1, "The law will require proof that we can't present. And Jarls disapprove of bloodshed they haven't called for themselves.": 1, "The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right? ": 1, "The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.": 1, "The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.": 1, "The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out.

To Astrid, to the Family... and to me.": 1, "The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?": 1, "The last one was warm up.": 1, "The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity.": 1, "The last cube is somewhere through the northern door. We won't be able to open it until the water level is lower.": 1, "The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more swimming around in this filth.": 1, "The land provides all that I need. I have no use for your coins.": 1, "The land is out of balance.

Good thing I'm around to keep it up.": 1, "The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends.": 1, "The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.": 1, "The mine is rich, and so are we. ": 1, "The mine is just how I remember it.": 1, "The mine is closed. Get lost.": 1, "The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.": 1, "The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.": 1, "The mighty beast will fall and we will rise.": 1, "The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.": 1, "The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.": 1, "The men will be fighting in flames.": 1, "The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor.": 1, "The magical energies underneath the College still require purification.

That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...": 1, "The master has gone but Dervenin will find him. Dervenin should not have gone.": 1, "The kinship between us is gone. I don't understand what he's become, but he's no longer the brother I once knew.": 1, "The mead hall, up there on the hill. We were... some Rieklings have taken it over.": 1, "The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!": 1, "The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.": 1, "The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly.": 1, "The memories. I cannot stand them.

Spread out, and keep your eyes open.": 1, "The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.": 1, "The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.": 1, "The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed.": 1, "The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.": 1, "The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.": 1, "The Soul Cairn will offer a unique opportunity to continue my studies, and I intend to complete my research.": 1, "The Soul Cairn is home to very powerful beings. Necromancers send them souls, and receive powers of their own in return.": 1, "The Soul Cairn is a tiny sliver of Oblivion, the realm of the daedra.": 1, "The Soul Cairn has become a part of what I am. I can never fully call Tamriel my home again, or I would surely perish.": 1, "The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.": 1, "The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.": 1, "The Skyforge? Aye, my clan-fathers have worked it since the first Gray-Manes came to Whiterun.": 1, "The Skaal will one day look to Frea. I hope she will be there for them.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.": 1, "The Skaal value silence over needless talking.": 1, "The Skaal is a group of Nords who live up to the north of here. They're always talking about their connection to the natural world.": 1, "The Skaal hunt not for sport, but to survive.": 1, "The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library.": 1, "The Skaal have always avoided ruins such as these. Nothing of the All-Maker is to be found within.": 1, "The Skaal and the land are one, joined by the All-Maker.": 1, "The Silver-Bloods run nearly all the lands in this Hold, as well as the local inn.": 1, "The Silver-Bloods pay their debts. You have my thanks.": 1, "The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back.

Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.": 1, "The Skaal live in harmony with nature and take only what we need from the land.": 1, "The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive.

Stick close and follow orders so we don't stir up the whole place against us.": 1, "The Thalmor. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.": 1, "The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.": 1, "The Thalmor would need to make an example of me... I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations.": 1, "The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.": 1, "The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.": 1, "The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us.": 1, "The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis.

It wasn't exactly great for recruitment.": 1, "The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.": 1, "The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!": 1, "The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.": 1, "The Telvanni are the master wizards of Morrowind.": 1, "The Telvanni are amazing.

Not something I'd want to read.": 1, "The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.": 1, "The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim.

And the Forsworn were born.": 1, "The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!": 1, "The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!": 1, "The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that.": 1, "The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me.": 1, "The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood.

I give you its true power, mortal.": 1, "The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.": 1, "The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world.": 1, "The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude.": 1, "The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.": 1, "The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect there to be any further violence.": 1, "The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.": 1, "The Legion could really use someone like you, especially now.": 1, "The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name.

And we elves have long memories...": 1, "The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.": 1, "The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.": 1, "The Jarl's in danger. A vampire plays as a visiting \"advisor\" to the court. Destroy it before it's able to complete its foul business.": 1, "The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.": 1, "The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her thanes - and my profits - that are paying for this war.": 1, "The Jarl will definitely want to talk to you. You'll find him in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.": 1, "The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak.": 1, "The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him.": 1, "The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?": 1, "The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.": 1, "The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.": 1, "The Moth Priest can stay here for now. As for the vampire, I still don't trust it, so keep it on a leash.": 1, "The Night Mother is part of you now!

They mean to reclaim what was lost from the Tribunal's falsehoods and lies.": 1, "The Reach will be ours again.": 1, "The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first.": 1, "The Raven Rock road is dangerous. I hope nothing happened to Varona.": 1, "The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.": 1, "The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find.": 1, "The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.": 1, "The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.": 1, "The Poetic Edda is never truly complete. As a living history of Skyrim we Bards continually add parts to it.": 1, "The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city.

I don't appreciate them right back.": 1, "The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough.

I don't tolerate any disloyalty.": 1, "The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam.": 1, "The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory.": 1, "The Order shall rise.": 1, "The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.": 1, "The Nords drove them out of the city. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men. That was about 20 years ago.": 1, "The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.": 1, "The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city.

Use the bow!": 1, "The bow was said to be carried by Auri-El himself into battle against the forces of Lorkhan in ancient and mythic times.": 1, "The bow has to be in here.": 1, "The bow draws its power from Aetherius itself, channeling it through the sun.": 1, "The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground.": 1, "The boss went down there? Today?": 1, "The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!": 1, "The book is just inside.": 1, "The book is housed inside that dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Let's get on with it.": 1, "The book is housed in the main dome. I sealed the door the last time I was here, as a precaution against thieves and other meddlers.": 1, "The book in my dream showed me...": 1, "The boilers won't work if they're flooded, you know.": 1, "The boilers in the Great Hall provide steam to the reading room upstairs, which we need in order to open the book's protective case.": 1, "The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...": 1, "The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?": 1, "The bloodiest beef in the Reach! Ha ha ha.": 1, "The blood of wolves runs through your veins, Skaal-friend.": 1, "The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar. Now then...": 1, "The blood of a vampire... Auriel's Bow...": 1, "The blood of Markarth is silver.": 1, "The boss said it's some sort of profaned spring. It looks like blood, but it's not the real thing.": 1, "The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well.": 1, "The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.": 1, "The ceremony was... degrading.": 1, "The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it. ": 1, "The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife.": 1, "The cowards!": 1, "The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock.": 1, "The corpse is to be the message, not the attack.": 1, "The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.": 1, "The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar.": 1, "The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.": 1, "The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different.": 1, "The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.": 1, "The conquering hero returns!": 1, "The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.": 1, "The connecting soul thread is knotted three times, once for the heart, once for the spirit, and once for the body.": 1, "The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history.": 1, "The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward. ": 1, "The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana.": 1, "The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen.": 1, "The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.": 1, "The chests of gold didn't hurt.": 1, "The chief wanted me to tell you... your boyfriend was real nice to us while you were gone.": 1, "The chief wanted me to tell you... your girlfriend was real nice to us while you were gone.": 1, "The child is spirited, but lacks... agency. ": 1, "The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for.": 1, "The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them.": 1, "The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.": 1, "The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.": 1, "The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?": 1, "The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss.": 1, "The city is yours.": 1, "The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill.": 1, "The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.": 1, "The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.": 1, "Things proceeding well, Listener?": 1, "The blessing of Arkay be upon you.": 1, "The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more.": 1, "The air here... it feels different. Almost like...": 1, "The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.": 1, "The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined.

What do you want?": 1, "The air is different. We are safe, which means you have succeeded.": 1, "The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?": 1, "The Vigilants of Stendarr, in over their heads. What a surprise.": 1, "The Vigilants mostly hunt down daedra worshippers, which is why they got torn to pieces when they went up against vampires.": 1, "The Vigil will be watching you.": 1, "The Vigil of Stendarr cleanses all Daedric filth from Tamriel. Give us any artifacts you have, or we'll purge you like all the others.": 1, "The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time.": 1, "The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names.": 1, "The Ulen family being a part of House Hlaalu didn't matter.": 1, "The Ulen Family of House Hlaalu, a rival Great House, has placed a deathmark on the councilor's head.": 1, "The Tyranny of the Sun has been broken!": 1, "The Twilight watches us all, guardian.": 1, "The Twilight has foreseen all of this.

Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem.": 1, "The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.": 1, "The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.": 1, "The best tales are those of adventure.

If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost.": 1, "The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now.

Let's head back.": 1, "The amulets increase the effectiveness of your vampiric powers.": 1, "The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.": 1, "The answer is no, I tell you! Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!": 1, "The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.": 1, "The architecture of this temple is marvelous. Have you ever seen stonework like this, Delphine?": 1, "The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.": 1, "The blast from the volcano wiped most of them out.": 1, "The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.": 1, "The ash from the Red Mountain has made the land sick.": 1, "The ash spawn attacks on the Bulwark are getting worse. Captain Veleth is trying his best, but I think the Redoran Guard are overwhelmed.": 1, "The ashfall in the south kills the plants upon which the small creatures feed.": 1, "The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.": 1, "The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully.

And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up.": 1, "The ash from Red Mountain holds secrets. Secrets I mean to uncover.": 1, "If you want answers, ask at the inn. She told me she was staying there.": 1, "Things seem just as bleak here.": 1, "Think I'll be sad when we're done collecting these. Who knows though, maybe more plans will turn up in the future.": 1, "We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.": 1, "We could always look for another brand.": 1, "We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.": 1, "We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?": 1, "We carry just about anything you could need...": 1, "We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking?": 1, "We cannot fight the foe in this mist!": 1, "We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!": 1, "We cannot afford to relax.": 1, "We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.": 1, "We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.": 1, "We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!": 1, "We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.": 1, "We can't hold them! Go, Casimir! Run!": 1, "We could fix you right up.": 1, "We can't hold them back! Go! Get to the Barrier! Release the Miasma!": 1, "We can't give up. There's no one else to stand against these monsters.": 1, "We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.": 1, "We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.": 1, "We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.": 1, "We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master.": 1, "We can trade when there's light outside.": 1, "We can trade in the morning, outlander.": 1, "We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.": 1, "We can talk after I've gotten the blessing.": 1, "We can speak after the ceremony's done.": 1, "We can sort out the details of our little arrangement later, but for now, I'll manage the dig if you can manage the coin.": 1, "We can shatter his power if we Shout together!": 1, "We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.": 1, "We can meet you there, or all travel together, your call.": 1, "We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.": 1, "We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste.": 1, "We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.": 1, "We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.": 1, "We don't want your kind here, dark elves!": 1, "We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.": 1, "We don't stand a chance!": 1, "We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?": 1, "We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it.": 1, "We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.": 1, "We don't need competition for blood, and we don't want the mortals getting up in arms making things difficult for us.": 1, "We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly.": 1, "We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?": 1, "We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight.": 1, "We don't have travelers from Elsweyr or Hammerfell anymore, Endon. Only the natives and the Nords stay in Markarth now.": 1, "We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this.": 1, "We don't have many other options, do we?": 1, "We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course.": 1, "We could just \"pay the toll\" another way. It wants a soul, so we give it a soul. Yours.": 1, "We don't get many people like you visiting Winterhold. Usually it's elves.": 1, "We don't fight, son. We, um, talk. Loudly.": 1, "We don't even know what's inside. And besides, there's... the curse.": 1, "We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.": 1, "We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared.": 1, "We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger.": 1, "We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever.": 1, "We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.": 1, "We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.": 1, "We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.": 1, "We didn't listen to him any more than we did Isran. He was at the Hall when it was attacked...": 1, "We didn't all get to have parents like yours. Sometimes this is just... how it is.": 1, "We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.": 1, "We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your accomplishments...": 1, "We could use someone with your skills.": 1, "We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.": 1, "We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!": 1, "We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.": 1, "We can do this thing.": 1, "We are one of the great houses that rule Morrowind.": 1, "We are if I have anything to say about it.": 1, "We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.": 1, "We are done talking about this.": 1, "We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity.": 1, "We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?": 1, "We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.": 1, "We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars! ": 1, "We are bound to this land, like a great pine with roots that run as deep as the tree is tall.": 1, "We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void.": 1, "We are blood bound, but we can never be too careful. Never know who might be watching, right? ": 1, "We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be.": 1, "We are all in your debt, Dragonborn.": 1, "We are all blood here. One family, one tribe.": 1, "We are only safe so long as we concentrate...": 1, "We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?": 1, "We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.": 1, "We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.": 1, "We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.": 1, "We already owe you much, but I must ask you for one more thing.": 1, "We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.": 1, "We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us.": 1, "We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.": 1, "We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done.": 1, "We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman.": 1, "We all come into Arkay's light in the end, but there's no need to rush.": 1, "We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck.": 1, "We agreed to 750 gold. I want my money.": 1, "We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye.": 1, "We Skaal do not fear death. We know we will return to the All-Maker and be born anew.": 1, "We are Nords, much like those you'll find in Skyrim. Long ago our path diverged from that of our cousins on the mainland.": 1, "We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!": 1, "We are ready to mount our final attack.": 1, "We are special envoys of the Aldmeri Dominion, the rightful rulers of Tamriel. If you'd like I can show you why. ": 1, "We came across some old letters that belonged to his great-grandfather in our house and he believes every word written in them.": 1, "We call you a friend, but you must still respect our ways.": 1, "We call them the True Tribunal because they have reclaimed their place in our hearts from the false Tribunal that came before.": 1, "We call such confluences the \"Daughters of Coldharbour.\"": 1, "We built great works there, like Vivec and Ald'ruhn. Many of them are destroyed now, either by Red Mountain or the argonian invasion.": 1, "We brought ourselves out here, along with our shame.": 1, "We bring honor to the Companions.": 1, "We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.": 1, "We bring his compassion where none can be found, by cleansing all those who would offend his children.": 1, "We both realized that if Isran's even allowed us in here, he must be really concerned.": 1, "We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems.": 1, "We both leave well enough alone.": 1, "We both know what's going to have to happen once we find the bow.": 1, "We both know that a band of fools with crossbows is no match for a scion of the ancient blood.": 1, "We better get moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.": 1, "We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.": 1, "We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.": 1, "We are still but a shadow of our glorious past, but some day we will rise again.": 1, "We are strong. We get the job done.": 1, "We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis.": 1, "We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.": 1, "We are the rightful rulers of Markarth!": 1, "We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube.": 1, "We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us.": 1, "We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored. ": 1, "We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.": 1, "We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way.": 1, "We aren't the bad guys you know.": 1, "We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.": 1, "We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?": 1, "We believe that all creatures have a right to live as they will, and when we take what we need from them, we thank the beast for its gifts. ": 1, "We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man.": 1, "We Skaal are not like you. We do not seek adventure, we wish only to live in peace and to honor our traditions. I hope you understand.": 1, "We earned this.": 1, "We family. We strong, you stronger. ": 1, "We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune.": 1, "We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.": 1, "We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "We lost most of the batches we had brewing when... before those things were here.": 1, "We lost everything.": 1, "We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl.": 1, "We lived in a settlement perhaps a league from the border of Black Marsh, the homeland of the Argonians. ": 1, "We live by his code and follow his teachings. Spend some time with the wise woman and you'll remember.": 1, "We live by his code and follow his teachings. An outlander like you wouldn't understand.": 1, "We live as one with the land, for the land provides all that we need. ": 1, "We left together, but that partnership didn't last very long. I didn't agree with some of his methods.": 1, "We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place.  My family is in there.": 1, "We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.": 1, "We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial...": 1, "We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do.": 1, "We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.": 1, "We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur.": 1, "We knew you would succeed.": 1, "We knew Isran was working on something, but we had no idea he'd found this place.": 1, "We killed it! I can't believe it!": 1, "We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go.": 1, "We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No. ": 1, "We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.": 1, "We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work.": 1, "We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?": 1, "We just need... we need help.": 1, "We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!": 1, "We just keep waiting for Bujold to say the word...": 1, "We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.": 1, "We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time.": 1, "We know him as Herma-Mora, the Demon of Knowledge. It is in his nature to hoard secrets to himself. Their value to him is of no consequence.": 1, "We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories.": 1, "We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality.": 1, "We may feed again today.": 1, "We need strength, power. Not magic. Elves don't seem to understand that.": 1, "We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.": 1, "We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any.": 1, "We need a total of five cubes - one to operate the pumps in the Great Hall, the other four to activate the boilers.": 1, "We must tell Storn what we have seen.": 1, "We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!": 1, "We must move quickly to prevent further violence.": 1, "We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands.": 1, "We must look to the All-Maker for guidance in these dark times.": 1, "We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place.": 1, "We must leave this place!": 1, "We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.": 1, "We must have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.": 1, "We must gather our strength. Who knows what's inside?": 1, "We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life.": 1, "We must find out what is at work here.": 1, "We must be prepared to face them.": 1, "We must be near the entrance for that bear to make its den here.": 1, "We must be near the entrance for that bear to have made its den here.": 1, "We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.": 1, "We must be careful in these ruins. Traps can be anywhere, and there will likely be many.": 1, "We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.": 1, "We must Shout together these shadows to dispel.": 1, "We mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes.": 1, "We might well be the first to set foot in here since this tomb was sealed.": 1, "We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?": 1, "We meet again. That was quite the trek.": 1, "We meet again, serjo. Speak your mind.": 1, "We mean you no harm, but... be on your way.": 1, "We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one.": 1, "We must clear this confounding mist.": 1, "We hunt down and kill vampires. Haven't you been paying attention? ": 1, "We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels.": 1, "We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.": 1, "We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished.": 1, "We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner.": 1, "We have all sorts of authentic dark elf food and drink here. Geldis spares no expense.": 1, "We have a relationship of mutual respect.": 1, "We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you.": 1, "We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.": 1, "We have Auriel's Bow. We can't lose... right?": 1, "We hardly ever get new customers anymore.": 1, "We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl.": 1, "We had the advantage of surprise this time, but things won't be so easy from here on out.": 1, "We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out.": 1, "We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out.": 1, "We had no standing army at the time, just uncoordinated pockets of resistance.": 1, "We had better do something about it, then.": 1, "We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.": 1, "We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.": 1, "We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.": 1, "We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.": 1, "We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.": 1, "We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?": 1, "We go up, yes? Always up.": 1, "We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.": 1, "We get by trading odds and ends with the locals. I've decided to stay here and make sure she passes in peace. It's the least I can do for her.": 1, "We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship.": 1, "We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison.": 1, "We fought them off, but... ": 1, "We forge every day if you need anything.": 1, "We follow our hearts.": 1, "We fight. You strong. You help. No more bad Nords.": 1, "We fight!": 1, "We had always maintained an uneasy alliance with the underground-dwelling dwarves, and when faced with extinction we turned to them for help.": 1, "We have come south to test our worth against the mighty Netch. Will you join us?": 1, "We have enough problems around here without having to build that blasted thing outside. Thanks for helping us wake up and move off it.": 1, "We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found.": 1, "We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!": 1, "We heard the news at Cloud Ruler by courier, riding hard from the Imperial City.": 1, "We haven't had an adoption in months. At this rate, we'll be stuck with these brats forever. We need to get the word out. A sale, if need be.": 1, "We haven't gotten anywhere ourselves with...": 1, "We haven't forgotten your crimes, outlander.": 1, "We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there.": 1, "We haven't been expecting you, and the old man needs his rest. Come back some other time.": 1, "We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased.": 1, "We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then.": 1, "We have to keep my mother alive!": 1, "We have to go through town and across the bridge to get to Bleak Falls Barrow.": 1, "We have to go out there before she disappears again.": 1, "We have to find the other pieces, of course. There should be, hmm... three more. One for each of the four cities that worked on the Forge.": 1, "We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.": 1, "We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.": 1, "We have the cubes that we need to start the boilers. Let's not waste any more time.": 1, "We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.": 1, "We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.": 1, "We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin.": 1, "We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully.": 1, "We have lived on Solstheim for many generations. Our people are tied to the land itself.": 1, "We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us into giving up our secrets to him.": 1, "We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.": 1, "We end this here and now!": 1, "We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things.": 1, "We have nothing to say to each other.": 1, "We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.": 1, "We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.": 1, "We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too.": 1, "We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.": 1, "We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you.": 1, "We have not finished speaking yet. Come back at once.": 1, "We need to destroy him before he turns his comrades into a brood of vampires.": 1, "We Orc men are not like these Nords and Imperials who carry on until they are grey and feeble and their hair falls out.": 1, "We Nords have a long history as warrior poets. I am proud to count myself among them.": 1, "Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?": 1, "Vittoria! There's someone I'd like you to meet.": 1, "Vittoria! No!": 1, "Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them.": 1, "Vittoria is practically glowing.": 1, "Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all.": 1, "Visitors to the city usually stay at the Silver-Blood Inn.": 1, "Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.": 1, "Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.": 1, "Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.": 1, "Vision? What vision are you talking about? Oh, no matter.": 1, "Vipir \"the Fleet.\" The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess.": 1, "Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge.": 1, "Violence is not our way, outsider.": 1, "Voada, you spilled laundry water in the soup pot again! Do I need to cut off your fingers to teach you a lesson?": 1, "Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us.": 1, "Vingalmo and Orthjolf both long for our Lord's throne, but cannot make overt moves against him.": 1, "Vingalmo and Orthjolf are Harkon's primary advisors. I'm sure they're quite surprised to learn that you're taking the Chalice.": 1, "Vilur tried to run, but he was caught by Captain Veleth himself.": 1, "Vilur Ulen wasn't the first Ulen to live in Raven Rock. His father, Valin Ulen, was one of the first Dunmer to settle here.": 1, "Vilur Ulen was executed a short time later and his remains placed in the Ulen Ancestral Tomb.": 1, "Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good.": 1, "Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.": 1, "Viinturuth! Ziil gro dovah ulse!": 1, "Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him \"Vignar the Revered.\"": 1, "Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold.": 1, "Victory... for now.": 1, "Victory to the Dawnguard!": 1, "Victory or death!": 1, "Victory or Sovngarde!": 1, "Vingalmo, is there... can I do anything for you?": 1, "Victorious again.": 1, "Vobalaam in! Dovahkiin los nu thuri!": 1, "Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place...": 1, "Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!": 1, "Wait! Don't tell me! I want to guess!": 1, "Wait! ...Yes, yes there is. The shards we collected... they're pure Aetherium, remember? It's not much, but it'll do.": 1, "Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk.": 1, "Wait until the boys hear about this.": 1, "Wait just one moment...": 1, "Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!": 1, "Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn.": 1, "Wait here. I'll be right back with your reward.": 1, "Wait for me.": 1, "Wait a moment... you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your mind?": 1, "Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in.": 1, "Wait a moment while I cast a more specific divination.": 1, "Wafoo athaaaal.": 1, "Volumes written on Durnehviir allege that he can't be slain by normal means. It appears they were mistaken.": 1, "Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack.": 1, "Waaah!": 1, "Waaaaaah!": 1, "Waaaaaaah....": 1, "Waaaaaaah!": 1, "Waaaaaaaah!": 1, "W...Where's the sun?": 1, "Vyrthur and myself are the only two snow elves that remain.": 1, "Vvardenfell's Red Mountain erupts. Try to be precise, Jorn.": 1, "Vvardenfell is covered in ash. Red Mountain makes sure of that.": 1, "Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure.": 1, "Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil.": 1, "Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.": 1, "Vuljotnaak! Ziil gro dovah ulse!": 1, "Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself.": 1, "Waayaruu?": 1, "Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.": 1, "Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!": 1, "Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?": 1, "Very well, let's try this again...": 1, "Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements.": 1, "Very well, let's keep moving.": 1, "Very well, if you need my help, seek me out here in the village.": 1, "Very well, here.": 1, "Very well, cover the difference from my personal treasury.": 1, "Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him.": 1, "Very well, Thongvor. With the Stormcloaks here to help, the Silver-Blood family control nearly every route in and out of the city.": 1, "Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity.": 1, "Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head.": 1, "Very well, Listener.": 1, "Very well, I'll try milady.": 1, "Very well, I'll take a look at it later.": 1, "Very well, I'll keep practicing them.": 1, "Very well, master.": 1, "Very well, I'll ask Edla to trade for some coal.": 1, "Very well then, you leave me no choice!": 1, "Very well then, back to work.": 1, "Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.": 1, "Very supportive.": 1, "Very much so.": 1, "Very much so, yes.": 1, "Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.": 1, "Very little. It's an uncertain time. ": 1, "Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then.": 1, "Very good. Then we're done here.": 1, "Very good. That's one less monster we need to worry about. ": 1, "Very good. That should, for a time, direct the people's anger towards the Dawnguard and away from us.": 1, "Very good. Should you visit him again, I suspect you'll find our new sibling appreciates his transformation.": 1, "Very good. Should you visit her again, I suspect you'll find our new sibling appreciates her transformation.": 1, "Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant.": 1, "Very well, mother. I will stay for now.": 1, "Very well, please use it for food.": 1, "Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.": 1, "Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.": 1, "Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?": 1, "Vex?": 1, "Vex! Put it away... right now.": 1, "Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up.": 1, "Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king...": 1, "Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word.": 1, "Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.": 1, "Very well. Keep at it. You may go.": 1, "Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals.": 1, "Very well. If you change your mind, you can usually find me here. In the meantime, feel free to look around.": 1, "Very well. I'm ready, Elder.": 1, "Very well. I'll send a request for additional Legionnaires to protect trade to the other Imperial holds. Hopefully Solitude can spare more men.": 1, "Very well. I'll hurry on my way there before more of those vampires turn up.": 1, "Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will.": 1, "Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.": 1, "Very well. I suppose a moment or two of my time couldn't hurt.": 1, "Very well, then.": 1, "Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now...": 1, "Very well, you have convinced me. We will depart the island shortly and seek our weapons elsewhere.": 1, "Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words.": 1, "Very well, you're free to go. Next time you might not be so lucky.": 1, "Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.": 1, "Wait, I can still fight. No, no I can't.": 1, "Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave.": 1, "Very well. Here, take this for your troubles.": 1, "Very well. I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you what we are.": 1, "Very well. I can't stop you. But I can't bear to watch it, either. ": 1, "Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah.": 1, "Very well. I respect your discretion.": 1, "Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.": 1, "Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne.": 1, "We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today.": 1, "Wait, I hear something...": 1, "Wait, is he talking about me?": 1, "Watch out! We have company!": 1, "Watch out! My equipment is fragile.": 1, "Watch out! He's pulling down the ceiling!": 1, "Watch out some gray-skin doesn't pick your pocket.": 1, "Watch out for pressure plates here.": 1, "Watch it, there, sister.": 1, "Watch it, there, brother.": 1, "Watch it with that thing!": 1, "Watch it Tilisu, I think we might have a visitor!": 1, "Waste of time.": 1, "Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?": 1, "Wasn't your business, anyway.": 1, "Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.": 1, "Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?": 1, "Watch out, the water's rising even higher with both pumps shut down.": 1, "Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain.": 1, "Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn.": 1, "Was there something specific you needed?": 1, "Was it... did Hrothmund recognize anyone else? Was it you? Is that why...": 1, "Was it something I said?": 1, "Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?": 1, "Was it Molag? No, no... Little Tim, the toymaker's son? The ghost of King Lysandus? Or was it... Yes! Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall.": 1, "Was it \"Having the adoration of thousands...\" No, wait. I could make it \"the adoration of tens of thousands.\"": 1, "Was it \"Between the forces of good and evil.\"? No, no... that's not it...": 1, "Was is that obvious? Damn. I must be losing my touch.": 1, "Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?": 1, "Was Jarl Ulfric with you?": 1, "Was I wrong? ": 1, "Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory.": 1, "Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you.": 1, "Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.": 1, "Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.": 1, "Watch out. Wolves.": 1, "Watch the blades.": 1, "We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too.": 1, "We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.": 1, "We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air.": 1, "We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.": 1, "Way I hear it, Lady Serana's been gone a real long time.": 1, "Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!": 1, "Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting.": 1, "Watch yourself. This bear is vicious.": 1, "Watch yourself. Since the quake, this place has been pretty unstable.": 1, "Watch yourself, lizard.": 1, "Watch yourself, cat.": 1, "Watch yourself out there... looks like an ash storm might be brewing.": 1, "Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.": 1, "Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.": 1, "Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow.": 1, "Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps.": 1, "Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.": 1, "Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn.": 1, "Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here.": 1, "Watch your step.": 1, "Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.": 1, "Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?": 1, "Watch your hands around the Legate.": 1, "Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!": 1, "Watch your back.": 1, "Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you.": 1, "Watch what you're doing.": 1, "Watch this.": 1, "Watch the recoil. Takes some getting used to.": 1, "Watch the eyes!": 1, "Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe.": 1, "Warlocks practice all sorts of foul sorcery. We should proceed with caution.": 1, "War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!": 1, "War may be good for business, but it's hard on families.": 1, "Wait... who are you? Intruder!": 1, "Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.": 1, "Wait... Serana? Is that truly you? I cannot believe my eyes!": 1, "Wait... I....": 1, "Wait... I know you.": 1, "Wait... I hear something!": 1, "Wait. You're that new bard, the one who saved the Festival. Aren't you?": 1, "Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone.": 1, "Wait. You there. Step forward.": 1, "Wait. There's something different about you.": 1, "Wait. Something's wrong.": 1, "Wait. Something's happening... gods above!": 1, "Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send him in.": 1, "Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send her in.": 1, "Wait... who in blazes is this?": 1, "Wait. Did you hear that? I think it came this way.": 1, "Wait.": 1, "Wait, where did you get this? This piece was thought to be lost forever, please take this with my utmost thanks!": 1, "Wait, what? That's not what we agreed. We take it back together.": 1, "Wait, what?": 1, "Wait, what are you doing?": 1, "Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?": 1, "Wait, stop! I yield!": 1, "Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious...": 1, "Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?": 1, "Wait, please! Don't leave me for the wolves to find!": 1, "Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face.": 1, "Wait, let me guess. You'll get to it later.": 1, "Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute...": 1, "Wait, is that a tail?": 1, "Wait. Are you... Are you serious?": 1, "Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?": 1, "Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!": 1, "Waiting for what?": 1, "War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some.": 1, "War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment.": 1, "Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.": 1, "Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.": 1, "Want to head out there and collect some more?": 1, "Want to buy anything, or just laugh at our misfortunes?": 1, "Want my advice? Avoid getting wrapped up in Vingalmo's schemes. He's after the throne, and he'll kill anyone that gets in his way.": 1, "Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?": 1, "Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?": 1, "Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.": 1, "Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too.": 1, "Wander, gather.": 1, "Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe.": 1, "Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion.": 1, "Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.": 1, "Walking in these chambers is like walking in the past.": 1, "Walking around with your weapon out is bound to make people nervous. We understand each other? ": 1, "Wake me up when you're ready to fight me for real.": 1, "Wake up. Wake up!": 1, "Walk always in shadow, my Listener.": 1, "Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness.": 1, "Walk always in the light, or we will drag you to it.": 1, "Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.": 1, "Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!": 1, "Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!": 1, "Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis.": 1, "Walk into the the wrong place with your weapon drawn? You might not walk out again....": 1, "Walk with the All-Maker, Skaal-friend.": 1, "Walked right into a trap, and didn't even realize it until I was captured.": 1, "Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here.": 1, "Walking around like that is why magic gets a bad name. Shame on you.": 1, "Walk away. Now.": 1, "Very good. Let's continue with our practice.": 1, "We need to do all that nonsense to get into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?": 1, "We need to find a way into the temple below.": 1, "Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.": 1, "Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me.": 1, "Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta.": 1, "Welcome to Bits and Pieces. I'm sure you'll find what you need here.": 1, "Welcome to Belethor's General Goods. Welcome, indeed.": 1, "Welcome back.": 1, "Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed.": 1, "Welcome back! Good to see you again.": 1, "Welcome back to the temple, messenger.": 1, "Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.": 1, "Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.": 1, "Wealth is my business. Help me out and I can add to yours. Would you like a taste?": 1, "Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.": 1, "We... we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...": 1, "Welcome to Raven Rock, traveler. Could I interest you in any fine ash-grown foods?": 1, "We... don't have enough to...": 1, "We've... developed quite the reputation. But for enough gold... I can do it. Just barely.": 1, "We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.": 1, "We've talked about composure, speed, and precision.": 1, "We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours.": 1, "We've no need for wizards in our midst!": 1, "We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.": 1, "We've made it to the courtyard.": 1, "We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.": 1, "We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal.": 1, "We've lost a lot of good people to that damn crusade. Drive out the Nords, they say. Well, the Nord ain't driven out.": 1, "We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.": 1, "We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.": 1, "We've had two other assaults on the Bulwark at different spots on the wall.": 1, "We've got work to do.": 1, "We, uh... we were delayed by bad weather.": 1, "We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.": 1, "Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you.": 1, "Welcome to Shor's Stone.": 1, "Welcome to the politics of Lord Harkon's court.": 1, "Welcome to the family, lass. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.": 1, "Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.": 1, "Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch. ": 1, "Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.": 1, "Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...": 1, "Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend.": 1, "Welcome to the Warrens.": 1, "Welcome to the Vilemyr Inn. If there's anything I can get you, just let me know.": 1, "Welcome to the Retching Netch, outlander. What can I get you?": 1, "Welcome to the Retching Netch Cornerclub, milord.

If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.": 1, "Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?": 1, "Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin.": 1, "Welcome to our home.": 1, "Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right on in. ": 1, "Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now you, my girl, have definitely come to the right place.": 1, "Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now don't let the name worry you - we got plenty o' steel for fightin' men.": 1, "Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.": 1, "Welcome to the Midden.": 1, "We've got to stay focused.": 1, "We've got to get this bridge down.": 1, "We've got to get inside. Now!": 1, "We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts. ": 1, "We've been so terribly fortunate. I can't wait to see what's in these drawings.": 1, "We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir. ": 1, "We've been looking for someone to join us in a hunt.": 1, "We've been keeping this collection since the Second Era. Books have come and gone during that time, but it's mostly intact.": 1, "We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?": 1, "We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect.": 1, "We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!": 1, "We've been contracted to make sure Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle in affairs that aren't his own.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Windhelm.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Morthal.": 1, "We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Markarth.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.": 1, "We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.": 1, "We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.": 1, "We've already lost my mother, I don't want to leave him alone.": 1, "We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.": 1, "We're with you!": 1, "We're wise to your scheming, you coward.": 1, "We're vampire hunters. We search out and destroy those bloodsucking scum wherever we find them.": 1, "We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing.": 1, "We're the victims of some evil magic, but why?": 1, "We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.": 1, "We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.": 1, "We're the ones he loves. Me, and you.": 1, "We're the mightiest of the Great Houses and we lead the Council, the ruling body of Morrowind.": 1, "We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.": 1, "We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming.": 1, "We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.": 1, "We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.": 1, "We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.": 1, "We've got to find a way out of here.": 1, "We've got to find Thorald quickly!": 1, "We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us.": 1, "We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy.": 1, "We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Wolf pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Sabre Cat pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Bear pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Sabre Cat pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Ice Wolf pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Cave Bear pelts.": 1, "We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Bear pelts.": 1, "We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing.": 1, "We've got our eyes on you.": 1, "We've got our eyes on you, scale-skin.": 1, "We've got nothing to talk about.": 1, "We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside.": 1, "We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.": 1, "We've fought quite a few battles together, and saved each other's lives on more than one occasion.": 1, "We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.": 1, "We've got a crew on it. They're not sharp, but they're working hard. Come back soon and see how they're doing.": 1, "We've got a new order in.": 1, "Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!": 1, "We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work.": 1, "We've got an old saying -- the Gray-Manes have lived in Whiterun since the first snows fell in Skyrim. ": 1, "We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.": 1, "We've got arms and armor of all kinds.": 1, "We've got enough to worry about right now. You stay focused, and I'll worry about me.": 1, "We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him.": 1, "We've got honor. Wealth and titles, too. Aye, and buxom women to warm your bed on a cold Skyrim night.": 1, "We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!": 1, "We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are. ": 1, "Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Illumination.": 1, "Welcome, brother.": 1, "Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?": 1, "Well now. I guess I owe you my thanks.": 1, "Well now. Funny you should ask.": 1, "Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that...": 1, "Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time.": 1, "Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.": 1, "Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please.": 1, "Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.": 1, "Well now! That's a shamefully absurd way to go around in public.": 1, "Well now! Aren't you putting on quite the show?": 1, "Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?": 1, "Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane. ": 1, "Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak.": 1, "Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck.": 1, "Well now... would you look at that.": 1, "Well met, traveler. What brings you to Whiterun?": 1, "Well met, kinsman. What brings you to Whiterun?": 1, "Well met, kinsman.": 1, "Well met, friend. We've been chasing that fiend for a long time. On behalf of the Vigil, you have my thanks.": 1, "Well met, friend. May we all fight or die well.": 1, "Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into.": 1, "Well met, friend. How can I help you?": 1, "Well met, friend.": 1, "Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today.": 1, "Well met, Adril.": 1, "Well maybe if you would finally convince Thongvor to put you in charge of the family, I wouldn't need to question you anymore.": 1, "Well let's not waste time talking about it, then!": 1, "Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?": 1, "Well let's move then!": 1, "Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous...": 1, "Well met, traveler.": 1, "Well it was... Thank the Vigilants for ruining that.": 1, "Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!": 1, "Well of course we do. I'm old, not stupid.": 1, "Well then, your timing couldn't be better.": 1, "Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it.": 1, "Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!": 1, "Well then, you should know better than anyone that Hermaeus Mora is not to be trifled with.": 1, "Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay.": 1, "Well then, look. Look all you want. And when you're done looking, maybe we can get some work done.": 1, "Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now.": 1, "Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken.": 1, "Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill.": 1, "Well then, consider it done.": 1, "Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?": 1, "Well then, I suppose I'm off to do what I do best.": 1, "Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.": 1, "Well then I'm very sorry, but I just can't walk away from this project yet.": 1, "Well of course they did.": 1, "Well then \"observe\" from a greater distance. You're making people uncomfortable.": 1, "Well that's unexpected.": 1, "Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.": 1, "Well that's just fine. Orthjolf told me to finish off anyone who got in the way.": 1, "Well that sounds lovely. Thank you.": 1, "Well that much is good. Let's finish this first war before starting the next one, eh?": 1, "Well that gives me a lot to think about. I need to get back to Tel Mithryn. I have some ideas about how to locate more of these Black Books...": 1, "Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it.": 1, "Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?": 1, "Well someone has to provide around here.": 1, "Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?": 1, "Well one of us has to do something!": 1, "Well of course. With four other houses on the Council, someone has to keep the rabble organized.": 1, "Well of course, now that they're under House Redoran's protection, why would they want to go back to Mournhold?": 1, "Well of course, not with an attitude like that!": 1, "Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.": 1, "Well it stops now, and that's final!": 1, "Well if my layabout manservant fed me more, that wouldn't be a problem.": 1, "Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy.": 1, "Well Ulfric, you can't escape from me this time. ": 1, "Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.": 1, "Well I'll be! That'd be a sight to see.": 1, "Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business. ": 1, "Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.": 1, "Well I really would like to make sure I've corrected what happened last time.": 1, "Well I need to do some testing on this new weapon, and I was thinking a live target would be helpful.": 1, "Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.": 1, "Well I can't wait forever. Master Neloth keeps asking if I have his soul gems yet.": 1, "Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up. ": 1, "Well Arkay isn't going to intervene... not here, not now. Best point yourself towards Morthal, find a man named Falion.": 1, "Welcome. There are many things here that cannot be found elsewhere.": 1, "Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...": 1, "Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.": 1, "Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!": 1, "Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so.": 1, "Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim.": 1, "Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?": 1, "Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen.": 1, "Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town.": 1, "Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself.": 1, "Welcome, sister. It's been too long since we met another who shares our blood.": 1, "Welcome, sister.": 1, "Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf.": 1, "Welcome, my sister. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.": 1, "Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.": 1, "Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!": 1, "Welcome, child. ": 1, "Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself.": 1, "Welcome, brother. It's been too long since we met another who shares our blood.": 1, "Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.": 1, "Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later.": 1, "Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.": 1, "Well aren't you a strange one.": 1, "Well hey, that's not something you see every day.": 1, "Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it.": 1, "Well guess who really runs things around here? Me. I own the mines. I make the coin pass to the right hands.": 1, "Well fought, ya swinging bit of skeever bait.": 1, "Well fought, Dragonborn.": 1, "Well find her. Tell her I want apple cabbage stew, with some canis root tea.": 1, "Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more. ": 1, "Well enough, I suppose.": 1, "Well done...": 1, "Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it.": 1, "Well done. They never knew what hit them.": 1, "Well done. Nothing like a good kill to get the blood pumping, is there?": 1, "Well done. Here, a token of appreciation.": 1, "Well done. Here's your gold.": 1, "Well done. Here are some septims for your troubles.": 1, "Well done, well done indeed!": 1, "Well done, my champion. Your journey towards enlightenment has finally led you here, to my realm, as I knew it would.": 1, "Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open.": 1, "Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too.": 1, "Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do.": 1, "Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!": 1, "Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you.": 1, "Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend.": 1, "Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Sight.": 1, "Well done! I said you'd return victorious, Arkay wasn't so sure. Wield it bravely.": 1, "Well done! It looks like we can head in either direction. Since you seem to know what you're doing, why don't you lead the way?": 1, "Well done! Somehow I knew it would be you and Serana who found our moth priest.": 1, "Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.": 1, "Well done, indeed.": 1, "Well done, indeed. Please accept this as a sign of my thanks.": 1, "Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded.": 1, "Well done! I trust you'll put those to good use then.": 1, "We need to do something about these vampire attacks.": 1, "We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?": 1, "We're so dead...": 1, "We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.": 1, "We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly.": 1, "We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly.": 1, "We wandered around a bit and ended up in Morthal where we took temporary residence with Lami, the town's alchemist.": 1, "We usually feed on our visitors, but perhaps we'll make an exception in your case.": 1, "We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.": 1, "We used to be proud warriors of Thirsk Mead Hall. There, up on the hill.": 1, "We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though.": 1, "We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.": 1, "We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.": 1, "We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence.": 1, "We try to serve the All-Maker, to live in balance with nature, instead of exploiting it as others would.": 1, "We tried to start a new life on the mainland, remember? It was too dangerous. Vvardenfell isn't ready.": 1, "We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere.": 1, "We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.": 1, "We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?": 1, "We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.": 1, "We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.": 1, "We take only what we need, and so we preserve the oneness with the land.": 1, "We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.": 1, "We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller.": 1, "We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready.": 1, "We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping.": 1, "We still have to find the Forge itself. I had a lead on that, too.": 1, "We still have cubes to find.": 1, "We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?": 1, "We stashed what we couldn't carry, and I hid it with a trick I know. I can point you in the right direction, and we'll each go our separate ways.": 1, "We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand.": 1, "We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.": 1, "We sold all those lovely little necklaces you brought me today. Did you make them yourself?": 1, "We thought it would be so simple.": 1, "We shouldn't have left her there to die!": 1, "We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here.": 1, "We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an \"honorable\" Nord? Pure folly. ": 1, "We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead.": 1, "We work hard, try to do right by our families.": 1, "We won't give you any more trouble.": 1, "We will test ourselves. May the All-Maker not find us wanting.": 1, "We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.": 1, "We will see about this...": 1, "We will sate the hunger together.": 1, "We will prevail!": 1, "We will march on their lair and destroy those wretched abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world!": 1, "We will make do somehow. We always have.": 1, "We will keep each other safe. No matter what.": 1, "We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.": 1, "We will honor and sing praises for the fallen.": 1, "We will have that Stalhrim, and there's nothing you can do to stop us!": 1, "We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care.": 1, "We will endure. We always have.": 1, "We will be back. This is not over.": 1, "We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.": 1, "We were two of the city's oldest an' most-respected clans, an' we could trace our histories all the way back to Ysgramor's companions.": 1, "We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine.": 1, "We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for.": 1, "We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.": 1, "We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold.": 1, "We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.": 1, "We were once a wealthy and prosperous society that occupied a portion of Skyrim.": 1, "We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.": 1, "We were hoping Isran would be of help. That now seems unlikely.": 1, "We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim.": 1, "We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran.": 1, "We were digging in these mines when she found us.": 1, "We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.": 1, "We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there.": 1, "We should talk again sometime.": 1, "We should strike them first before they can muster a larger force.": 1, "We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.": 1, "We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.": 1, "We own Cidhna Mine. Best prison in Skyrim, and source of half the wealth in this city.": 1, "We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces.": 1, "We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this.": 1, "We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!": 1, "We now have Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer with action!": 1, "We no longer use that name for them. They have reclaimed their identity and no longer represent the patronage of the false Tribunal.": 1, "We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.": 1, "We never should have brought that thing here...": 1, "We never should have brought that thing here!": 1, "We never saw him again.": 1, "We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house.": 1, "We need to strike a crippling blow against them before they muster more men against us.": 1, "We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception.": 1, "We need to stop this creature before it kills again.": 1, "We need to move. Now!": 1, "We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.": 1, "We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!": 1, "We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever troops he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.": 1, "We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.": 1, "We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole keep!": 1, "We need to get inside. Follow me!": 1, "We need to get in there and stop this!": 1, "We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.": 1, "We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.": 1, "We need to find out what Ancano's up to.": 1, "We need to find my mother, Valerica. ": 1, "We need to find enough control cubes to keep the pumps running and to turn on all four boilers.": 1, "We need to find a way out of here.": 1, "We need to put a damper on their efforts and give those trouble makers something to worry about other than harassing our interests.": 1, "We ran out of jazbay berries almost two weeks ago.": 1, "We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves.": 1, "We read these ancient scrolls of prophecy in order to divine the future, and we use that knowledge to aid the Emperor.": 1, "We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Thorryg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.": 1, "We should really get to court.": 1, "We should present the verse soon.": 1, "We should not...": 1, "We should not be talking about that.": 1, "We should keep moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.": 1, "We should keep it small. Too many people, and we'll draw unwanted attention to ourselves.": 1, "We should have the festival soon.": 1, "We should go over our strategy again in case the Stormcloaks attack.": 1, "We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.": 1, "We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.": 1, "We should check these rooms for supplies before heading further into the temple.": 1, "We should check these rooms for supplies before going any further.": 1, "We should be inside, loading up on treasure. Worry-scales here thinks we should wait, though. Don't get any ideas, either. We were here first.": 1, "We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor.": 1, "We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.": 1, "We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?": 1, "We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?": 1, "We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.": 1, "We rejoice as the New Temple rises. We rejoice because we embrace the Reclamations as our saviors.": 1, "We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.": 1, "We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.": 1, "We respect the old ways, the Nord ways, an' a Gray-Mane has worked the Skyforge since before the time of my grandfather's father.": 1, "We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn.": 1, "We sail as soon as I'm paid.": 1, "We sell bows, arrows and ale. A unique combination, to be sure.": 1, "We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?": 1, "We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.": 1, "We shall clear the way for the coming of the true Dragonborn!": 1, "We shall safeguard it... for now.": 1, "We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!": 1, "We seek to live in peace with the land, but he had an eye for dominance and strength.": 1, "We're so grateful for your help.": 1, "We would but there's a big wedding taking place at Castle Dour. We'll have to wait until after the wedding. ": 1, "We'd be honored to have you join us.": 1, "We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves. ": 1, "We're here to teach you a lesson.": 1, "We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?": 1, "We're headed to Korvanjund. But, if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into trouble of some kind.": 1, "We're going to rebuild. The hall, and ourselves. In some form or another.": 1, "We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.": 1, "We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it.": 1, "We're going to install a garrison there, but first, your going to clean out the bandits that have moved in.": 1, "We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.": 1, "We're going to be making this back fifty-fold, partner. Trust me on this.": 1, "We're going to a place I've never been... and we're goind to see my mother. After all these years.": 1, "We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.": 1, "We're getting out of here. Now.": 1, "We're getting close. I'm sure of it.": 1, "We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.": 1, "We're getting back to work as best we can.": 1, "We're finally going to arrest the Butcher.": 1, "We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though.": 1, "We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time.": 1, "We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves.": 1, "We're done with this when none of them are left standing. Let's go.": 1, "We're done then? Good.": 1, "We're done here, I think.": 1, "We're colder than the snow and harder than steel. We wrap ourselves in both to remind us of the world we face.": 1, "We're close now. I can see the camp.": 1, "We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.": 1, "We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.": 1, "We're backing Erikur. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.": 1, "We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.": 1, "We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?": 1, "We're getting Thorald back, no matter what.": 1, "We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?": 1, "We're in this together. Stay close.": 1, "We're just lucky I was here to return the Chalice to Vingalmo, so he could make sure Harkon gets it back.": 1, "We're safe he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face.": 1, "We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more.": 1, "We're ready. ": 1, "We're ready, Dragonborn, our wrath to unleash.": 1, "We're quartered in the Hall of the Vigilant. Keeper Carcette heads Skyrim's branch of our order there, providing healing and justice as needed.": 1, "We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city.": 1, "We're playing Hunt the Elf. You're the Elf.": 1, "We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.": 1, "We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit.": 1, "We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.": 1, "We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you.": 1, "We're not looking for sellswords. The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it.": 1, "We're not leaving until we get what we came for.": 1, "We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.": 1, "We're just going to need some help.": 1, "We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde.": 1, "We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.": 1, "We're not going to make it, are we?": 1, "We're not going to have a problem with your little... project, are we?": 1, "We're not going to be lounging around in a hall anymore, so you'll have to be a little more useful. Can't make mead down here.": 1, "We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there.": 1, "We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.": 1, "We're nearly out of coal again.": 1, "We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.": 1, "We're making sure your Emperor wasn't lying to his elven masters when he agreed the Empire would give up false gods and foolish beliefs. ": 1, "We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps...": 1, "We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.": 1, "We're looking for some Vampires that have been reported in the area. Seen any?": 1, "We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.": 1, "We're just out here temporarily, to regroup.": 1, "We're not kicking you out, just keep the sermons at the temple and let us all sin in peace.": 1, "We're also going to need a sample of her blood. Which... if we could get that, we wouldn't even be trying to do this in the first place.": 1, "We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!": 1, "We're all trying to become better mages, right?": 1, "We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.": 1, "We'll let it seem like it's his idea.": 1, "We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.": 1, "We'll have to sweeten the pot a bit, this time. I think I'll need... say, two thousand septims to hire replacements.": 1, "We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me.": 1, "We'll have to carry this one on our backs....": 1, "We'll have our freedom. One day.": 1, "We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space.": 1, "We'll get to that.": 1, "We'll get by.": 1, "We'll finally be able to begin repairs on The Bulwark. Thank you.": 1, "We'll figure something out. And I'll get better, I promise.": 1, "We'll cross to the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove.": 1, "We'll cross once it's safe.": 1, "We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful.": 1, "We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.": 1, "We'll chat after the ceremony.": 1, "We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we. ": 1, "We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.": 1, "We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.": 1, "We'll all meet Arkay sooner or later. Best to enjoy the time we've got.": 1, "We'd better push on. The rest of them will have to find another way out.": 1, "We'd better push on. I'm sure the others will find another way out.": 1, "We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.": 1, "We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.": 1, "We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.": 1, "We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.": 1, "We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.": 1, "We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.": 1, "We'd best be careful in here.": 1, "We'll clean up here. You go with Bujold.": 1, "We'll make it through, dear. We always do.": 1, "We'll make it, Greta. We always have so far...": 1, "We'll make sure there's nothing left of them.": 1, "We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!": 1, "We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?": 1, "We're all in agreement that you're entitled to as much as you can carry.": 1, "We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately. ": 1, "We're all doomed.": 1, "We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.": 1, "We're all behind you, friend. Do your best.": 1, "We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own.": 1, "We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it.": 1, "We'll talk more when we're there.": 1, "We'll talk another time, perhaps.": 1, "We'll stop these monsters. We have to; we're the only ones who can.": 1, "We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.": 1, "We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.": 1, "We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.": 1, "We'll speak when the Oath is complete.": 1, "We'll speak again soon.": 1, "We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother.": 1, "We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!": 1, "We'll meet up near Karthspire.": 1, "We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.": 1, "We'll need to get all three of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control.": 1, "We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.": 1, "We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days.": 1, "We'll need to watch our steps inside.": 1, "We'll pay whatever it takes. But we must have more swords for the Imperial soldiers.": 1, "We'll pull through, I promise. Councilor Morvayn would never let us down.": 1, "We'll secure the castle. You just get to their master!": 1, "We'll see. If the power levels aren't too high you may have it.": 1, "We'll soon find out.": 1, "We'll speak again later. If we must...": 1, "We'll need trained, disciplined and creative warriors ready for all that.": 1, "Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.": 1, "Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.": 1, "Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.": 1, "This was worth coming back for.": 1, "This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful.": 1, "This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door.": 1, "This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...": 1, "This was not the intention, to be sure. It is true that J'zargo was slightly concerned there may have been... problems.": 1, "This was my mother's garden. It... do you know how beautiful something can be when it's tended by a master for hundreds of years?": 1, "This was just the end of something else.": 1, "This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare.": 1, "This was a foolish mistake, outsider.": 1, "This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.": 1, "This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.": 1, "This war of yours makes it difficult for a resourceful woman to advance her interests.": 1, "This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.": 1, "This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.": 1, "This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!": 1, "This war has created so many orphans, and so few are willing to open their hearts to them...": 1, "This vampire showed up while you were away.": 1, "This used to lead into the castle's great hall. It looks like my father had it sealed up.": 1, "This town bores me. How much longer must we stay in this wretched place?": 1, "This tomb is remarkably well-preserved. Fortune has truly smiled on us.": 1, "This tomb is a discovery of great significance. We'll be remembered for this.": 1, "This time, to the death!": 1, "This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards.": 1, "This time let's try \"The Age of Oppression\". I will demonstrate for the class.": 1, "This time let's try \"The Age of Aggression\". I will demonstrate for the class.": 1, "This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.": 1, "This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all.": 1, "This structure is known as a wayshrine. They were used for meditation and for transport when the Chantry was a place of enlightenment.": 1, "This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone.": 1, "This stranger may call himself vampire, but he knows nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to him?": 1, "This visitor has single-handedly dealt with a threat that could have ended your life.": 1, "This stranger may call herself vampire, but she knows nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to her?": 1, "This way everyone! Over here!": 1, "This way! Come on!": 1, "Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands.": 1, "This... this is... an outrage...": 1, "This... this is some dark magic. It has to be.": 1, "This... this is my brother's handwriting. This was his.": 1, "This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it.": 1, "This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing.": 1, "This... isn't over...": 1, "This... This is really from her, isn't it?": 1, "This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar.": 1, "This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.": 1, "This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!": 1, "This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!": 1, "This writing refers to a guardian who inspired both men and dragons.": 1, "This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere.": 1, "This way!": 1, "This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused.": 1, "This won't stop your soul from getting ripped out, but at least you'll look good when your corpse hits the ground.": 1, "This won't end well for you!": 1, "This won't be easy. But we can handle it.": 1, "This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?": 1, "This will only take me a moment...": 1, "This will be worth it.": 1, "This will all be over soon!": 1, "This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akaviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall.": 1, "This what you want? Huh?": 1, "This what you want?": 1, "This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.": 1, "This weather is incredible.": 1, "This way, please.": 1, "This way, friend! Move!": 1, "This won't take long.": 1, "This stranger aligns himself with those that would hunt you down and slay you like an animal, yet I should entrust you to him?": 1, "This stranger aligns herself with those that would hunt you down and slay you like an animal, yet I should entrust you to her?": 1, "This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.": 1, "This one thinks you should be more careful with your spells.": 1, "This one suggests donning some apparel.": 1, "This one is honored by your friendship. I hope this gift does honor to you.": 1, "This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me.": 1, "This new armor fits me like a glove.": 1, "This must be the place.": 1, "This must be that beautiful Skyrim weather I've always heard about.": 1, "This must be it. Let us move quickly.": 1, "This must be him, then.": 1, "This must be her, then.": 1, "This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.": 1, "This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century.": 1, "This metal will serve the forge well, my brother.": 1, "This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help.": 1, "This one wonders - do you have no clothes, or just like the feel of the wind?": 1, "This meant that we were vulnerable to the forces of Oblivion.": 1, "This may be the last time we're able to converse. If you have any questions before you leave, I suggest you ask them.": 1, "This may be the frontier, but we've still got rules. Break them and you'll wind up in the prisons.": 1, "This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before.": 1, "This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?": 1, "This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?": 1, "This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple.": 1, "This looks promising.": 1, "This looks like the way.": 1, "This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.": 1, "This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...": 1, "This looks like some sort of lever puzzle.  We'll have to figure out the correct order to flip them.": 1, "This load cost me double what we had agreed on. Nothing I can do about it.": 1, "This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.": 1, "This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.": 1, "This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?": 1, "This one wonders why you brandish your weapon so?": 1, "This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm?": 1, "This one's claws are ready for you should you assault me again.": 1, "This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes.": 1, "This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?": 1, "This simply takes the right ingredients, the right tools and a lot of patience.": 1, "This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety.": 1, "This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.": 1, "This shouldn't take long.": 1, "This should work. I've done it before.": 1, "This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.": 1, "This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or...": 1, "This should be fun!": 1, "This realm is beyond you. You have no power here.": 1, "This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.": 1, "This projection should be lit up like the night sky...": 1, "This place was quite a find!": 1, "This place was a remarkable find!": 1, "This place reeks of gray-skin filth!": 1, "This place makes me a little uneasy.": 1, "This one's locked. Let's see about that gate.": 1, "This one's mine!": 1, "This one's mine.": 1, "This opens up entire new realms of research for us. Oh, if only Septimus were here to see this!": 1, "This place has had you shaking in your armor ever since we arrived.": 1, "This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault.": 1, "Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal.": 1, "This place is all I'd hoped, and much more.": 1, "This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight.": 1, "This place is getting worse and worse.": 1, "This place is huge.": 1, "This place is sure to make us rich!": 1, "This place is unbelievable.": 1, "This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.": 1, "This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.": 1, "This leads out to the courtyard. Just head for the door.": 1, "Thongvor, I have the latest reports from Cidhna Mine and the smelter. We should go over them immediately.": 1, "Thongvor. I should have executed your whole treacherous clan when I had the chance.": 1, "Tilisu is wife to the family patriarch, Vendil. They have a single child, a daughter named Mirri.": 1, "Tika twafaara filik.": 1, "Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.": 1, "Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.": 1, "Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.": 1, "Thurri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!": 1, "Thu'umii los nahlot": 1, "Thu'um se Dovahkiin inhus, Miraak. Hin suleyksejun oblaan.": 1, "Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users.": 1, "Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.": 1, "Through the inn! Now!": 1, "Through the grace of Auri-El, they were restored to their spectral form to enable them to continue their duties.": 1, "Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone.": 1, "Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas - Korvanjund.": 1, "Tilisu? Are you sure?": 1, "Through some divinations, I believe I've located one. If you retrieve it, I'll give you a staff of my own making.": 1, "Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty.": 1, "Through here. Let's go!": 1, "Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art.": 1, "Three's a crowd. Get rid of your other friend, and I'm yours.": 1, "Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!": 1, "Three taproots soaked in the headwaters of the Harstrad river.": 1, "Three pillars surrounding a central one. Perhaps they are connected somehow?": 1, "Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place to start.": 1, "Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.": 1, "Three guards run into a bar, but the fourth one just ducks. Why?": 1, "Threaten me all you like, it won't matter.": 1, "Thought you'd never ask.": 1, "Thought you could hide, eh?": 1, "Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there.": 1, "Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh. ": 1, "Thought I'd come here to be safe. Now they won't so much as let us in.": 1, "Time for you to die!": 1, "Time is almost irrelevant to the Ideal Masters.": 1, "To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city.": 1, "To Oblivion with your loot! This ends now!": 1, "To Oblivion with you then!": 1, "To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!": 1, "To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!": 1, "To Nchardak, then. Follow me.": 1, "To Hrothmund's Barrow! I need to get his blessing again before we take up residence here.": 1, "Tiri fuklik taaar aburak.": 1, "Tired of running? I knew you were weak. Now pay me.": 1, "Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs! ": 1, "Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!": 1, "Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.": 1, "Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn.": 1, "Time... to end this!": 1, "Time has very little meaning to me. Consequently, it has little meaning to the Ideal Masters as well.": 1, "Time's wasting and Mercer's still out there. Let's get this show on the road.": 1, "Time's my enemy... it's caught up with me before I could find the answers that I'm looking for.": 1, "Time was I could barely hold my own in the Companions. Now I could slaughter them all without a second thought.": 1, "Time to... finish this!": 1, "Time to teach this whelp a lesson!": 1, "Time to prepare some more records on the silver trade.": 1, "Time to meet your maker!": 1, "Time to go.": 1, "Time to gather some bark. ": 1, "Time to find another job.": 1, "Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red.": 1, "Time to fight!": 1, "Time to earn your pay!": 1, "Time to die, outlander!": 1, "Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.": 1, "Time's up! Better luck next time.": 1, "Thought I told you to run for it! Go!": 1, "Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect.": 1, "Though, admittedly... it helps.": 1, "Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.": 1, "Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.": 1, "Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!": 1, "Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.": 1, "Those cowards left decades ago. Every single damned one of them.": 1, "Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?": 1, "Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.": 1, "Those boots'll look mighty fine on me.": 1, "Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers.": 1, "Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one.": 1, "Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.": 1, "Those bastards.": 1, "Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric.": 1, "Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?": 1, "Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools. ": 1, "Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together.": 1, "Those East Empire people should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning Raven Rock.": 1, "Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.": 1, "Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!": 1, "Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?": 1, "Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.": 1, "Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold.": 1, "Thorald? Thorald!": 1, "Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?": 1, "Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.": 1, "Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly.": 1, "Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it.": 1, "Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.": 1, "Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared.": 1, "Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me.": 1, "Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.": 1, "Those filthy vermin... they came in numbers. Waves of the things.": 1, "Those flames get out of control, and you're gonna wish they hadn't.": 1, "Those foul vermin... the abominations we call ash spawn have risen from the ashes of our own ancestors.": 1, "Though they are a rebellious and determined lot. While you've severed the snake's head, the body will likely writhe a while longer.": 1, "Though there's plenty more where he came from. Be ever watchful.": 1, "Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back.": 1, "Though our spirits may be low, and danger lurks beyond the light, I am confident that They will never abandon us again.": 1, "Though I confess, being surrounded by so many wealthy and important people makes me feel more than a little nervous.": 1, "Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.": 1, "Those words have such power!": 1, "Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves. ": 1, "Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer.": 1, "Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?": 1, "Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned.": 1, "Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.": 1, "Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.": 1, "Those vampires put up a hell of a fight.": 1, "Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.": 1, "Those twisted creatures you call Falmer, I call the Betrayed.": 1, "Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts.": 1, "Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.": 1, "Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.": 1, "Those kids are dead anyway. Killing me won't bring them back. I, on the other hand, have done quite a bit with my time on Mundus.": 1, "Those last ones helped me immensely. If you could collect this one for me, it's sure to result in extraordinary success!": 1, "Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil.": 1, "Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.": 1, "Thongvor, do you really think that's wise? I mean, King Ulfric is such a busy man, and there are so many areas of Skyrim to protect.": 1, "Those of us that didn't die were made prisoners.": 1, "Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel.": 1, "Those soldiers weren't worth much. ": 1, "Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines.": 1, "Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?": 1, "Those thieves must be mad, hiding out there. Those old crypts are filled with nothing but traps, trolls, and who knows what else!": 1, "Those things had filled it up with slop for their beasts. Elmus helped me wash it out, but the fire still smells terrible.": 1, "Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.": 1, "To Whiterun with you.": 1, "This latest attack proves it's the right time.": 1, "This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged.": 1, "This is a decent spot. We're right on the water. This could grow into something respectable.": 1, "This is a dangerous thing, then. We should return to my village, and show this to my father.": 1, "This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.": 1, "This is a Telvanni tower. It's my citadel, grown from the spores of the giant fungus trees found in Morrowind.": 1, "This is Thalmor business, now get out of here!": 1, "This is Thalmor business and no concern of yours.": 1, "This is Stormcloak territory. If you're one of those craven Imperials, don't expect a warm welcome.": 1, "This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.": 1, "This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.": 1, "This is Master Neloth's tower. He's a Telvanni Wizard.": 1, "This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. The innkeeper ought to be able to tell us if there's any dragon mound nearby.": 1, "This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. Let's see if we can find that dragon mound.": 1, "This is House Redoran territory. You'd do well to remember that.": 1, "This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here.": 1, "This is a dwarven artifact beyond nearly all value. A singular instrument of immense power, a tool of impossible import.": 1, "This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.": 1, "This is Dusty. I personally trained her from a larva. Feels like a lifetime ago now.": 1, "This is Apocrypha, where all knowledge is hoarded.": 1, "This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?": 1, "This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor.": 1, "This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day.": 1, "This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.": 1, "This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!": 1, "This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?": 1, "This has ruined my entire day.": 1, "This has gone on long enough.": 1, "This has certainly been quite the adventure, hasn't it?": 1, "This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. I need help.": 1, "This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts.": 1, "This had better be important. ": 1, "This is Fort Dawnguard.": 1, "This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.": 1, "This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!": 1, "This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore.": 1, "This is clearly in the same tradition as the draugr tombs of Skyrim.": 1, "This is clearly a tomb, if a rather elaborate one. I would guess it was built for a Dragon Priest who achieved great fame in his time.": 1, "This is by his hand, for certain.": 1, "This is both fascinating and terrifying.": 1, "This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?": 1, "This is an utter waste of time.": 1, "This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded.": 1, "This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here.": 1, "This is an ode to Skyrim's truest sons and daughters... the Stormcloaks.": 1, "This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.": 1, "This is an intriguing change.": 1, "This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used...": 1, "This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.": 1, "This is all your fault, you know.": 1, "This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget.": 1, "This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?": 1, "This is all too much for me.": 1, "This is all more excitement than I'm used to.": 1, "This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think...": 1, "This is all I can offer in return for this. I hope it's enough.": 1, "This is a waste of time.": 1, "This is a statue of Auriel, but it's using the older signs of his power. This temple must be ancient.": 1, "This is a serious accusation. I'm sure Bujold can straighten it out for us. ": 1, "This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy.": 1, "This is a proper store. Start acting like a proper customer. Sheathe that weapon.": 1, "This is a private home, and the master of the house is a very old man. He's not to be disturbed.": 1, "This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late.": 1, "This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?": 1, "This is a magic duel. Ma-gic. You know, with spells.": 1, "This is a little creepy.": 1, "This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.": 1, "This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!": 1, "This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once.": 1, "This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.": 1, "This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them.": 1, "This \"stranger\" has done more for me in the brief time I've known him than you've done in centuries!": 1, "This \"stranger\" has done more for me in the brief time I've known her than you've done in centuries!": 1, "Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process.": 1, "Thirsk was respectable. And we let this happen. No, we'll get respect the way it should come.": 1, "Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say \"yes.\"": 1, "Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.": 1, "Thinking I need to train some more.": 1, "Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value.": 1, "Think you can take me?": 1, "Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.": 1, "Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.": 1, "Think we should buy more horses next season?": 1, "Think very carefully about your next move...": 1, "This Dark Elves of Raven Rock keep to their city, and we Skaal keep to our village.": 1, "Think the guards will be coming down, soon?": 1, "Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?": 1, "Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.": 1, "Think of him? He's an odd little man. Always poking around the ruins and wasting time in his museum.": 1, "Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.": 1, "Think nothing of it.": 1, "Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?": 1, "Think he worked down at the smelter. Lot of the laborers there are sympathetic to the Forsworn.": 1, "Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.": 1, "Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.": 1, "Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?": 1, "Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.": 1, "Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck.": 1, "Think I'm defenseless? Well you're wrong!": 1, "Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see.": 1, "Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend.": 1, "This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, then... yes, yes, it could work.": 1, "This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.": 1, "This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it \"aptitude,\" for elimination.": 1, "This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.": 1, "This gathering is nothing more than a boast. The Thalmor are reminding us that we're at their beck and call.": 1, "This fire seems significant. I'm sure it's important for some reason.": 1, "This feels like the right way. I was starting to worry.": 1, "This far? We're livin' in a sewer. You said we'd have a house as big as the Black-Briars' by now.": 1, "This ends now!": 1, "This drink's on me.": 1, "This dragon's soul belongs to me.": 1, "This doesn't concern you, \"citizen.\" ": 1, "This day was always coming!": 1, "This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.": 1, "This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.": 1, "This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous.": 1, "This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.": 1, "This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!": 1, "This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions.": 1, "This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.": 1, "This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up.": 1, "This again?! That was different. Was Balgruuf given a chance to object? No. The Jarls weren't asked. He was told. And he had to like it.": 1, "This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No.": 1, "This attack... it's unlike the vampires. Do we at least know what they were after, or is this completely a lost cause?": 1, "This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.": 1, "This better not be all the things you just can't be bothered with.": 1, "This is enough to make your head spin, eh?": 1, "This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf.": 1, "This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources.": 1, "This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.": 1, "This can't be happening!": 1, "This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...": 1, "This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.": 1, "This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate...  let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere...": 1, "This book... It seems wrong, somehow. Here, yet... not. It may be what we seek.": 1, "This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too.": 1, "This is everything I've got right now.": 1, "This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's.": 1, "This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other? ": 1, "This is what it's come to. No one seems to care what they've done to our home.": 1, "This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.": 1, "This is what I've trained for!": 1, "This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach.": 1, "This is what I hired you for!": 1, "This is what I get for skimping on labor.": 1, "This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?": 1, "This is unfair! I'm innocent!": 1, "This is true, but my techniques only work on the living. You've chosen a different path to remake yourself.": 1, "This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you.": 1, "This is the time of the Dawnguard!": 1, "This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years.": 1, "This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.": 1, "This is what your obsession brings you!": 1, "This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.": 1, "This is the power that I offer!": 1, "This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!": 1, "This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.": 1, "This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world. ": 1, "This is the most peace and quiet I've had in a lifetime.": 1, "This is the longest day I can remember.": 1, "This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!": 1, "This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!": 1, "This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again.": 1, "This is the kind of thing I've been wanting to see. ": 1, "This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.": 1, "This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live.": 1, "This is the best news I've ever gotten!": 1, "This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold.": 1, "This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants.": 1, "This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.": 1, "This is where it will begin. A new uprising.": 1, "This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.": 1, "This land feels... twisted. I'm surprised my father didn't want to live out here.": 1, "This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.": 1, "This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.": 1, "This just isn't right. Why was I working on that stone?": 1, "This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks. ": 1, "This isn't that watered down child's power that you simply contract from another vampire. We're pureblood creations of original vampires.": 1, "This isn't really a good time.": 1, "This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed.": 1, "This isn't over, Jorleif! ": 1, "This isn't good. We only got a little ways in when something managed to wake up the draugr.": 1, "This isn't exactly the city of Blacklight. We're on the frontier out here, and we've had more than a fair share of troubles.": 1, "This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please... he'll have me killed!": 1, "This isn't about the money.": 1, "This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business.": 1, "This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore.": 1, "This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.": 1, "This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.": 1, "This isn't Skyrim, outlander. A group of powerful and influential Dunmer families have been ruling Morrowind for millennia.": 1, "This island's nothing but a pile of rubble. What's the point trying to make a life here?": 1, "This island was never meant for us. There's too much death here.": 1, "This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?": 1, "This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.": 1, "This is... he should not have gone alone. ": 1, "This is, or was, the epicenter of our religion. Most of the snow elf people worshipped Auri-El.": 1, "This is your initiation into the coven. Go ahead. Have the first bite.": 1, "This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!": 1, "This is worse than I thought...": 1, "This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is.": 1, "This is why I say we take the fight to them. Gather the Legion and drive those blasted beasts out of the Reach for good.": 1, "This is why I avoid being social.": 1, "This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin.": 1, "This is the Skyrim you want?!": 1, "This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.": 1, "This is the Old Hroldan Inn. Clean beds and strong drink.": 1, "This is more delicate work than you're used to.": 1, "This is lovely, as always, Eola.": 1, "This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.": 1, "This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.": 1, "This is last time we speak of this.": 1, "This is just what I need right now.": 1, "This is just dreadful. Dreadful.": 1, "This is it. We've found Gathrik's tomb.": 1, "This is it. Home sweet... castle.": 1, "This is it.": 1, "This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?": 1, "This is it! Gathrik awaits us!": 1, "This is it!": 1, "This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?": 1, "This is most exciting, wouldn't you agree?": 1, "This is insanity. We never should've come here.": 1, "This is incredible. It's like a whole other world.": 1, "This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust?": 1, "This is how it's done.": 1, "This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.": 1, "This is home, now, boy. Start living it.": 1, "This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again.": 1, "This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?": 1, "This is going to end horribly, I just know it.": 1, "This is going to be terrible for business...": 1, "This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads.": 1, "This is generally performed at the Imperial Library, but as history has shown us, that isn't always possible.": 1, "This is fun.": 1, "This is for Haldyn!": 1, "This is fine for now, but we can't stay holed up here forever.": 1, "This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!": 1, "This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!": 1, "This is my business. My city. You Empire lovers should learn to stay out of it.": 1, "This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend.": 1, "This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.": 1, "This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.": 1, "This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.": 1, "This is strange.": 1, "This is simply fascinating.": 1, "This is ridiculous.": 1, "This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!": 1, "This is preposterous. Disrespect... insulting! I am tired of being hounded from all sides!": 1, "This is pointless.": 1, "This is our only chance.": 1, "This is our fight and this is our fate!": 1, "This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.": 1, "This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.": 1, "This is notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so... we may have to kill a few bandits.": 1, "This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.": 1, "This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.": 1, "This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts.": 1, "This is my hunting ground.": 1, "This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much to let you take it from me!": 1, "This is my realm. I won't let you take it from me!": 1, "This is my savior, the one who freed me.": 1, "This is my treasure!": 1, "This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.": 1, "This is exciting, isn't it?": 1, "This is no time for idle talk.": 1, "This is not J'zargo's fault!": 1, "This is not about your desires, lad.": 1, "This is not about your desires, lass.": 1, "This is not good.": 1, "This is not just a dagger!": 1, "This is not over, I assure you.": 1, "This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn.": 1, "To activate this strange power, one must only speak the magic words, which are...": 1, "To arms!": 1, "To arms, boys! To arms!": 1, "Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed.": 1, "Uncommon Taste. It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight.": 1, "Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed? Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?": 1, "Uncle Calcelmo....": 1, "Uncle Alvor! Hello!": 1, "Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-draggers. It's a wonder they don't still live in a cave like those ancestors they keep boasting about.": 1, "Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.": 1, "Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.": 1, "Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.": 1, "Ummm... they'd lock me up if I went around like that.": 1, "Ummm, Morrowind suffered a massive explosion...": 1, "Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't.": 1, "Umm... you're not planning on using that weapon, are you? At least not on me... right?": 1, "Umm... yeah.": 1, "Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful.": 1, "Umm... what were we talking about?": 1, "Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?": 1, "Umm... are you in trouble? Is that why you're hiding like that?": 1, "Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?": 1, "Umm... Did you want somethin' to eat?": 1, "Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.": 1, "Um...this place looks dangerous.": 1, "Um... yes, of course, sir. ": 1, "Um... yeah...": 1, "Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?": 1, "Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan.": 1, "Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward.": 1, "Um... I was thinking you might like this. Here. It's nothing really.": 1, "Um...": 1, "Um. Yeah.": 1, "Umm... this is the part where we usually get in the boat. You with me?": 1, "Um. Well, he is a very great wizard. It's a great honor for him to have taken me as his apprentice.": 1, "Understandable considering the differences between us.": 1, "Understood... husband?": 1, "Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk.": 1, "Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.": 1, "Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested.": 1, "Unless of course you'd like to contribute to my investigation. It could be very enlightening to observe you.": 1, "Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it.": 1, "Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.": 1, "Unh... who are you?": 1, "Unh... where is... who sent you here?": 1, "Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?": 1, "Unghhh... oww...": 1, "Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords.": 1, "Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped.": 1, "Unfortunately, we were constantly at war with the Nords who claimed the land as their ancestral home.": 1, "Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see.": 1, "Understood, sir.": 1, "Unfortunately, thanks to some problems they've been having, it hasn't seen much use lately.": 1, "Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College.": 1, "Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit.": 1, "Unfortunately, each cube we retrieve shuts down the corresponding pumps, raising the water level. We'll have to be careful.": 1, "Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice.": 1, "Unfortunately, I'd left the other guardsman behind and he never made it. Captain Veleth discharged me from service.": 1, "Unfortunately, Adril and Councilor Morvayn are very close friends, and they will never abandon one another... despite my feelings.": 1, "Unfortunately you don't appear to be suffering from any side effects.": 1, "Unfortunately for you, we don't allow the uninitiated into the inner sanctum. ": 1, "Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men into the inner sanctum.": 1, "Unfortunately for you, my mission here is also a secret. To protect it, I have no choice but to silence you.": 1, "Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.": 1, "Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.": 1, "Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!": 1, "Unearthly screams?": 1, "Unfortunately, sometimes the stone of scholarship is built on the foundation of death. I'll inform the kin.": 1, "Um, thank you. Sir. Was there anything else I can do for you?": 1, "Um, no. Nothing. Nothing at all.": 1, "Um, good. We reward loyalty, you know.": 1, "Uhhh... (coughing, wheezing) ... ahhhh...": 1, "Uhhh.": 1, "Uhh.. thank you...": 1, "Uhh!": 1, "Uh...now it's my turn!": 1, "Uh...Well, sort of.": 1, "Uh... you mean leave Raven Rock? For good? To go work for a crazed Telvanni wizard?": 1, "Uh... yeah. That sounds good. Half. I think that will work.": 1, "Uh... yeah.": 1, "Uh... why don't we talk about this later?": 1, "Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.": 1, "Uh. Hey. That weapon there is just for show. Right? I mean, you aren't going to hurt me or anything... right?": 1, "Uh-oh.": 1, "Uh, yes. Quite.": 1, "Uhhhhh.": 1, "Uh, yes sir. That's me. The oafish servant.": 1, "Uh, sorry.": 1, "Uh, right. Maybe just one of the popular songs, like \"The Slaying of the Falmer Princes\"?": 1, "Uh, oh. You ain't gonna hurt me again, are ya?": 1, "Uh, my weapon? I mostly just use my pa's axe, when wolves are attacking the goats or something.": 1, "Uh, crossbow? I've never...": 1, "Uh, a nail?": 1, "Uh, Brelas, sir. Did you need a drink? Something to eat?": 1, "Uh oh. A fellow bard. I best not miss my notes or forget any lyrics.": 1, "Uh oh! Look out!": 1, "Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli.": 1, "Uh huh.": 1, "Ugor, no! This may be the one we need.": 1, "Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.": 1, "Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.": 1, "Uh, yes ma'am.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.": 1, "Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks.": 1, "Um, I prefer to handle these things on my own.": 1, "Um, I don't know, why?": 1, "Ulves runs the kitchens.": 1, "Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.": 1, "Ulfric... what have you done my old friend?": 1, "Ulfric. Stop.": 1, "Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown.": 1, "Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits.": 1, "Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.": 1, "Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.": 1, "Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it.": 1, "Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.": 1, "Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy. ": 1, "Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess.": 1, "Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.": 1, "Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak! ": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.": 1, "Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero. But a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.": 1, "Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat.": 1, "Unless you can help, leave us in peace.": 1, "Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War.": 1, "Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him.": 1, "Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really.": 1, "Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere.": 1, "Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all.": 1, "Ulfric is the one who has offended. ": 1, "Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories.": 1, "Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.": 1, "Ugh. You mangy piece of pit-bait.": 1, "Unless you have enough coin on you, I'm not going anywhere.": 1, "Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.": 1, "Vampires? Really?": 1, "Vampires?": 1, "Vampires, perhaps?": 1, "Vampires need to be dealt with. Hunted, rooted out, destroyed.": 1, "Vampires enjoy stalking their prey. Passing among us undetected emboldens them. Makes them feel powerful, untouchable.": 1, "Vampires aren't counted among the living. I could probably go through there without a problem.": 1, "Vampires are wretched beings. Feeding off of others the way they do... it's disgusting.": 1, "Vampires are worse than Daedra. I wish we Vigilants had taken them more seriously while we we had the chance.": 1, "Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely.": 1, "Vampire, yes.": 1, "Vampire dust? Seriously?": 1, "Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.": 1, "Vals Veran will die for what he's done.": 1, "Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!": 1, "Varona goes to Raven Rock all the time. I'm sure she's fine.": 1, "Valindor of Riften has his ears in places that we'd love to listening in. Joining our family should increase our possibilities in the south.": 1, "Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?": 1, "Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.": 1, "Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.": 1, "Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.": 1, "Vah...": 1, "Vacation is where the head is. That is what Dervenin told us about our master. He's cozy in his Solitude.": 1, "Uuuuhhhnnnn... aaarrrghhh....": 1, "Uuruuu...": 1, "Uuh. Would you mind dousing that magic?": 1, "Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.": 1, "Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile.": 1, "Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me.": 1, "Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.": 1, "Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago.": 1, "Valin Ulen and his son's remains were both laid to rest there because that's what he'd requested.": 1, "Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.": 1, "Varona was never able to do the repair work that you do.": 1, "Vegetables are the food of the Divines.": 1, "Very good. I'll just... I'll be going now.": 1, "Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.": 1, "Very good. Come, the people await us.": 1, "Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. I have one that you forgot to pick up. I hope you didn't leave any others lying around.": 1, "Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. Assuming you haven't dropped any anywhere.": 1, "Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now.": 1, "Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.": 1, "Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?": 1, "Very good, though I suspect there's more wherever he came from.": 1, "Very good, Thongvor. It relieves me to hear you say that.": 1, "Very good, Galdrus. Your lessons are going well. You may carry on.": 1, "Very good, Aia. Class, observe her finger movements. Let's try a few more pieces.": 1, "Very funny. Did Enthir put you up to this?": 1, "Very funny. ": 1, "Varona, get me some canis root tea.": 1, "Very few people appreciate all the horrible things that can happen to you if you're not being cautious.": 1, "Very clever, mother. Very clever.": 1, "Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.": 1, "Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave.": 1, "Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.": 1, "Vengeance for Laelette!": 1, "Vendil? But he's done so much for Raven Rock... how could this be possible?": 1, "Vendil, Tilisu and Mirri Severin weren't who they appeared to be. I'm afraid they were here to avenge Vilur Ulen's death.": 1, "Vendil Severin. A pleasure to meet you, serjo.": 1, "Ven Mul Riik!": 1, "Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer.": 1, "Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.": 1, "Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health.": 1, "Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise.": 1, "Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!": 1, "Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.": 1, "Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now.": 1, "Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.": 1, "Use the power of the ancient blood to transform into a Vampire Lord.": 1, "Until next time, guardian.": 1, "Until later, then.": 1, "Until he's dead... well, I'm sorry, but we would dishonor our oaths as Blades if we continued to help you.": 1, "Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him.": 1, "Until Ulfric came and put them down.": 1, "Until I met my darling Aphia, yes.": 1, "Untie me. Now.": 1, "Unslaad hokoron! Never again!": 1, "Unslaad Krosis!": 1, "Unnnnhhh...": 1, "Unnnhhhh.... it hurts...": 1, "Unnnhh... ": 1, "Unngh...  Uhhh...": 1, "Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?": 1, "Until next time, then.": 1, "Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please.": 1, "Unlock the door! Hurry!": 1, "Unlock that door and let's get out of here.": 1, "Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go.": 1, "Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests.": 1, "Unlike most of my fellow miners, I was too foolish to save enough coin for that day. The rest I spent on sujamma to drown my sorrows.": 1, "Unlike his son Vilur, Valin was a good man. He contributed to the community and was quite respected.": 1, "Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here.": 1, "Unless...": 1, "Unless, of course, you'd like to make some extra gold.": 1, "Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.": 1, "Unless you're ready to go fight those things, just leave me.": 1, "Unless you're looking for a fight, you'd best walk away.": 1, "Unless you're here to sell that weapon of yours, why don't you put it away.": 1, "Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking.": 1, "Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible.": 1, "Until our next meeting, Skaal-friend, may your hunts always bring you game and your crops grow tall and bountiful.": 1, "Until our next meeting, honored friend.": 1, "Until our next meeting, outsider.": 1, "Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!": 1, "Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.": 1, "Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you.": 1, "Use it right, and you won't feel a thing.": 1, "Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.": 1, "Urog is a good learner. I'm glad I have the chance to teach her. Makes me not miss the woods as much.": 1, "Urog and I still hunt a lot, so it's not like I'm cooped up in the longhouse.": 1, "Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now.": 1, "Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.": 1, "Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.": 1, "Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...": 1, "Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II...": 1, "Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. ": 1, "Up through the tower, let's go!": 1, "Up the stairs! Quickly!": 1, "Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself.": 1, "Unworthy!": 1, "Until the \"Betrayed\" corrupted you. Yes, yes. We've heard this sad story.": 1, "Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again.": 1, "Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive.": 1, "Until then, I've no ale for you.": 1, "Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks.": 1, "Until then, let me offer you a warning. Beware the Forsworn. No place in the Reach is safe from us now.": 1, "Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.": 1, "Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead.": 1, "Until we ended up tracking him to one of the largest bandit encampments I'd ever seen.": 1, "Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.": 1, "Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.": 1, "Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about.": 1, "Until you summon me again.": 1, "Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss.": 1, "Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety. ": 1, "Ugh. What do you want?": 1, "Ugh. The smell here... let's try to handle this quickly.": 1, "Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.": 1, "Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place.": 1, "Too hot-headed, they cried. Weak, pathetic cowards, the lot of them!": 1, "Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.": 1, "Too extreme, they called me. Well, that doesn't seem to have worked out in their favor, now has it?": 1, "Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?": 1, "Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!": 1, "Too bad. That one's my favorite.": 1, "Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.": 1, "Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?": 1, "Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?": 1, "Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree.": 1, "Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?": 1, "Tomorrow. Same time as before.": 1, "Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.": 1, "Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?": 1, "Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?": 1, "Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know.": 1, "Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.": 1, "Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.": 1, "Told you that, did he?": 1, "Tolan, tell him about, what was it, Dimhollow?": 1, "Tolan, tell her about, what was it, Dimhollow?": 1, "Tolan, I don't think that's a good idea.": 1, "Tolan was telling me about some cave that the Vigilants were poking around in. Seemed to think it was related to these recent vampire attacks.": 1, "Token, you say? Let me see.": 1, "Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground.": 1, "Together we form House Telvanni, one of the great houses of Morrowind. The great houses rule what is left of our once proud nation.": 1, "Today, you return the All-Maker!": 1, "Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?": 1, "Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves.": 1, "Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns.": 1, "Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.": 1, "Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own.": 1, "Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles.": 1, "Travel safe.": 1, "Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you.": 1, "Transform into the Vampire Lord, and I will teach you more.": 1, "Traitors. The lot of them.": 1, "Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax.": 1, "Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!": 1, "Tragic, of course. ": 1, "Tradition is very important to me, son.": 1, "Tradition dictates the females be offered to Molag Bal on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal. Those that do emerge as a pure-blooded vampire.": 1, "Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look.": 1, "Track him down and dispose of him. ": 1, "Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.": 1, "Tough day for you!": 1, "Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.": 1, "Too much magic can be dangerous. M'aiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll. ": 1, "Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet. ": 1, "Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!": 1, "Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol.": 1, "Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies. ": 1, "Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day.": 1, "Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth.": 1, "Torolf!": 1, "Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen.": 1, "Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.": 1, "Toor Shul!": 1, "Took your sweet time getting it to me.": 1, "Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.": 1, "Too strong, want be chief.": 1, "Too slow.": 1, "Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.": 1, "Totally unprepared for any real threat. And yet I was the one ridiculed for trying to be ready for anything.": 1, "Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds.": 1, "Today we would consider his techniques rudimentary, but the genius is still evident.": 1, "Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long. ": 1, "To our brethren's aid!": 1, "To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time.": 1, "To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.": 1, "To maintain relationships.": 1, "To know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls.": 1, "To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.": 1, "To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!": 1, "To judge us.": 1, "To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.": 1, "To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight.": 1, "To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees.": 1, "To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.": 1, "To get the answers you seek, you must travel to the top of the mountain and speak to our master, Paarthurnax.": 1, "To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!": 1, "To protect Councilor Morvayn, of course.": 1, "To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.": 1, "To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.": 1, "To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago.": 1, "To come in here alone... a fool like all the rest of them.": 1, "To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?": 1, "To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?": 1, "To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields.": 1, "To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there.": 1, "To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there out there.": 1, "To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics.": 1, "To be honest, it's horrible. He's very unpleasant and hardly teaches me anything. Sometimes he uses me in his experiments.": 1, "To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.": 1, "To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life.": 1, "To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much.": 1, "To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted.": 1, "To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.": 1, "To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance.": 1, "To put it simply, they attacked our settlement and slaughtered almost everyone. It was horrible.": 1, "To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar.": 1, "Today is a good day to die.": 1, "Today I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors, and checked in on all our guests.": 1, "Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it.": 1, "To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.": 1, "To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.": 1, "To what do I owe the honor?": 1, "To understand how we met one another, you have to appreciate what he's going through.": 1, "To touch the sky like a dragon...": 1, "To think... no one's been here in four thousand years...": 1, "To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast.": 1, "To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed.": 1, "To think the Falmer are loosely related to the Dunmer sends shivers down my spine.": 1, "To think that Vendil would stoop so low as to hire those fetchers... I'm glad you killed him.": 1, "To the time after Oblivion opened.": 1, "To the keep! Move!": 1, "To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.": 1, "To the death, then!": 1, "To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world.": 1, "To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot.": 1, "To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit. ": 1, "To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world.": 1, "To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!": 1, "To see the fires!": 1, "Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.": 1, "To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff.": 1, "To tell the truth, Morwen, I thought it would only be a year or two. However, I have come to be very fond of the village and of all of you.": 1, "To tell you the truth, I've been a little distracted. I've got this... idea.": 1, "To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure.": 1, "To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?": 1, "To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord.": 1, "To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.": 1, "To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.": 1, "Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.": 1, "Traveling beyond The Bulwark will be much safer as the result of your victory at Fort Frostmoth. Many thanks.": 1, "Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.": 1, "Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.": 1, "Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War.": 1, "Turns out you don't learn much from just sleeping with something.": 1, "Turns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised.": 1, "Turns out my mother was sneakier than I thought. I wonder what she's hiding?": 1, "Turning someone is a very... personal thing for vampires. It's intimate. For us.": 1, "Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.": 1, "Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.": 1, "Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...": 1, "Turn back...": 1, "Turn around and walk away.": 1, "Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.": 1, "Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.": 1, "Tsk. What a woman will do for a few coins...": 1, "Twenty coins? No one has that much.": 1, "Tsk. What a man will do for a few coins...": 1, "Tsk. And to think, I was going to feed you cabbages and apples again. Yes, little fairy, we can go to the tavern for supper.": 1, "Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.": 1, "Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.": 1, "Try... taking it out?": 1, "Try walking around the grounds with the ring on.": 1, "Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something.": 1, "Try the lower sections of the mine. I've never been able to get that far.": 1, "Try putting yourself back together now.": 1, "Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.": 1, "Try not to?": 1, "Try not to set anything on fire, all right?": 1, "Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?": 1, "Try dripping blood onto the carving on the floor.": 1, "Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!": 1, "Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then.": 1, "Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it.": 1, "Twilight guide your path.": 1, "Twilight watch over you, guardian.": 1, "Ugh. It's talking to me.": 1, "Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me. ": 1, "Ugh. I told you!": 1, "Ugh. I thought this place was supposed to be secret?": 1, "Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!": 1, "Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after.": 1, "Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up.": 1, "Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way.": 1, "Ugh, what a wretched place. Who would build a town in the middle of a swamp?": 1, "Ugh, the stench. We must be nearing a giant's home.": 1, "Ugh, saying it out loud makes it sound so... common. \"Little girl who doesn't get along with her father.\" Read that story a hundred times.": 1, "Ugh, get away from me.": 1, "Ugh, I can't believe I was forced to do manual labor at those shrines. It was horrifying...": 1, "Ugh! The heart stone protects me!": 1, "Ugh! That it? That your best?": 1, "Uf!": 1, "Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake.": 1, "Twisted beasts, a curse of Hircine.

That might work.": 1, "Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.": 1, "Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife.": 1, "Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.": 1, "Try and hit the right target.": 1, "Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead?": 1, "Typical Nord. Beard for brains.": 1, "Typical outlander weakling. But your gold will strengthen our clan.": 1, "Typical.": 1, "Typical. Well don't mind me, then.": 1, "Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception.": 1, "Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship.": 1, "Typical Imperial rot. You speak of Skyrim like you know the land, know its people. You're from Cyrodiil! You know nothing about us! Nothing!": 1, "Things seem to be going well at the Guild.": 1, "Try and hit the middle target.": 1, "Try and hit the far target.": 1, "True story, friend. True story.": 1, "True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius himself.": 1, "True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?": 1, "True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.": 1, "True enough.": 1, "True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose...": 1, "True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day.": 1, "True Nords never back down!": 1, "Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.": 1, "Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.": 1, "Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.": 1, "Trouble is in the air here.": 1, "Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?": 1, "Troll's blood! It's a torture room.": 1, "True, I may look the part of dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare.": 1, "Troll's blood was he a tough one!": 1, "Trifle with us at your peril.": 1, "Tried making some myself, but I'm no good with the forge and anvil.": 1, "Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came \"this\" close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy.": 1, "Tribe-kin stronger. You stay, help more.": 1, "Tribe-kin missing redgrass. Need for godspeak dance.": 1, "Tribe-kin live all places. All of world within great water.": 1, "Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here.": 1, "Treat my people fairly, and I will do the same to you.": 1, "Treasure, you say?": 1, "Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go.": 1, "Tread lightly. The law is unaware of the danger and will treat you as a criminal if you are caught.": 1, "Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.": 1, "Tread carefully.": 1, "Treachery! Attack!": 1, "Trivial in your mind, perhaps. For me, it would mean a great deal.": 1, "True, but I think that Edla would be hurt if you didn't give her the chance to trade for it first.": 1, "True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her...": 1, "True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds.": 1, "Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.": 1, "Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything.": 1, "Try Raven Rock. They are in awe of me there. I'm sure almost anyone would be willing to serve me.": 1, "Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.": 1, "Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.": 1, "Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do.": 1, "Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree.": 1, "Truth is, I'm a little nervous. I've never done anything like this before. I hope you don't mind if I walk up with you.": 1, "Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends. ": 1, "Truth be told, I'd be more comfortable if I were back there. I get nervous in the company of so many worthies.": 1, "Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.": 1, "Trust me. I lived in that castle for a very long time and I know every nook and cranny.": 1, "Trust me.

Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?": 1, "Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city.": 1, "True. But I know a way we can get to the courtyard without arousing suspicion.": 1, "True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.": 1, "True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's. ": 1, "True... But qostiid - prophecy - tells what may be, not what should be.": 1, "True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.": 1, "Truly, one of our great fires has gone out. ": 1, "Try and hit the left target.": 1, "Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.": 1, "Truly? Well done.": 1, "Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!": 1, "Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust in Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?": 1, "Trust is hard to come by here, but all right.": 1, "Trust like that is not freely given.": 1, "Trust me, I've seen my share of hardcases, and she's doing this to herself for no reason.": 1, "Truly? Thank the All-Maker!": 1, "If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead.": 1, "your cunning capture of Numinex, a con for the ages.": 1, "Good. The whole point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.": 1, "For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller.": 1, "For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones.": 1, "For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter.": 1, "For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!": 1, "For unnatural strength, you need look no further than the beasts of this island, mangled by the daedra.": 1, "For two weeks I've tracked that bear, and now find that you've killed it on your own.": 1, "For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill our people! Now, we finally have the means to strike back!": 1, "For those willing to subjugate themselves, he will still bestow the gift, but they must be powerful in their own right before earning his trust.": 1, "For those who cherish memories of loved ones, their compassion often conceals the beast.": 1, "For this, you have my deepest gratitude.": 1, "For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend.": 1, "For this reason, I avoid them when I can.": 1, "For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War.": 1, "For the time being, they will remain open.": 1, "For the time being I will remain here, on the overlook and continue trying to keep the Sanctum free of the Betrayed.": 1, "For the thousands of years I've served as the Chantry's sentinel, there hasn't been a single visitor here for any other reason.": 1, "For the reading? Yeah. Just let the old man know when you're ready.": 1, "For the privilege of entering the city. What does it matter?": 1, "For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture.": 1, "For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with.": 1, "For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do.": 1, "For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!": 1, "For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead.": 1, "For the first time in a long while, I think I - we - may actually be able to do this. And... and I owe it all to you. Thank you.": 1, "For the Night Mother!": 1, "For the Dragonborn!": 1, "For the Dawnguard! For Skyrim!": 1, "Forbidden knowledge was somewhat of a specialty of the dwarves, eh? You don't think they would just leave it alone, do you?": 1, "Foreigners. What a nuisance!": 1, "Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... Well, before... Never mind.": 1, "Forget about Hroggar. He's always so tired lately. I need someone with a little fire in their blood.": 1, "Forgive my surprise, it's just that I wouldn't expect that sort of behavior from someone who isn't Dunmer.": 1, "Forgive my impatience, but I must get back to the village right away.": 1, "Forgive my astonishment, but I never thought I'd witness the death of that dragon.": 1, "Forgive me... Auri-El...": 1, "Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to.": 1, "Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.": 1, "Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.": 1, "Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.": 1, "Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion.": 1, "Forgive me, my instinct was to grant you this title. I am uncertain why. Perhaps one day it will become clear to both of us.": 1, "Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?": 1, "Forgive me, but I am on urgent business for the Dawnguard. Stand aside!": 1, "Forgive me, but I am on urgent business for the Dawnguard. I have no time to speak with you.": 1, "For that price? Sure.": 1, "Forgive me, Qahnaarin. We will continue this when time releases you from its relentless grasp.": 1, "Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this... fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account.": 1, "Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.": 1, "Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.": 1, "Forgive me for worrying about the future of Markarth. The lifeblood of a city is gold, Igmund, and it doesn't stop bleeding because there's a war on.": 1, "Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence.": 1, "Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you.": 1, "Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.": 1, "Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy.": 1, "Forget the old man. I'll come with you.": 1, "Forget the list. She goes to the block.": 1, "Forget the list. He goes to the block.": 1, "Forget it. I'll make things better in my own way.": 1, "Forget it.": 1, "Forgive me, I didn't mean to assume.": 1, "For that amount, I can. Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay.": 1, "For someone called the \"Listener,\" you do an awful lot of shouting...": 1, "For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity.": 1, "For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!": 1, "For all I know, he's already forgotten the conversation. I wouldn't get your hopes up.": 1, "For all I know, I might be the last Imperial left on Solstheim.": 1, "For a stranger, you're not so bad.": 1, "For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?": 1, "For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?": 1, "For a few septims, I'll give you a brief tour that includes some of my most unusual items.": 1, "For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr.": 1, "For Whiterun!": 1, "For Whiterun and Skyrim!": 1, "A letter... not sure who from. He wouldn't say. Just that he was a friend of yours.": 1, "For Vilur Ulen! Long live House Hlaalu!": 1, "For Vilur Ulen!": 1, "For all of this to end, he must die.": 1, "For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years.": 1, "For Miraak!": 1, "For Kynareth!": 1, "For House Telvanni!": 1, "For House Redoran! For honor!": 1, "For House Redoran! For Honor!": 1, "For House Redoran!": 1, "For House Hlaalu!

You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!": 1, "For Sovngarde!": 1, "Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings. Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding.": 1, "For all of us. ": 1, "For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry.": 1, "For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard.": 1, "For shame! You should be locked up for strutting around like that.": 1, "For returning my mother's necklace, you have my gratitude. It means more to me than you can know.": 1, "A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed.": 1, "For one, the landowners of the Reach. It goes without saying that they rely heavily on us for our silver and support.": 1, "For one thing, I won't empty Falkreath's coffers to buy myself fine clothes an' expensive mead.": 1, "For now. My pack lived in the mountains northeast of here, 'till they were wiped out. Damn werebears.": 1, "For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength.": 1, "For now, not much. But in a few decades when I return to Vvardenfell, you would be seen as Morrowind nobility.": 1, "For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.": 1, "For now, give this \"Ratway\" a wide berth.": 1, "For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude.": 1, "For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout.": 1, "For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts.": 1, "For me? I've done what I set out to do.": 1, "For me, a heavy burden. ": 1, "For many years now I have attended to Storn, learning his ways.": 1, "For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined.": 1, "For honor!": 1, "For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do.": 1, "For countless years I've roamed the Soul Cairn, in unintended service to the Ideal Masters.": 1, "For clothes... there's a tailor's shop in Solitude. I'm sure they'd have lots to choose from.": 1, "For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south.": 1, "For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most.": 1, "For centuries I searched for an answer to this problem. I found an old prophecy written by a Moth Priest, those scholars who read the Elder Scrolls.": 1, "For blood! For glory!": 1, "For another, I won't get mixed up with criminals and other sorts who take advantage of the honest folk for profit.": 1, "For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs.": 1, "For me? From whom?": 1, "Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to \"help.\" They won't let anyone work until I sell it off.": 1, "Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up.": 1, "Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse.": 1, "Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!": 1, "Gah! Quit throwing your garbage everywhere.": 1, "Gah! Look over there. I can't believe it.": 1, "Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!": 1, "A joke? Alain Dufont... a joke? I am a king on my throne, and you, my friend... you will die slowly, and painfully.": 1, "Gaaahh...": 1, "Gaaah!": 1, "Gaaaaah!": 1, "G...Gavros? Is that you?": 1, "Fuuughuuuu...": 1, "A kill you must repay.": 1, "Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be very generously rewarded.": 1, "Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be generously rewarded.": 1, "Gah... let's clear out this steam so we can take a look.": 1, "Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.": 1, "Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?": 1, "Funny thing is his stupid Thieves Guild never counted on me and my partner blocking the way.": 1, "Funny coming from a woman who's breath smells like she just kissed a draugr.": 1, "Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi.": 1, "Fruits and vegetables, all ripe and ready for your table!": 1, "Fruit, fresh off the boat! The freshest in Skyrim!": 1, "Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.": 1, "Froo ha cawasy jo la.": 1, "From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy.": 1, "From there, you're on your own. I'm given to understand that they are not difficult to find, if you gather my inference.": 1, "From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother. ": 1, "From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course.": 1, "From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying.": 1, "Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now.": 1, "From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers.": 1, "Gaius Maro still lives. I am surprised. I had assumed you were more... competent.": 1, "Galdrus, it's time for your lesson.": 1, "General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.": 1, "General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.": 1, "General Tullius has his headquarters in Castle Dour, in the city of Solitude, northwest of here.": 1, "General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?": 1, "Gems, potions, exotic ingredients... I have them all!": 1, "Gemma. This town is called \"Kynesgrove.\" That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.": 1, "Gelfek.": 1, "Gelebor and his kind are easily manipulated fools.": 1, "Geldis, I want you to let me know if you see Dreyla with Captain Veleth. I don't trust him.": 1, "Geldis, I need to know if you've heard anything about House Hlaalu setting foot on the island.": 1, "Geldis put you up to this? Another adventurer without a coin to his name? Damnit, I told him not to waste any more of my time.": 1, "Geldis needs to bottle this up and send it to the mainland instead of wasting his time out here... his drinks are outstanding. Thanks.": 1, "Geldis may be a tough boss, but I can put up with it. Keeps a roof over my head.": 1, "Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.": 1, "Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir.": 1, "Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.": 1, "Gave me a lot of time to think, that's for sure.": 1, "Gauldur!": 1, "Gather your things and rest well, my friend. We meet outside Castle Volkihar.": 1, "Gather 'round all!": 1, "Gat and I are the only survivors.": 1, "Garyn, did we make the right decision coming here?": 1, "Gargh!": 1, "Garag!": 1, "Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.": 1, "Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity.": 1, "Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.": 1, "Gallus!": 1, "Gee, thanks for the help.": 1, "Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!": 1, "From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison.": 1, "From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me.": 1, "Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel.": 1, "Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.": 1, "Frabbi, my dear loving wife, could you please clean out our guest rooms?": 1, "Frabbi, a customer needs a drink!": 1, "Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.": 1, "Found the money?": 1, "Found one? Yes, and you read it, too, didn't you? Don't try to deny it, you've got the look. I can see it now.": 1, "Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.": 1, "Found Dusty here in a small cave on Vvardenfell. Silt Strider cocoons are pretty tough.": 1, "Foul blood drinker!": 1, "Fought vampires wherever they found them. I aim to continue that mission.": 1, "Fortune to you and your children.": 1, "Fortune smile upon you, milord!": 1, "Frea saw that the Tree Stone now stands imprisoned in Miraak's new temple. I doubt you can free it until his power is broken.": 1, "Fortune smile upon you, milady!": 1, "Fortunately, you're in a position to breach the barrier that surrounds these ruins.": 1, "Fortunately, you seem to have already killed the Keepers maintaining the barrier around these ruins.": 1, "Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics.": 1, "Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it.": 1, "Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself.": 1, "Fortunately, none. Captain Veleth was able to drive them off almost single-handedly.": 1, "Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.": 1, "Fortunately, I was able to hold them at bay and retreat into these ruins.": 1, "Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact. ": 1, "Fort Frostmoth will never fall! Long live the Empire!": 1, "Forsworn rampaging through the streets. As if business wasn't slow enough.": 1, "Forsworn have troubled the Reach for too long. I intend to deal with them.": 1, "Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards.": 1, "Fortune and glory, friend. Fortune and glory.": 1, "From the castle, you used to just be able to see Solitude over the mountains. It's exactly what I imagined.": 1, "Frea will grieve, but she will prove a good shaman. Storn taught her well. He knew she was ready to guide us in his place.": 1, "Frea! What news do you bring? Is there a way to free our people?": 1, "From that look on your face I'm guessing you've never seen a Silt Strider before?": 1, "From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.": 1, "From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task.": 1, "From her reverie, we know the mind of our god.": 1, "From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine.": 1, "A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood.": 1, "From Winterhold Olaf had sent every message, upon attack he was nowhere in sight.": 1, "From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route.": 1, "A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice.": 1, "From Falkreath to Winterhold, they fell to their knees;": 1, "From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.": 1, "From Adrianne? ": 1, "Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven.": 1, "Frea! I had worried I would not see you again.": 1, "Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.": 1, "Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!": 1, "Frida, you aren't saying....": 1, "Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!": 1, "Fresh fruit and vegetables for sale!": 1, "Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here. Recently.": 1, "Fresh fish! Fresh fish!": 1, "Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar.": 1, "Fresh Fish! Straight from the Fjords!": 1, "Freeing the other Stones will diminish whatever dark influence is spreading across Solstheim.": 1, "Free? No. I have been here too long, Qahnaarin.": 1, "Free of charge for you.": 1, "Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn.": 1, "Frea, my daughter, went to seek out the source of these dark magics. She traveled to the old temple at the center of the island.": 1, "Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.": 1, "Fool. You should have run.": 1, "Fool. I should thank you. I knew the girl wouldn't be strong enough to help me kill Gathrik alone.": 1, "Fool! What do you think you're doing?": 1, "Finally. Someone who recognizes my importance around here.": 1, "Finally. Now get lost.": 1, "Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know.": 1, "A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?": 1, "Finally. I can get back to work.": 1, "Finally, we can reopen the mine and put Shor's Stone back on the map!": 1, "Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way.": 1, "Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.": 1, "Finally, someone comes in. Kick off your boots, stay awhile. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. I got nothing but time these days.": 1, "Finally, someone around here that can get things done. ": 1, "Finally, reinforcements have arrived.": 1, "Finally, my leadership is being recognized.": 1, "Finally, it stopped and began to quiver. A few moments later, the foulest liquid to ever assail your nostrils spewed from its maw.": 1, "Finally. We will not have to listen to his complaining.": 1, "Finally, both of my mines are open again. Time for everyone to get back to work.": 1, "Finally, I can get some sleep at night.": 1, "Finally! Someone who believes me.": 1, "Finally! My prayers have been answered!": 1, "Finally! Let's end this.": 1, "Finally! I never thought I'd see these again.": 1, "Finally!": 1, "Finally came to your senses, eh? Realized what you gave up?": 1, "Filthy natives. Get to work. We have meals to prepare and no time to prepare them!": 1, "Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized.": 1, "Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated.": 1, "Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that.": 1, "Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?": 1, "Figures I'd be woken by a couple of know-nothings. So where are we off to, now?": 1, "Finally, a trace of honesty in our little conversation.": 1, "Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.": 1, "Finally...": 1, "Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.": 1, "Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though.": 1, "Fine! Let it be on your own head then.": 1, "Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.": 1, "Fine weapon, but you wouldn't mind putting it away, I'm sure.": 1, "Fine then.  The blood of my family is on your hands as well as Brurid's.": 1, "Fine by me.": 1, "Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search.": 1, "Find... Paratus... in Oculory...": 1, "Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.": 1, "Find your own thrall. This one's mine.": 1, "A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.": 1, "Find them!": 1, "Find their leader and kill him!": 1, "Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.": 1, "Find the three vessels within Valthume, then return to me. With these we can defeat him.": 1, "Find out why he's here, and what he wants.": 1, "Find out what's happening in the Hall of the Dead. Arkay will watch over you.": 1, "Find my pickaxe yet?": 1, "Find me that stash of wine... I'm itching to be rid of it.": 1, "A little push and this would all be simpler.": 1, "Find anything worthwhile yet?": 1, "Find another way around. Now.": 1, "Find all of them! Don't let any of them get away!": 1, "Find a new steward for us quickly. Master Neloth is making me do all her work.": 1, "Find Sorine and Gunmar, and maybe we can do something about this mess.": 1, "Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!": 1, "Find Lord Harkon. Let him know the time of the prophecy is at hand.": 1, "Find Lord Harkon at once and ask him to please... \"correct\" the situation.": 1, "Find that Moth Priest! I will suffer no delays!": 1, "Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself.": 1, "Figured.": 1, "Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.": 1, "Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.": 1, "Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms.": 1, "Feel free to take a look around the store.": 1, "Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength.": 1, "Feel free to sit and put your head down on the table for as long as you like. I won't bother you.": 1, "Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.": 1, "Feel free to poke around the fort and take what you need. There isn't much yet, but you're welcome to anything you can use.": 1, "Feel free to make requests.": 1, "Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discuss that job I mentioned.": 1, "Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.": 1, "Feel free to ask me anything you like.": 1, "Feeerako.": 1, "Feed well.": 1, "Feel the bite of my axe!": 1, "Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight will diminish along with your powers.": 1, "Feast on life, friend.": 1, "Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth.": 1, "Fear my power!": 1, "Father...": 1, "Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.": 1, "Father, you must not do this. That book is... wrong. Evil. Against everything that you have taught me my whole life.": 1, "Father, why do you and mother fight so much?": 1, "Father, how old were you when you left home?": 1, "Father, how come Olda's so mean to everyone? She's only ever happy when she's with Lodvar, and she's not even married to him! ": 1, "Father, do you want to talk? About mother?": 1, "Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?": 1, "Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul. ": 1, "Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business.": 1, "Feast your eyes on my strange and wondrous collection of curiosities.": 1, "Fighting people is different. Smarter. ": 1, "Feel the last word of Soul Tearing within yourself: \"Zol\" - the unlife that results when a soul is imprisoned in dead flesh.": 1, "Feels good to be mining again.": 1, "Fight well, or die well. Talos be with you!": 1, "A lot of folks around here look to strangers for help. I hope you won't disappoint them.": 1, "Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help.": 1, "Fight well, and I'll make sure your corpse is not dishonored.": 1, "Fight me!": 1, "Fight bravely, friend.": 1, "Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!": 1, "Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.": 1, "Fie!": 1, "Fffffarrrrgah!": 1, "Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse.": 1, "Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust.": 1, "Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts.": 1, "Feel the thunder of my voice!": 1, "Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.": 1, "Fethis, all of us mourn your wife's passing. Just don't let it affect how you treat your daughter.": 1, "Fethis, I'm quite busy at the moment...": 1, "Fethis! How's that pretty young daughter of yours doing?": 1, "Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.": 1, "Feran is so good to me, allowing me to be his assistant.": 1, "Fent ni filok.": 1, "Fenrig! You're alive!": 1, "Fen du hin sille ko Sovngarde!": 1, "Fellow hunter, we're looking for some Vampires that have been reported in the area. Have you seen any?": 1, "A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore.": 1, "Felldir! We agreed not to use it!": 1, "Fell off the top of the cliff after a drunken party with the priestesses of Dibella.": 1, "Felgir paw tuwani barj.": 1, "Fethis, they doesn't care about us. If they did, we wouldn't be standing ankle-deep in ash trying to sell a few meager trinkets to survive.": 1, "General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.": 1, "Fine, I won't fire him, but I'm doing this for your sake. Not his.": 1, "Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage.": 1, "Flattery doesn't suit you, Thongvor.": 1, "A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock.": 1, "Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?": 1, "Fjotra!": 1, "A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years.": 1, "Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?": 1, "Fjola?  How do you know that name?": 1, "Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since.": 1, "Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World.": 1, "Five thousand.": 1, "Fish? Again?": 1, "Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored.": 1, "Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves.": 1, "Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate.": 1, "First, you must open this door.": 1, "A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know.": 1, "A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....": 1, "First, there are ancient references to dragon \"heartscales\". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need.": 1, "A little bit. That's... one of the reasons I wanted to come with you.": 1, "First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business.": 1, "First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul.": 1, "First, I'll need to ask you a few questions.": 1, "First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move.": 1, "First you, then Morvayn!": 1, "First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.": 1, "First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!": 1, "First you die, then Serana suffers!": 1, "First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.": 1, "A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!": 1, "First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin.": 1, "Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god.": 1, "Florentius? Really? I assumed Isran would want nothing to do with him.": 1, "Fool! None may know my secret!": 1, "Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in every doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop!": 1, "Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you?": 1, "Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!": 1, "Fool tribe-kin, chase away. Bilgemuck fear.": 1, "Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim.": 1, "Food, coin, anything you can spare?": 1, "Food's hot. Never said it was good.": 1, "Foo may wa!": 1, "Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers.": 1, "Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?": 1, "Follow your instincts.": 1, "Follow the Captain, prisoner.": 1, "Florentius still worked with the Order from time to time.": 1, "Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.": 1, "Follow me. Let's see where this leads.": 1, "Follow me. I'll take you to it.": 1, "Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.": 1, "Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us. ": 1, "Follow me, this way.": 1, "Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find.": 1, "Follow me and stay close. Keep your eyes open for Durnehviir.": 1, "Follow me and I'll take you to the councilor so you can speak to him yourself.": 1, "Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.": 1, "Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death.  ": 1, "Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...": 1, "Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.": 1, "Focus on the dragon!": 1, "Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.": 1, "Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it.": 1, "First thing is to get this fort back into shape. Right now, a vampire could practically walk right in the front door.": 1, "A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that...": 1, "Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.": 1, "Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you.": 1, "Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.": 1, "Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much.": 1, "Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.": 1, "Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay. Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.": 1, "Fine. Arkay says it's a good idea for me to go. I don't agree, but he's not the sort of fellow you can just ignore.": 1, "Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave.": 1, "Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets. ": 1, "Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second.": 1, "Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.": 1, "Fine, suit yourself.": 1, "Fine, leave me to die.": 1, "Fine. If it will get you to leave me alone. Lead the way.": 1, "Fine, it's your neck.": 1, "Fine, go ahead.": 1, "Fine, fine. This city's not safe, but... that's good. Keeps a kid on edge, alert. Could keep 'em alive when they grow up.": 1, "Fine, fine. Plenty of kids here to play and spar with. Plenty of trades to learn. It's a good place to raise a child.": 1, "Fine, fine. No need to get your breeches in a twist.": 1, "Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now.": 1, "Fine, fine! I can't afford to forget about this work, though. Some very interesting applications.": 1, "Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit about me any more.": 1, "Fine, but we'll be keeping an eye on you.": 1, "Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again.": 1, "Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine.": 1, "Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you.": 1, "Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me.": 1, "Fine, I'll show you, you big bully.": 1, "Fine, here you go.": 1, "First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?": 1, "Fine. If you can't pay with coin, you'll pay with your life!": 1, "Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.": 1, "A little closer.": 1, "A little coin always greases the wheels.": 1, "First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust.": 1, "A little extra protection never hurts.": 1, "First it's ash spawn attacks. Then my home withers. It's almost like someone is out to get me.": 1, "First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life.": 1, "First is the \"Velvet Lechance\" which is a mixture of blackberry, honey, spiced wine and a touch of nightshade... perfectly safe, I assure you.": 1, "First Serana, now you find a Moth Priest. I'm sure Lord Harkon is very pleased with you... for now.": 1, "First I'm going to leave this place, as fast as I can.": 1, "First I'll deal with you, then the soldiers in Raven Rock!": 1, "Fire, storm and ice!": 1, "Fire is not a toy.": 1, "Fire is not a thing to be played with...": 1, "Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.": 1, "Finna? Aeta? Where are my wife and daughter?!": 1, "Finish them!": 1, "Finely done. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my thanks.": 1, "Fine. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?": 1, "Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold.": 1, "Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over.": 1, "Fine. You could've just said 'no'.": 1, "Fine. We do it your way. For now.": 1, "Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...": 1, "Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.": 1, "Fine. Take your books and leave at once.": 1, "Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath.": 1, "Fine. Take it!": 1, "Fine. Please accept this token of gratitude.": 1, "Finished?": 1, "General Tullius, over here!": 1, "General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!": 1, "General.": 1, "Good man. You won't regret it.": 1, "Good man.": 1, "Good luck. Maybe you can figure out what's going on around here.": 1, "Good luck. Mara bless you.": 1, "Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.": 1, "Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude.": 1, "Good luck. I hope you get there in time.": 1, "Good luck. I hope you find the answers you seek.": 1, "Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.": 1, "Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.": 1, "A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.": 1, "Good luck, brother. I'll see you later.": 1, "Good luck, Nightingale.": 1, "Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?": 1, "Good luck, Dragonborn.": 1, "Good luck with that Icewraith.": 1, "Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.": 1, "Good luck out there. Hopefully I'll see you again soon.": 1, "Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.": 1, "Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are.": 1, "Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.": 1, "Good luck finding those jazbay grapes, they're very rare.": 1, "Good lass.": 1, "Good journey, traveler.": 1, "Good journey, my child!": 1, "Good journey, marsh-friend.": 1, "Good journey to you.": 1, "Good job. Take this in return.": 1, "Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.": 1, "Good job. Please accept this in return.": 1, "Good morning, wife.": 1, "Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.": 1, "Good to see you in my museum again. I owe you my life.": 1, "Good to see you again. It's becoming quite lonely out here.": 1, "Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have.": 1, "Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?": 1, "Good to see a new face here. Especially one that isn't attached to an elf.": 1, "Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.": 1, "Good to meet a prospective Bard.": 1, "Good to hear. You can be a difficult woman to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.": 1, "Good to hear. You can be a difficult man to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.": 1, "Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.": 1, "Good to hear! In fact... that's just the spirit I'll need from my second. Do you want to come with me?": 1, "Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger.": 1, "Good to have a customer! You need food or drink, you say the word.": 1, "Good news, Adril. The next shipment from Windhelm should include the building supplies you requested.": 1, "Good to finally be getting some sleep at night. Things are bad enough without everyone around here looking death-eyed, too.": 1, "Good thing the farm's been abandoned for a long time. I'd hate to see what they would do to an unarmed farmer and his family.": 1, "Good thing the boss heard that old farmer running his mouth off in the tavern about finding this place.": 1, "Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.": 1, "Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.": 1, "Good steel's worth every septim. Remember that. ": 1, "Good speaking with you.": 1, "Good riddance.  Let's move on, the scroll must be in the next room.": 1, "Good riddance to bad rubbish I say.": 1, "Good redgrass. Later, we burn. Now, final task.": 1, "Good question. Hard to say. ": 1, "Good point.": 1, "Good people of Solitude.": 1, "Good old Geldis is always managing to keep our spirits up... and our eyesight hazy. Thank you.": 1, "A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad. ": 1, "A good story is nine parts truth and one part fiction.": 1, "Good job.": 1, "Good idea. They might leak out. Don't want them crawling into your head, too. Like me. They're in my head. Right now. Saying things.": 1, "Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!": 1, "Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.": 1, "Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.": 1, "Gods... damn you!": 1, "Gods... Everyone get back!": 1, "Gods. Not this again.": 1, "Gods. Another mouth to feed? You've picked the wrong town to settle, outlander.": 1, "Gods. A woman attacked right on the streets.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Hjaalmarch.": 1, "Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left.": 1, "Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so.": 1, "Gods, what have we done?": 1, "Gods, what a mess.": 1, "Going to cry now? Huh?": 1, "Gods, this is hers, isn't it?": 1, "Gods, it's a wonder it's in one piece!": 1, "Gods, don't let Isran see you like that. Look, I hear Falion in Morthal deals with this kind of thing. Go see him immediately.": 1, "Gods, Vampires! I... I can't take this anymore! I'm not cut out for this!": 1, "Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed.": 1, "Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim.": 1, "Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her.": 1, "Gods' blessings on you.": 1, "Gods strike you down.": 1, "Gods help us, this can't end well.": 1, "Gods guide you, Hadvar.": 1, "Gods be praised.": 1, "Gods above... that's better news than I had hoped!": 1, "Gods above, what are you waiting for?": 1, "Gods, no!": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Eastmarch.": 1, "Going to enjoy killing you!": 1, "Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?": 1, "Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!": 1, "Good hunting. I'll see you back at the Sanctuary.": 1, "Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.": 1, "Good honest work staves off the cold.": 1, "Good friends and neighbors.": 1, "Good for him. For the both of them.": 1, "Good fighting to you.": 1, "Good fight going, here.": 1, "Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.": 1, "Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.": 1, "Good enough. I'll just remove any stolen goods on you, and then you're free to go.": 1, "Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go.": 1, "Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.": 1, "Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power. ": 1, "Good doin' business with ya.": 1, "Good day, friend! Keeping well?": 1, "Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like.": 1, "Good day, Grelka.": 1, "Good day to you. I am Sonir, the bard that your steward has hired. Please let me know if there's anything specific you want to hear.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Haafingar.": 1, "Gonna get cold tonight. Might want to at least cover your delicates.": 1, "Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible.": 1, "Gone now, I suppose.": 1, "Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.": 1, "Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients.": 1, "Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth.": 1, "Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.": 1, "Gold, silver. Gems, maybe? Only one way to find out!": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Falkreath.": 1, "Gods above! Look at that!": 1, "Good to see you, lad! How are things?": 1, "Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire.": 1, "Good. Let's get this over with.": 1, "Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.": 1, "Good. It's done.": 1, "Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more.": 1, "Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it.": 1, "Good. I've been itching for a fight.": 1, "Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.": 1, "Good. I'm glad I can count on you, at least.": 1, "Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...": 1, "Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you.": 1, "Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.": 1, "Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.": 1, "Good. I'll be waiting right here.": 1, "A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do.": 1, "Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants.": 1, "Good. I prefer to nip budding problems before they reach full bloom. I trust it wasn't too much of an effort on your part. ": 1, "Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most.": 1, "Good. I knew I was sending the right woman for the job.": 1, "Good. I knew I was sending the right man for the job.": 1, "Good. I can use the practice.": 1, "Good. I assume you took care of that little infestation. Did you figure out what they were looking for in there?": 1, "Good. Here, take this key.": 1, "Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse.": 1, "Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.": 1, "Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that.": 1, "Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.": 1, "Good. He must be kept safe from harm.": 1, "Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it.": 1, "Good. I suspected you might possess some intellect.": 1, "Good. Go and speak to Garan Marethi. Tell him it is time. He will understand.": 1, "Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.": 1, "Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.": 1, "A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands.": 1, "Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.": 1, "Good. Then there isn't much more to say.": 1, "Good. Then let us see who truly has the soul of the Dov.": 1, "Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.": 1, "If you value your hands, keep them off that.": 1, "Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one.": 1, "Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you.": 1, "Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny.": 1, "A fine question, and the one that I hear most often from visitors to our town.": 1, "Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier.": 1, "Good. That should slow them down.": 1, "Good. Take this token of my gratitude.": 1, "Good. Maybe now they'll afford the vampire threat a tad bit more respect, eh?": 1, "Good. Take this gift. We're even now.": 1, "Good. See that you do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hall to lead.": 1, "Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.": 1, "A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.": 1, "Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.": 1, "Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.": 1, "Good. Now maybe Neloth will get off my back about it.": 1, "Good. Now let me get back to what I was doing.": 1, "Good. Now get going.": 1, "A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King.": 1, "Good. My place is by your side, Thane.": 1, "A gift, Dovahkiin. Shul. Understand Sun as the dov do.": 1, "Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but...": 1, "A gift, Dovahkiin. Toor. Understand Inferno as the dov do.": 1, "Good. Strong instincts and a cunning mind will serve you as well as blade, spell or claw.": 1, "Good to see you, lass! How are things?": 1, "Good. Follow me. We have to fight our way up. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.": 1, "Good. Do not spare them your blade.": 1, "Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that.": 1, "Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done.": 1, "Good, good.": 1, "Good, Illdi. Soak in the lore. Jorn, what happened during the Red Year?": 1, "Good, I could use a pair of extra hands.": 1, "Good, I can use the exercise. Haha!": 1, "Good, I can use all the help I can get.": 1, "Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.": 1, "A good lumberjack is quiet, hard-working, and honest.": 1, "Good! I knew you couldn't have been serious when you dismissed me. Life without music is hardly worth living, is it?": 1, "Good!": 1, "A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College.": 1, "Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.": 1, "Good, good. As soon as I'm done here, I'll try it out.": 1, "Good work. Take this.": 1, "A good point, old friend. ": 1, "Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet.": 1, "Good work. Here's your gold. I have a feeling Nepos gets his own orders, though. If you find out, I'll have more for you.": 1, "Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out.": 1, "Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.": 1, "Good work. A simple job, but it keeps the coin rolling in. Here's your share.": 1, "Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it.": 1, "Good training. ": 1, "Good to talk to you.": 1, "Good to talk to a fellow traveler.": 1, "Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.": 1, "A good question. Partly to keep unwanted intruders away, I suppose.": 1, "Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.": 1, "Good work. It's always best to deal with a problem by ripping it out at the root.": 1, "Good. Don't fail me.": 1, "Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?": 1, "Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that.": 1, "Good. Do not offend me by losing it again.": 1, "A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me.": 1, "Good. Did she say anything we need to know?": 1, "Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.": 1, "Good. Chat time's over.": 1, "Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?": 1, "Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.": 1, "Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hrm?": 1, "Good. And his Writ of Passage?": 1, "Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty.": 1, "Good. Although I do not think he will help you. These secrets are sacred to us.": 1, "Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you.": 1, "Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.": 1, "Good, good. It'll be worth it, I assure you.": 1, "Good, you're here. Look, in Ivarstead, there's this Beautiful Barbarian. I need her dead. Don't ask why. Just do it. This gold should cover it.": 1, "Good, we've wasted enough time here.": 1, "Good, this will help me keep things running without having to worry about a bunch of soldiers falling asleep on duty.": 1, "Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings.": 1, "Good, then you understand why this is about more than just Mercer's lust for power.": 1, "Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier.": 1, "Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?": 1, "Good, now maybe I can get back to work.": 1, "Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble.": 1, "Good, let's get inside there. The sun is starting to get to me.": 1, "Good, good. This time, I'll spring for some more experienced muscle. That should do the trick.": 1, "Good, good. She didn't see you take them?": 1, "Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off.": 1, "Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest.": 1, "Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?": 1, "Father, Captain Veleth and I are in love. He means everything to me. Am I to simply ignore my own heart?": 1, "Go... go right ahead then. Don't let me keep you.": 1, "Go. Reconsider your plight.": 1, "Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away.": 1, "Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.": 1, "Getting tired yet?": 1, "Getting tired of hanging around talking all day. ": 1, "Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you.": 1, "Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place.": 1, "Getting a little antsy...": 1, "Gettin' to old for this.": 1, "Gettin' dull. We'll need a new one soon.": 1, "Get yourself settled, then.": 1, "Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!": 1, "Get yourself cured immediately. You're a threat to all of us otherwise.": 1, "Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.": 1, "Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.": 1, "Get your hand out of my pocket!": 1, "Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.": 1, "Get up, papa! Get up!": 1, "Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!": 1, "Get to the nearest way out!": 1, "Get to the College, before it's too late!": 1, "Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink.": 1, "Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.": 1, "Get those documents to Whiterun.": 1, "Get this gate open.": 1, "Get these things off of me!": 1, "Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!": 1, "Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.": 1, "Get the ingredients in the vessel and let me know when you're ready.": 1, "Get your fresh fruit and produce here!": 1, "Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.": 1, "Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now.": 1, "Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react.": 1, "Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol.": 1, "Given how I've lived... what I've done... I can't ask the gods for a blessing like that.": 1, "Give us a coin, Cosnach. You'll just spend it on cheap ale, anyway.": 1, "Give up?": 1, "Give up! You've already lost.": 1, "Give up while you still can!": 1, "Give up while you can!": 1, "Give those pirates what for! ": 1, "Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.": 1, "Give them their last rites.": 1, "Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.": 1, "Give me... just a moment...": 1, "Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised.": 1, "Gimme a mug of ale.": 1, "Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine.": 1, "Give me just one... little... bite!": 1, "Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we'll need to do.": 1, "Give it your best!": 1, "Give it your best shot!": 1, "Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that.": 1, "Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!": 1, "Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure.": 1, "Give him one more week to think about it.": 1, "Give him a crossbow bolt between the eyes for me!": 1, "Give em the dogs, boys!": 1, "Give Vex a kiss for me.": 1, "Give Mercer my regards when you return to Riften.": 1, "Give Harkon my regards... and a dagger to his heart.": 1, "Give me the book. I will read it, and speak to old Herma-Mora myself. I will make sure he lives up to his part of the bargain.": 1, "Given that, and the considerable power it must have taken to affect our minds so completely, it would suggest the work of a powerful mage.": 1, "Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.": 1, "Get that vile liquid away from me!": 1, "Get it back, for the honor of us all.": 1, "Get in there and push!": 1, "Get in good with them and you'll find her.": 1, "Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk.": 1, "Get him! Rip his throat out!": 1, "Get him out of my sight.": 1, "A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.": 1, "Get going, then.": 1, "Get down there and join Rikke on the front line.": 1, "Get down there and join Galmar on the front line.": 1, "Get back!": 1, "Get back here!": 1, "Get away from me, you filthy woman.": 1, "Get it now while we can!": 1, "Get away from me, you Skyrim trash.": 1, "Get away from me!": 1, "Get away from here, before I get angry.": 1, "Get a move on.": 1, "Get a bad feeling.": 1, "Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken. Pillar of the community. Not prone to flights of fancy...": 1, "Gerdur... ": 1, "Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am.": 1, "Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago.": 1, "Gerdur!": 1, "Genuine Falmerblood Elixir for sale! Live for thousands of years... see into other people's thoughts!": 1, "Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?": 1, "Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace.": 1, "Generally posting information is need to know only.": 1, "Get away from me, outlander.": 1, "Get the coat. Then we'll talk.": 1, "Get it on the ground!": 1, "Get moving!": 1, "Get some Spiced Wine. A Festival Favorite.": 1, "Get rid of this interloper and you and I can be on our way.": 1, "Get ready. Trouble ahead.": 1, "Get ready for a fight.": 1, "Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.": 1, "Get out.": 1, "Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions.": 1, "Get out of our city, gray-skins! This is Nord land!": 1, "Get out of my tower.": 1, "A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries.": 1, "Get out of my head, Daedra!": 1, "Get out of my face.": 1, "Get out of my face!": 1, "Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot.": 1, "Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...": 1, "Get out of here.": 1, "Get out of here, monster.": 1, "Get out of here, before I lose my patience.": 1, "Get out of here!": 1, "Get out of here or I'll call the guards!": 1, "Get out of here before I toss you out.": 1, "Get on your way before I change my mind.": 1, "Get on with it.": 1, "Get off the road, boy!": 1, "Get of my house. Now.": 1, "Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.": 1, "Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.": 1, "Get moving, now. I'll be fine.": 1, "Get out of here. Run to the wilds. ": 1, "Go. Your very presence sickens me.": 1, "Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here.": 1, "Gjalund said our customer in Windhelm wants more of that balm.": 1, "Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.": 1, "Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.": 1, "Go on. Get lost.": 1, "Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi.": 1, "Go on, speak to the children! I'm sure they're eager to meet you.": 1, "Go on, now.": 1, "Go on, leave me alone...": 1, "Go on, get out of here.": 1, "Go on, get moving! I'll try and clear a path for you.": 1, "Go on, Hadvar. Let's hear the rest of it.": 1, "Go on without me. I think I need to be alone for a while.": 1, "Go on now. Time to get your hands bloody.": 1, "Go on inside. Isran'll want to talk to you.": 1, "Go rip that thrice cursed heart stone from her chest.": 1, "Go on downstairs. You're bothering me.": 1, "Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.": 1, "Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.": 1, "Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish.": 1, "Go now, and prove that my faith in you was not misplaced.": 1, "Go now, and carry out this task. This is my command!": 1, "Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.": 1, "Go meet the children and decide who you'd like to adopt.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in the Pale.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in the Reach.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in the Rift.": 1, "A guest, oh my!": 1, "A handful of soul gem shards, some finely-ground bone meal, a good bit of purified void salts...": 1, "A hard truth, that is. Let's drink to the fallen ones.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Winterhold.": 1, "A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker.": 1, "Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.": 1, "Go tell Master Neloth. When I'm done here, I'll prepare her grave.": 1, "Go. Quickly. Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.": 1, "Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land.": 1, "Go. Let us mourn him in our own way.": 1, "Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.": 1, "Go. Find Bilgemuck.": 1, "Go. Do what has to be done.": 1, "Go, then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail.": 1, "Go, then, and do not forget who is your master.": 1, "Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you.": 1, "Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again - afterwards.": 1, "Go, leave me in peace.": 1, "Go, incinerate some poor bastard for me.": 1, "Go, boys! Attack!": 1, "Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you.": 1, "Go, and avenge my Laelette for me.": 1, "Go! Now!": 1, "Go wrong? Go wrong?": 1, "Go with the Light.": 1, "A group of them has holed up in Whiterun.": 1, "Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!": 1, "Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.": 1, "Go to Morthal and find Falion. He's the only one I know of in Skyrim that can cure vampirism.": 1, "Go to Markarth. There you'll find Calcelmo, wise, acid, and reclusive. Help him to emerge and state his intentions.": 1, "Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all.": 1, "Go to Lord Harkon at once, beg him to turn you back. You're dead if you don't.": 1, "Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.": 1, "Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis.": 1, "Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.": 1, "Go! We'll follow when we can!": 1, "Gjalund over at the docks brings me most of my supplies, and the rest comes from bartering with the people in town.": 1, "A healing spell? Are you a priest?": 1, "Go find Lord Harkon. Tell him of your success.": 1, "Glory to the Arch-Mage!": 1, "Glory to Namira!": 1, "Glory only awaits those who triumph. ": 1, "Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.": 1, "Glory in battle, honor in life. ": 1, "Glory awaits!": 1, "Glorious. Serana claims you're her guardian, yet your first instinct appears to be greed. I see that my daughter is still as naive as ever.": 1, "Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise.": 1, "Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs.": 1, "Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs.": 1, "A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you.": 1, "Glad you're finally listening. Come on, let's move.": 1, "Glad you decided to give it a try. I hope Isran likes you.": 1, "Glory to the repulsive!": 1, "Glad you decided to check us out.": 1, "Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.": 1, "Glad to see you finally came to to your senses. Ready to make some coin?": 1, "Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.": 1, "Glad to not be working on that ugly thing anymore. Finally getting some sleep.": 1, "Glad to hear it, Aia.": 1, "Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.": 1, "Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.": 1, "Glad to have a warm place to sleep, myself, but I would have left the rest of these idiots to toughen up a little longer.": 1, "Glad to be back.": 1, "Glad that distraction's over...": 1, "Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.": 1, "Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.": 1, "Gjalund. I was starting to wonder what happened to you.": 1, "Glad to see you've taken care of your little problem, and kept it from becoming my problem.": 1, "Go forth and seek your fortunes. Inhabit the hall as you may. In time, a true leader worthy of the Thirsk name may arise.": 1, "Glover Mallory is a wonder with the hammer and anvil. He mended my armor like an old pro.": 1, "Go ahead and fill her in with all the details.": 1, "Go down already, you bastard!": 1, "Go destroy the feral beast before this becomes a problem.": 1, "Go cull the brutish beasts before the problem gets out of hand.": 1, "Go back to Morrowind, Dark Elf maggots! You're not welcome here!": 1, "Go away... please?": 1, "Go away. Now.": 1, "Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.": 1, "Go away. Go away. Go away!": 1, "Go away! We don't suffer trespassers!": 1, "Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!": 1, "Go away! Leave me alone!": 1, "Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!": 1, "Go and watch the south road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.": 1, "Glover Mallory's the name. If you're looking for a smith, you've found one of the best.": 1, "Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.": 1, "Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.": 1, "Go and do what you must.": 1, "Go and avenge him.": 1, "Go ahead... try to Shout.": 1, "Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me.": 1, "Go ahead. Eat.": 1, "Go ahead. After everything you've done, you should do the honors.": 1, "Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry.": 1, "Go ahead, give it a try.": 1, "Go ahead, Ataf.": 1, "Go ahead and play your little joke.": 1, "Go ahead and play your joke.": 1, "Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.": 1, "Go and speak to him if you like, but do not be surprised if you end up in a wild fox chase. It would not be the first time.": 1, "Father! What have you done!": 1, "Father! No, stop!": 1, "Father! I have returned! There is yet hope!": 1, "Don't talk such rot.": 1, "Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no.": 1, "Don't take too long finding me a steward.": 1, "Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies.": 1, "Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little sickly.": 1, "Don't take offense to the nicknames, morsel. I'm a werewolf. Hard not to think of you as a snack.": 1, "Don't take anything for granted in life. Nothing lasts forever.": 1, "Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.": 1, "Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.": 1, "Don't stop. Keep cutting.": 1, "Don't stay away for too long.": 1, "Don't start swinging that thing in here.": 1, "Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.": 1, "Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!": 1, "Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.": 1, "Don't see that every day.": 1, "Don't see many travelers out this way.": 1, "Don't say words you don't mean.": 1, "Don't say that. It's not your fault, old friend.": 1, "Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him.": 1, "Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.": 1, "Don't say something you'll regret.": 1, "Don't say I didn't warn you.": 1, "Don't sass me, little girl.": 1, "Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim.": 1, "Don't rush ahead. This is a trap if I ever saw one.": 1, "Don't run. Stay for dinner!": 1, "Don't reckon they can use you. But stranger things have happened.": 1, "Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.": 1, "Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it.": 1, "Don't talk to me. You could be one of them.": 1, "Don't tell me you believe that rot! Well, as soon as Jorn gets back, you'll see. You'll see.": 1, "Don't worry about Kuvar. Just be patient, and enjoy the between times, like this one.": 1, "Don't waste your time. Those things are for the weak and foolish.": 1, "Don't waste your time with me.": 1, "Don't waste your life like I did.": 1, "Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!": 1, "Don't want to talk to the likes of you.": 1, "Don't want to talk about it.": 1, "Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.": 1, "Don't want in, huh? Fine. Have a good walk to the next city.": 1, "Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.": 1, "Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.": 1, "Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get.": 1, "Don't try to magic me, you damn wizard.": 1, "Don't tell me - Sibbi and Louis Letrush? Well, Sibbi is in jail and Letrush is certainly welcome to try. My hired help is more than a match for him.": 1, "Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.": 1, "Don't try and impress me. It only leaves you looking foolish.": 1, "Don't trust that one. He's up to something.": 1, "A moment, please.": 1, "Don't touch anything!": 1, "Don't threaten me, boy. You're either a Nord who respects our traditions, or you're not.": 1, "Don't think your false flattery will work on me, Talvas. You're still going to give me that skin sample.": 1, "A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves.": 1, "Don't think that'll keep them from turning on you eventually. They'll figure out what you are.": 1, "Don't think so.": 1, "Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.": 1, "Don't think I don't know what's coming.": 1, "Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle.": 1, "Don't tell me you're that naive. ": 1, "Don't try blocking if you have two weapons. You will only get confused.  Much better to hit twice anyway.": 1, "Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble.": 1, "Don't push, son.": 1, "Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side.": 1, "Don't like it? I hate it!": 1, "Don't let your guard down.": 1, "Don't let those Stormcloaks get away!": 1, "Don't let this innocent-looking flute fool you, for this is the Dancer's Pipe.": 1, "Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule.": 1, "Don't let the state of Raven Rock fool you. Our desire for Raven Rock's return to its former glory is as strong as The Bulwark itself.": 1, "Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.": 1, "Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard.": 1, "Don't let the door slam into your backside on the way out.": 1, "Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.": 1, "Don't let my sister do anything foolish.": 1, "Don't let my posting here fool you. I was once in command of over a hundred troops... my luck simply changed when our homeland was destroyed.": 1, "Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here.": 1, "A more \"serious\" group of the Vigilants of Stendarr. Sometimes when you skin a skeever, you find he has a more aggressive mate.": 1, "Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.": 1, "Don't let me keep you.": 1, "Don't let me catch you spending it at the Netch.": 1, "Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.": 1, "Don't let Viola catch you in her house.": 1, "Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.": 1, "Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge.": 1, "Don't lecture me about treachery, whelp. You don't know the meaning of the word.": 1, "Don't leave, you'd have better dreams here...": 1, "Don't leave poor Melka to die.": 1, "Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though.": 1, "Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.": 1, "Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from.": 1, "Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy.": 1, "Don't let me stand in your way, then.": 1, "Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know.": 1, "Don't listen to him, he's making this up.": 1, "Don't look at me. I didn't kill her. I was just... making sure the body got buried.": 1, "Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here she is. Now what is it that you want?": 1, "Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?": 1, "Don't pity me. And don't look at me like that. I know what I am.": 1, "Don't pay much, but they let me sleep by the fire in the inn most nights.": 1, "Don't pass up on this opportunity, outlander. I'm worth every coin.": 1, "Don't need to pay me no mind. I'm the least important person in here.": 1, "Don't mock it, pup. Even the lowliest beasts can kill the weak and arrogant. We'll try more powerful enemies next, if you survive this.": 1, "Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you.": 1, "Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter.": 1, "Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly.": 1, "Don't miss out... purchase a bottle of my genuine Falmerblood Elixir! Only 20 septims each!": 1, "Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way.": 1, "Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.": 1, "Don't look at me like that. I'm all alone out here, with no one to watch my back.": 1, "Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner.": 1, "Don't mess anything up while you're here...": 1, "Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place.": 1, "Don't mean to be rude, but I'm too busy to talk right now.": 1, "Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to \"walk\" you out.": 1, "Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!": 1, "Don't make me laugh!": 1, "Don't make me choose, father... I beg you!": 1, "Don't make me bring your father into this.": 1, "Don't make a mess of this.": 1, "Don't make a big scene. Don't get caught.": 1, "Don't lose that ring. It was difficult to make.": 1, "A monster? No. I'm just a servant. To my king, Madanach.": 1, "Don't look up. Just focus on me. You can do it!": 1, "Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.": 1, "Don't know what that was, but don't try it again.": 1, "Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money.": 1, "Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.": 1, "Dovahkiin los ok dovahkriid": 1, "Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not?": 1, "Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together.": 1, "Dorthe, listen to me. Your father and your friend may treat you like a boy, but you're not. Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me.": 1, "A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire.": 1, "A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.": 1, "Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?": 1, "Dorthe won't eat that. Are you trying to starve the child?": 1, "Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.": 1, "Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is.": 1, "Door's shut tight. I bet those Resonators would open it, though.": 1, "Door's over there. Why don't you use it?": 1, "Dool.": 1, "Dovahkiin zol mul. Zu'u gahvon miri Alduin.": 1, "Done? Let's get moving.": 1, "Done.": 1, "Done, then? This way!": 1, "Done and done.": 1, "Don't...": 1, "Don't. Get. Caught.": 1, "Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.": 1, "Don't you worry about me. I've been through worse. I'll come out of this just fine.": 1, "Don't you worry about him. I've sent my best men to round him up.": 1, "Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.": 1, "Don't you worry Rhiada. If any Forsworn coming knocking on our door, Nana will let you know....": 1, "A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...": 1, "Don't you think we should focus on finding the rest of the control cubes?": 1, "Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?": 1, "Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble.": 1, "Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?": 1, "Dovahkiin! No!!": 1, "Dovahkiin, hin kah fen kos bonaar.": 1, "Dragons were never gone. They were just invisible and very, very quiet.": 1, "Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.": 1, "Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.": 1, "Dragons breathing fire in the sky. Vampires brazenly attacking people on the street. It's the end of the world I tell you.": 1, "Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life.": 1, "Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons.": 1, "Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now.": 1, "Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?": 1, "Dragonborn? What are you talking about?": 1, "Dragonborn?": 1, "Dragonborn... wait.": 1, "Dragonborn... it's an honor.": 1, "Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be destroyed from the inside.": 1, "Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!": 1, "A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious day.": 1, "Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be immortalized in song. Make it a good kill.": 1, "A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.": 1, "Dragonborn.": 1, "Dragonborn, you have delivered me the gift I requested.": 1, "Dragonborn huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?": 1, "Dragon?": 1, "Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me.": 1, "Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?": 1, "Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans. Embellish if you have to.": 1, "Down here to catch our breath, and then we'll be back in the hall once I get the rest of these up to move.": 1, "Down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs.": 1, "Dovahkiin, you should not have come here. Nu hin sil dii.": 1, "Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal.": 1, "A manifestation of Hermaeus Mora... that book Storn was reading, I've read vague hints of them, but never thought to actually see...": 1, "Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved.": 1, "Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil. ": 1, "Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.": 1, "Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.": 1, "Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman.": 1, "Don't worry, most people can't tell we're related. ": 1, "Don't worry, he's on his way. Just be patient for a minute.": 1, "Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter.": 1, "Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me.": 1, "Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude.": 1, "Don't worry, I'm not in any danger or anything like that. It'll just be more unpleasant to run into my father.": 1, "Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme.": 1, "Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself.": 1, "Don't worry, I'll take careful notes of what happens to you.": 1, "Don't worry, I'll stay right with you.": 1, "Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.": 1, "Don't worry, my love. I'll find a way.": 1, "Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck.": 1, "Don't worry, I think I can help you.": 1, "Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin.": 1, "Don't worry, I am.": 1, "Don't worry, Hewnon will let you pass.": 1, "Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute.": 1, "Don't worry yourself over nothing, Deor. Do you want a head full of gray hairs before you've seen forty winters?": 1, "Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.": 1, "Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.": 1, "Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.": 1, "Don't worry about me. You and Bujold should get up to the barrow.": 1, "Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.": 1, "Don't worry about me.": 1, "A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!": 1, "Don't worry, I think we can make a Dawnguard out of you. Here, take this crossbow and let's see how you shoot.": 1, "Don't you sweet talk me, Alvor. Not after last night. I'll bring you water when I'm done with my other chores.": 1, "Don't worry, my love. Just show the bugs your adoring face, and they'll scurry away in complete fear in no time.": 1, "Don't worry, she's on her way. Just be patient for a minute.": 1, "Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say.": 1, "Don't you see, though? None of that matters. I'm going to go down as \"the Unworthy\" because of that rabble.": 1, "Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.": 1, "Don't you need my help?": 1, "Don't you mean the Anticipations?": 1, "Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing...": 1, "Don't you go trackin' your dirty boots on my clean floor!": 1, "Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.": 1, "Don't you ever wonder, father?": 1, "Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?": 1, "Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!": 1, "Don't you dare. Ever.": 1, "Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?": 1, "Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country.": 1, "Don't you already have someone at home waiting for you?": 1, "Don't you \"dear\" me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!": 1, "Don't worry. We'll take good care of your city when you're gone.": 1, "Don't worry. If you die, I'll find some other way to take care of Ildari.": 1, "Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.": 1, "Don't worry. I'll play my part.": 1, "Don't worry, you can trust Geldis. He's been with us for a long time.": 1, "Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter is resolved.": 1, "Don't worry, we're not monsters. She's fine. We get the money, you get the girl. Everybody wins, right?": 1, "Don't worry, we're not monsters. He's fine. We get the money, you get the guy. Everybody wins, right?": 1, "Don't worry, we'll find the glade.": 1, "Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last.": 1, "Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here.": 1, "Don't worry, the Eight are watching over us. I hope.": 1, "Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king. ": 1, "Dragons, eh? Good, I was looking for a challenge.": 1, "Don't know what that man expects. House is empty.": 1, "Don't know how well I'd have managed by myself. You have my thanks.": 1, "Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.": 1, "Do you not see that we are Thalmor, fool? Begone!": 1, "Do you need anything? Are you hungry?": 1, "Do you need all your toes? I could really use a fresh toe for...nevermind. You aren't moldy enough.": 1, "Do you need alchemy components? Or training?": 1, "Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper.": 1, "Do you miss your days training at the College?": 1, "Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!": 1, "Do you mean by the Earth Stone? There's a shrine there, but I don't remember what it's for...": 1, "Do you like my pretty tower?": 1, "Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent.": 1, "Do you know why I live here, at the peak of the Monahven - what you name Throat of the World?": 1, "Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family, in their grief... and rob them blind.": 1, "Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?": 1, "Do you know where he's staying now?": 1, "Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!": 1, "Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.": 1, "Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?": 1, "Do you know of the Skaal?": 1, "Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.": 1, "Do you know how tired I get of watching the softer ones here grow softer?": 1, "Do you know how many men I've killed?": 1, "Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?": 1, "Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.": 1, "Do you have the gold?": 1, "Do you have the cube? Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can be on our way.": 1, "Do you have the Eldergleam sap?

Are you nothing but a plaything of dez... of fate?": 1, "Do you remember me now, Hjalti?": 1, "Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?": 1, "Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?": 1, "Do you... do you need anything, Feran?": 1, "Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green.": 1, "Do you, now? Hircine doesn't usually bestow his favor on the fickle.": 1, "Do you wish to become a Blade?": 1, "Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?": 1, "Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.": 1, "Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?": 1, "Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?": 1, "Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all.": 1, "Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?": 1, "Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?": 1, "A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.": 1, "Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?": 1, "Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr....": 1, "Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?": 1, "Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.": 1, "Do you think mudcrabs might've taken it? I saw one the other day... Wouldn't be surprised if it followed me here.": 1, "Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work!": 1, "Do you think he's the one we left in the tunnel?": 1, "Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people?

This is the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.": 1, "Do not disturb us.": 1, "Do not disturb us, I beg you. We must focus on Storn's magic.": 1, "Do not distract me.

Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart.": 1, "Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf.": 1, "Do you ever wonder if it hurts? To have one's soul ripped out like that?": 1, "Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?": 1, "Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?": 1, "Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?": 1, "Do you ever get lonely out here in the middle of nowhere?": 1, "Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?": 1, "Do you ever feel lonely?": 1, "Do you bring word from Malacath?": 1, "Do you believe this old hag?": 1, "Do you actually believe any of that?

Works every time.": 1, "Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?": 1, "Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.": 1, "Do you... know what you're doing?": 1, "Do your worst!": 1, "Don't get in my way, and I won't tear your arms off. Simple, isn't it?": 1, "Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?": 1, "Don't get any bright ideas.": 1, "Don't get ahead of yourself. All you are going to do is wear this ring and walk around Tel Mithryn.": 1, "Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit.": 1, "Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you.": 1, "Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.": 1, "Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.": 1, "Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.": 1, "Don't forget to polish those glasses later.": 1, "Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.": 1, "Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.": 1, "Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.": 1, "Don't get involved in that nonsense. Just want to work.": 1, "Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.": 1, "Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it.": 1, "Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.": 1, "Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets.

I hope that dragon stays away from Riverwood. We don't need that kind of trouble.": 1, "Don't even get me started on that lot.": 1, "Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.": 1, "Don't do that.": 1, "Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a \"pretender.\"": 1, "Don't do that again. Last warning.": 1, "Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay.": 1, "Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off.": 1, "A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself.": 1, "Don't know her. Guards dragged that Forsworn's body away, though. Last we'll hear of that.": 1, "Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.": 1, "Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.": 1, "Don't keep waiting, soldier.": 1, "Don't keep our master waiting.

Go get my book!": 1, "Don't just stand there.": 1, "Don't just stand there! Kill that thing!": 1, "Don't just stand there! Come on!": 1, "Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.": 1, "Don't judge this place. We can make home wherever we are.": 1, "Don't get me wrong, he could scam a beggar out of his last septim... but he's no mastermind.": 1, "Don't judge Dengeir too harshly. He is old, but he means well.": 1, "Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains.": 1, "Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger.": 1, "Don't have much to say unless you're here to mine metal.": 1, "Don't have much to say to you. Got work.": 1, "Don't go to the Blue Palace. The master is on vacation. Don't listen to Dervenin. Don't do it.": 1, "Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.": 1, "Don't go talking about that. Only the dinner guests can know.": 1, "Don't go setting the place on fire, okay?": 1, "Don't go near him!": 1, "Don't go casting spells on a woman without asking her permission.": 1, "Don't get yourself killed!": 1, "Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.": 1, "Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out.": 1, "Don't hurt me! You win.": 1, "Do your loyalties lie with the Thalmor, then?": 1, "Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years.": 1, "Don't come near me! I don't want to get hurt again.": 1, "Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no.": 1, "Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.": 1, "Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.": 1, "Doesn't everyone pity the hopeless? Look at me... I'm no better than a beggar.": 1, "Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?": 1, "Does this ice feel a little... thin to you? ": 1, "Does the air feel... heavy down here? I'm a little woozy, but it might just be from waking up.": 1, "Does that mean... is it over? Is Miraak defeated?": 1, "Does that cover everything?": 1, "Does stealing make you feel less impotent?": 1, "Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.": 1, "Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.": 1, "Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.": 1, "Dohaviin, your Voice is no match for mine!": 1, "Does it matter? You're warm, dry... and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?": 1, "Does it involve sneaking and stabbing? Ooh, please say yes!": 1, "Does it bother you to be trespassing right now?": 1, "Does it bother you that I'm here?": 1, "Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?": 1, "Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?": 1, "Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end.": 1, "Does anyone see him?": 1, "Does Dravynea know?": 1, "Dodge this!": 1, "Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.": 1, "Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away... ": 1, "Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.": 1, "A new batch of the Ashfire should be ready for bottling soon, unless the rieklings used it for bathwater.": 1, "Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.": 1, "Don't come too close with that.": 1, "A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines.": 1, "A most pleasant chat. Until the next!": 1, "Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.": 1, "Don't cause any trouble.": 1, "Don't cause any trouble in the city.": 1, "Don't break anything with that weapon, okay?": 1, "Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.": 1, "Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.": 1, "Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.": 1, "Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.": 1, "Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding.": 1, "Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.": 1, "Don't bother me again unless it's important.": 1, "Don't blame you one bit.": 1, "Don't blame me if your feet get sore.": 1, "Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.": 1, "Don't believe everything you hear, child.": 1, "Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.": 1, "Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this. Mother...": 1, "Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries? ": 1, "Don't be so sure of that. We've intercepted couriers from Solitude. The Empire's putting a great deal of pressure on Whiterun.": 1, "Don't be so petulant!": 1, "Don't be shy. You should be the one to carve.": 1, "Don't be ridiculous. Who would run this place?": 1, "Don't be ridiculous. Of course I can.": 1, "Don't be put off by my husband's mood... he enjoys having visitors.": 1, "Don't be like them. Don't feel sorry for me.": 1, "Don't be late, you don't want to miss your own wedding!": 1, "Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.": 1, "Don't I always?": 1, "Don't be. We all make mistakes.": 1, "Good. This is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials.": 1, "Dragons, is it? Does that make you the fabled \"Dragonborn\" we've heard mention of?": 1, "Dragons, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy.": 1, "A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a Forsworn agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess.": 1, "Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse.": 1, "Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.": 1, "Excellent. And now, please accept this token of appreciation.": 1, "Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all.": 1, "Excellent, here you are.": 1, "Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth.": 1, "Excellent! Thank you... Here, take this as, um, a sign of my gratitude. It's not much, but I hope it's enough.": 1, "Excellent! I'm sure you'll put those to good use.": 1, "Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than I could have.": 1, "Excellent work. ": 1, "Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?": 1, "Excellent work, child.": 1, "Excellent. I can't wait.": 1, "Excellent work!": 1, "Excavating isn't exactly my specialty. Even if it was, the ash storms fill it in faster than you can dig.": 1, "Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over.": 1, "Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?": 1, "Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.": 1, "Exactly. Something has to be directing them against us and we need to find out who, or what it is.": 1, "Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.": 1, "Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.": 1, "Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.": 1, "Exactly. It's a lost art. Most necromancers just raise up whatever bodies are nearby. A simple trick, really. Child's play.": 1, "Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support.": 1, "Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place.": 1, "Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?": 1, "Exactly!": 1, "Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College.": 1, "Exactly as I said it would. ": 1, "A magical shield that when blocked with, surrounds it's wielder with a holy aura that harms the undead.": 1, "Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.": 1, "Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone enter or leave?": 1, "Excuse me, but I'm trying to read.": 1, "Excuse me, but I must address the court.": 1, "Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head.": 1, "Excuse me, Councilor Morvayn? I have some wonderful news.": 1, "Except the ones attacked by Forsworn.": 1, "Except for you. You are my last challenge. Only you can send me to Sovngarde with honor.": 1, "Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours.": 1, "Excellent. Very good. This is exactly what I need to complete a series of studies I'm doing on Dwemer craftsmanship and magical resonance.": 1, "Excellent. They should be ready for us now.": 1, "Excellent. Then I grant you a title to the land.": 1, "Excellent. That's one less beast and nest of broodlings we needn't worry about any longer.": 1, "Excellent. That should prevent the problem from escalating.": 1, "Excellent. I knew I could count on you. That's one less trouble maker to keep an eye on.": 1, "Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use.": 1, "Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin.": 1, "Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do.": 1, "Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual.": 1, "Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?": 1, "Excellent. Looks like you've really driven them into hiding. Keep this up. We'll wipe them out, yet.": 1, "Excellent. Lead on, Thane.": 1, "Excellent. If this works, I'll prepare a version that you can cast yourself, if you ever wish to inflict... er, study silence.": 1, "Excellent. I'll take it.": 1, "Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway.": 1, "Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then. ": 1, "Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters.": 1, "Excellent. I trust she'll find her situation more accommodating, now that she is a member of the family.": 1, "Excellent. I trust he'll find his situation more accommodating, now that he is a member of the family.": 1, "Excellent. Show them no mercy.": 1, "Excuse me, but the Temple is for followers of our faith alone. Outsiders aren't welcome here.": 1, "Evgir Unslaad has come at last. The \"Season Unending.\" War... without end.": 1, "Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work.": 1, "Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet.": 1, "Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar.": 1, "Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life.": 1, "Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it.": 1, "Everyone has heard of the master wizards of Morrowind.": 1, "Everyone else, with me.": 1, "Everyone dead! Everyone but me...": 1, "Everybody ready? We charge on my signal.": 1, "Everybody pushes me around. Well no more!": 1, "Everybody get back!": 1, "Every winter, the ash from the angry mountains creeps closer.": 1, "Every type of fungus in Solstheim or Skyrim. Oh, and a few other ingredients and potions. ": 1, "Every time the Red Mountain belches, more of them land here. Look around for impact craters, exposed rock, that sort of thing.": 1, "Everyone knows it's the College's fault that the sea swallowed our city. Still they deny it, but we all know the truth.": 1, "Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face.": 1, "Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.": 1, "Every other day, seems one of the laborers runs off in the hills saying he'll join the Forsworn.": 1, "Every once in a while a local makes it out here. Although, they usually just want to catch a glimpse of Dusty. Silt Striders are pretty rare now.": 1, "Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.": 1, "Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em.": 1, "Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us. ": 1, "Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm.": 1, "Every last drop of your blood is mine!": 1, "Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that.": 1, "Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them.": 1, "Every day the threat of exile from Riften draws closer for myself and my family.": 1, "Every day it's the same thing. We open the shop, we hardly sell a thing, we close the shop and go to sleep.": 1, "Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable.": 1, "Every staff of his that I have uncovered has led me to greater understanding.": 1, "Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in.": 1, "Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.": 1, "Everyone looked and no one could find her. Wilhelm said she'll be back... told Narfi not to worry... Reyda will come back.": 1, "Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.": 1, "Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!": 1, "Everything's been torn down... the whole place looks... well, dead. It's like we're the first to set foot here in centuries.": 1, "Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling.": 1, "Everything you see here was made with skill and care by my wife Adrianne.": 1, "Everything well, Jesper?": 1, "Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.": 1, "Everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Ash spawn attacks, my house, and even my steward is assassinated.": 1, "Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.": 1, "Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.": 1, "Everything eventually tumbles down to you.": 1, "A man in my position makes lots of enemies. But what is a life-threatening situation if not an opportunity for mutual benefit? Hmmm?  ": 1, "A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.": 1, "Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.": 1, "A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.": 1, "Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.": 1, "Everyone's been talking about you. The guards will have to answer for throwing an innocent person in Cidhna Mine.": 1, "Everyone! Gather 'round!": 1, "Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round!": 1, "Everyone who's anyone. Viarmo bought an apple the other day, said he was looking for a new student.": 1, "Everyone to the keep!": 1, "Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...": 1, "Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong.": 1, "Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.": 1, "Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen.": 1, "Everyone please, stand back!": 1, "A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em.": 1, "Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you.": 1, "Everyone, fall back! Run for it!": 1, "Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him.": 1, "Excuse me, captain. Do you have any plans for the west end of town? We feel awfully exposed over there.": 1, "A lot of work to do around this place...": 1, "Farewell, friend. May the light of Auri-El illuminate your darkest hours.": 1, "Farewell, friend. May the glow of Auri-El shield you from your enemies.": 1, "Farewell, friend.": 1, "Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.": 1, "Farewell, farewell!": 1, "Farewell, and good journey milord.": 1, "Farewell, and good journey milady.": 1, "Farewell, Sabjorn.": 1, "Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?": 1, "Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows.": 1, "Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby.": 1, "Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project.": 1, "Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here.": 1, "Farewell, friend. May the radiance of Auri-El fill your heart with joy.": 1, "Farengar!": 1, "Farengar can explain the situation better than I can.": 1, "Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to.": 1, "Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is.": 1, "Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school.": 1, "Far from yourself.": 1, "Far from it. In fact, I'm no longer welcome there.": 1, "Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim.": 1, "Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong.": 1, "Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway.": 1, "Fancy robes. You a wizard or somethin'?": 1, "Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?": 1, "Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?": 1, "Fanari speaks her mind, perhaps more than she should.": 1, "Farengar is probably puttering around in his lab. Day and night. I'm not sure he ever sleeps.": 1, "Fanari shows what it means to be a leader to the Skaal. In time, perhaps I could lead as well.": 1, "Farewell, friend. May the warmth of Auri-El provide you strength.": 1, "Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight.": 1, "Father!": 1, "Father won't let me go see the dragon.": 1, "Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!": 1, "Father says I shouldn't play with you anymore.": 1, "Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher.": 1, "Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm.": 1, "Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.": 1, "Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?": 1, "Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!": 1, "Father never trusted Beem. I always thought he was just being overprotective.": 1, "Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.": 1, "Fastred, we must speak.": 1, "Fastred, I wanted to talk with you.": 1, "Farewell, kinsman.": 1, "Fastred, I have something to say to you.": 1, "Fascinating. By touching the stone, you appear to have fallen under whatever influence is affecting the others.": 1, "Fascinating.": 1, "Fascinating! So the ancients were more daring... or foolhardy... similar to the Dragon Break itself, although less far-reaching...": 1, "Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!": 1, "Farwag.": 1, "Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about \"injustices.\"": 1, "Farewell. Remember that Harkon's not to be trusted.": 1, "Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.": 1, "Farewell, strong one.": 1, "Farewell, stranger.": 1, "Farewell, sir.": 1, "Farewell, outsider.": 1, "Farewell, my lady.": 1, "Fascinating. I hope one of you dies.": 1, "A mage is only as good as what he knows. I try and make sure as much knowledge is available as possible.": 1, "Fanari says the Nords of Skyrim have many gods, but none are as wise and powerful as the All-Maker.": 1, "Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy.": 1, "Faida's the name. I keep the inn.": 1, "Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.": 1, "Faida came by today. She says you left the tavern last night without paying for your drinks.": 1, "Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him.": 1, "Fade in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains.": 1, "Face your death with some courage, thief.": 1, "Face me, then! Zu'u Alduin!": 1, "Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same.": 1, "Faaz! Paak! Dinok!": 1, "Faas nu, zini dein ruthi ahst vaal.": 1, "Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne...": 1, "Faa thoo.": 1, "Eyyaargh!": 1, "Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, \"a blood price.\" I did not ask him to elaborate on that point.": 1, "Eyes open. Danger could be anywhere.": 1, "Exploring, huh? Most folks think this place isn't worth the effort.": 1, "Explore the facets of the infinite jewel. ": 1, "Exploiting? What's that supposed to mean? Erik works the farm because he's a good lad!": 1, "Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you.": 1, "Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.": 1, "Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.": 1, "Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately.": 1, "Excuse us. I need to fetch the Bloodstone Chalice.": 1, "Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments.": 1, "Excuse me? What kind of question is that?": 1, "Excuse me? I told you we should go to my family's home. ": 1, "Excuse me? How can you be so certain?": 1, "Excuse me. What's your business here?": 1, "Eyes open.": 1, "Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl.": 1, "Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?": 1, "Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing.": 1, "Families torn apart?": 1, "Falmer, if I understand Arkay correctly.": 1, "Falmer up ahead.": 1, "Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.": 1, "Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life.": 1, "Fall to me, dragon!": 1, "Fall before the will of Sithis!": 1, "Fall before me!": 1, "Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.": 1, "Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.": 1, "Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!": 1, "Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put.": 1, "Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine.": 1, "Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.": 1, "Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund.": 1, "Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.": 1, "Falk said I could count on you.": 1, "Falion, I am disappointed.": 1, "Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it.": 1, "Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago.": 1, "Faleen... I...": 1, "Falaraga!": 1, "Faith's just going to have to wait, Elder. I'm sorry.": 1, "Fairly well, I'd say. I've managed to get this far without blowing myself up, I still have all my limbs...": 1, "Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.": 1, "Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister.": 1, "Fair is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.": 1, "Fair fight. Here you are.": 1, "Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.": 1, "Dragons, murder, rebellion... and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor on board.": 1, "Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun. ": 1, "Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.": 1, "Either way, they will sing songs of our bravery around the campfires for many years.": 1, "Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful.": 1, "Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!": 1, "Either way, I came back with meat for the table.": 1, "Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn.": 1, "Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me.": 1, "Either that, or perhaps a daedra. If so, then may the nine protect us.": 1, "Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.": 1, "Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys.": 1, "Either of you?": 1, "Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both.": 1, "Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.": 1, "Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad.": 1, "Either way, this is the end of it. ": 1, "Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead.": 1, "Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?": 1, "Eh? Who's there? Rodulf, that you?": 1, "Eh? Did you say something?": 1, "Eh... You see... I've been thinking about Faleen quite a bit. You know Faleen?": 1, "Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world. ": 1, "Eh, not so bad.": 1, "Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself.": 1, "Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind.": 1, "Egh!": 1, "Eerelaya.": 1, "Eeeeloo.": 1, "Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.": 1, "Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one.": 1, "Eight septims per day, plus lodging.": 1, "Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry.": 1, "Either you're here to get showered in sparks, or you're looking for something to buy. Out with it.": 1, "Elda, honey, let's not talk about the war. It's in the past.": 1, "Empire? What... what empire?": 1, "Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves. ": 1, "Empire loves their damn lists.": 1, "Emperor Pelagius III.": 1, "Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye.": 1, "Embers lie nestled in stone, needing only fuel to bloom to a flame that will warm all around them.": 1, "Elynea is waiting for fresh taproot before she can regrow that chamber.": 1, "Elynea is our alchemist. She specializes in mushrooms and other types of fungus.": 1, "Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment.": 1, "Eltrys, yes, just last season we were wed.": 1, "Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always.": 1, "Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.": 1, "Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.": 1, "Either you're lying to me, or...": 1, "Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind.": 1, "Elf-ears!": 1, "Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.": 1, "Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.": 1, "Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows.": 1, "Elenwen must be very fond of you.": 1, "Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.": 1, "Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.": 1, "Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.": 1, "Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic.": 1, "Elder, why have the Reclamations destroyed the Tribunal?": 1, "Elder, we barely have enough men to keep the town safe as it is. I can't pull them off watch.": 1, "Elder Othreloth is grooming me to be his eventual replacement. Soon, I'll be running the Temple my way.": 1, "Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through.": 1, "Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd.": 1, "Empty your pockets or end up as skeever food.": 1, "Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you.": 1, "Eat up, Svari.": 1, "Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!": 1, "Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!": 1, "Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for \"spices.\" Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?": 1, "Dreyla, I have a message for you.": 1, "Dreyla! I told you I didn't want you seeing him anymore. Must I lock you into the house at night?": 1, "Dress yourself.": 1, "Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer.": 1, "Drennen!": 1, "Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov.": 1, "Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way.": 1, "Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?": 1, "Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.": 1, "Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax.": 1, "Drinking it gives you strength, but it also gets you pretty messed up... That's why we thought of putting it in the skooma.": 1, "Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in qahnaar... denial of the greater.": 1, "Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?": 1, "Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?": 1, "Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.": 1, "Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?": 1, "Draugr-breath!": 1, "Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it.": 1, "Draugr are below. Foul tasting.": 1, "Draugr again. I mean... we should have expected it, right? What else do you find in these damn crypts, but waves and waves of draugr?": 1, "Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city.": 1, "Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?": 1, "Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that.": 1, "Dragons... even on Solstheim. I can't believe it.": 1, "Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind.": 1, "Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home.": 1, "Eat? No, I don't think I'm... hungry. Not now, at least.": 1, "Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap.": 1, "Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.": 1, "Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word.": 1, "Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.": 1, "Easy, huh? So, should I just hand you purses of coin or are you going to work to earn your keep?": 1, "Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself.": 1, "Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.": 1, "Easy for you to say. You get to fight.": 1, "Easy does it.": 1, "Easy does it now.": 1, "East Empire Company called it \"a terrible accident,\" claiming that he was lost in a rockfall, but I know better.": 1, "Easily blocked!": 1, "Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.": 1, "Eager to make some coin, eh? That's the spirit.": 1, "Each sought to gain power by using his underling to kill you and keep the Chalice for himself.": 1, "Driven out of my own home. After all this, I can't believe it.": 1, "Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.": 1, "Dwemer mechanisms have no sense of self preservation.": 1, "Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.": 1, "During the Oblivion Crisis, gates to the plane of Oblivion opened all over Morrowind.": 1, "Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?": 1, "Dug out a pile of the stuff taller than me just to find the barrow. Who knows how much to reach the door.": 1, "Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.": 1, "Drunk again, Embry? Don't let Alvor hear you talking to me that way. He'll stick your head in his forge.": 1, "Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.": 1, "Drovas, where's my tea?": 1, "Drovas, I thought I told you I needed the jazbay crushed for my Emberbrand Wine. Where is it?": 1, "Drovas! I need you to clean the rooms again. I went through there, and there's ash everywhere.": 1, "Drovas Revli owes me 1000 septims.": 1, "Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.": 1, "Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.": 1, "Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.": 1, "Enchanted ice as hard as iron and cold as death. Stalhrim can be forged into deadly weapons, but the art is known only to smiths of the Skaal.": 1, "Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.": 1, "Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.": 1, "Even the legendary sandstorms of Vvardenfell's Molag Amur Region were said to barely make a dent in them. Of course, that's all ash now.": 1, "Even the dead need company. That's what Arkay provides.": 1, "Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!": 1, "Even so, there is more than enough evidence that someone is out to get me.": 1, "Even so, I pick up a lot from just watching him.": 1, "Even so, I almost made it... another foot or two to the side, and the water would have broken my fall. But... nothing I could do.": 1, "Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all.": 1, "Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...": 1, "Even now, the All-Maker watches over us.": 1, "Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors. ": 1, "Even my claws feel sharper.": 1, "Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.": 1, "Even though the Argonian Invasion ended a long time ago, there are still a few scale-skin clans that live within our borders.": 1, "Even its name is an echo. ": 1, "Even in the Soul Cairn, the defeat of the World Eater has reached my ears, Dovahkiin.": 1, "Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.": 1, "Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble.": 1, "Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door.": 1, "Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door.": 1, "Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy.": 1, "Even if he won't help the Vigilants, he could at least offer us shelter for the moment.": 1, "Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in.": 1, "Even if I could, it would only serve to hinder your efforts.": 1, "Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed. What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!": 1, "Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.": 1, "Even dragons submit to Miraak's Voice. Without that power, you cannot face him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora, master of the tides of Fate.": 1, "Even before that, we weren't the most normal family. We did worship a daedra, remember?": 1, "Even in this weather, it's better than the cave.": 1, "Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord, Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment.": 1, "Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward.": 1, "Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful.": 1, "Every Dunmer left a piece of themselves behind when they departed our homeland. All we can do is make the most of what we have.": 1, "Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.": 1, "Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?": 1, "Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?": 1, "Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.": 1, "Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.": 1, "Ever think about spending more time around town?": 1, "Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here.": 1, "Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though.": 1, "Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?": 1, "Ever since he decided to make that prophecy his calling, we kind of drifted apart.": 1, "Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.": 1, "Ever seen a book called \"The Mirror\"? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.": 1, "Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis.": 1, "Ever see someone killed with their own weapon? Would you like to?": 1, "Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels.": 1, "Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.": 1, "Eventually, the Star will fade back into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait.": 1, "Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.": 1, "Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.": 1, "Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.": 1, "Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than to feed.": 1, "Even with these vampires gone, the fight isn't completely over. Once we're settled back in at the fort, there will be more work to do.": 1, "Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits.": 1, "Even with all my preparations, we can't be too careful. The monsters could strike at us at any moment.": 1, "Even with Vyrthur gone and the Inner Sanctum destroyed, my duty as a Knight-Paladin of Auri-El remains.": 1, "Even while making parts up.": 1, "Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!": 1, "Ever onward.": 1, "Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!": 1, "Even a necromancer as seasoned as my mother would be willing to spend years trying to gain access to them.": 1, "Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!": 1, "Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.": 1, "Enough to know that it's not worth it.": 1, "Enough talk. Let's go kill some Imperials.": 1, "Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.": 1, "Enough of this! Fight me!": 1, "A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.": 1, "Enough of these games. Fight me!": 1, "Enough of these games.": 1, "Enough hiding. Come out and face me.": 1, "Enough games, let's finish this!": 1, "Enough games, let's end this!": 1, "Enough for now. But I'll either need to get some more barrels or start importing more if we're going to make it through next winter.": 1, "Enough already. Put on some clothes. You're making people nervous.": 1, "Enough! ": 1, "Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.": 1, "Enjoying your newfound abilities I trust?": 1, "Enjoying the hospitalities of the inn. Suggest you do the same.": 1, "Enjoy yourself.": 1, "Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.": 1, "Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!": 1, "Enjoy your last breath!": 1, "Enjoy your hunt.": 1, "Enjoy this while you can. Soon you will all be slaves.": 1, "Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.": 1, "Enemies of the Empire will fall!": 1, "Endon, we talked about this... Are you still disappointed in Cade's choice?": 1, "Endon, dear, please don't.... Save your frustrations for work.": 1, "Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here.": 1, "Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?": 1, "Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army.": 1, "Enough! Both of you!": 1, "Enough! We can't imprison the very people that own the jail we would be throwing them into. The Silver-Blood family are to be left alone, am I clear?": 1, "Even I'll admit it hasn't been the Empire's finest hour. But it wasn't like the Emperor had any choice, did he?": 1, "Even I cannot see past Time's ending to what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the best we can with this world.": 1, "Especially not me. I mean... with my history, I still kind of get a chill just walking by a temple. Can't imagine going in one.": 1, "Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully.": 1, "Esbern. What are you getting at?": 1, "Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.": 1, "Esbern, what...": 1, "Esbern, look out!": 1, "Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate.": 1, "Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.": 1, "Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.": 1, "Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?": 1, "Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation.": 1, "Enough! That's enough. I surrender... I surrender.": 1, "Er, rather, have a nice day, citizen.": 1, "Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.": 1, "Eorlund Gray-Mane's a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor.": 1, "Eorlund Gray-Mane was a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor. Now he's dead.": 1, "Eola is a fine host. She really keeps the faithful together.": 1, "Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.": 1, "Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.": 1, "Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!": 1, "Enough... of this!": 1, "Enough... enough...": 1, "Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.": 1, "Enough. Let's go.": 1, "Enough, Vyrthur. Give us the bow!": 1, "Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers.": 1, "Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry? Would you like me to fix you something?": 1, "Good. This is a city that respects strength. Honors it. A good lesson for children to learn.": 1, "Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.": 1, "Good. Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.": 1, "Hmm? What's this about?": 1, "Hmm? What're you doing?": 1, "Hmm? What is it?": 1, "Hmm? What do you want?": 1, "Hmm? What about?": 1, "Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out.": 1, "Hmm? Show yourself!": 1, "Hmm? Oh. Raven Rock. Right.": 1, "Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself.": 1, "Hmm? Oh, yes.": 1, "Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed.": 1, "Hmm? Oh, no. No, not really. I... Actually, I've forgotten what I was looking for.": 1, "Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do... what? Are they on me?": 1, "Hmm? What? Project? You think you could help me? I really don't think so.": 1, "Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago.": 1, "Hmm...looks like it needs some sort of key. Maybe those half claws you found would fit in here if you put them together?": 1, "Hmm....": 1, "Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand...": 1, "Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.": 1, "Hmm... well, you can pick up where I left off. My notes should still be in my journal, if you can read it.": 1, "Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.": 1, "Hmm... looks like it's all here. Okay, go on through. But stick to the road, and don't make any sudden moves.": 1, "Hmm... it's all here. Well, then... looks like I have a good bit of work to start on.": 1, "Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.": 1, "Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the \"Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire\"?": 1, "Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery. ": 1, "Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat.": 1, "Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things.": 1, "Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.": 1, "Hmm... Perhaps something is meant to go into the fire?": 1, "Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...": 1, "Hmmm, Olaf did become king and Numinex escaped later. It's entirely possible... and I'm sure the court will like that, I'm writing it in.": 1, "Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something.": 1, "Hmph. Fine.": 1, "Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.": 1, "Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death...": 1, "Hmph. Damn you for being right.": 1, "Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.": 1, "Hmph. Beat me to it, this time.": 1, "Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis.": 1, "Hmph. \"Solitude.\" Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...": 1, "A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you. ": 1, "Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected.": 1, "Hmph, maybe. Been difficult trusting people lately, they think I'm crazy.": 1, "Hmph, he's begging for patrons again, eh? Well, I suppose I could have just a bit.": 1, "Hmmm, I'd say five of them would be enough.": 1, "Hmmmm... \"Fixed\" is such a subjective term. I think \"treated\" is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face.": 1, "Hmmm... interesting... those dwarves were clever creatures. I'll tinker around with these techniques and see what I can come up with around here.": 1, "Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of... ": 1, "Hmmm... Well, maybe we could go on a sort of trip. Take the wares on the road. Get some new customers.": 1, "Hmmm... No, that's probably not of any use.": 1, "Hmmm... I see. Clever dwarves. With a similar technique and a little tinkering I should be able to improve the capabilities of our crossbows.": 1, "Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.": 1, "Hmmm. Pull chains and traps. Be careful here. Whatever's on the other side of this, the Falmer wanted to keep there.": 1, "Hmmm. Not bad. We'd better hope that's good enough. Mistakes with these kinds of portals can be... gruesome.": 1, "Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.": 1, "Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away.": 1, "Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?": 1, "Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to.": 1, "Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious.": 1, "Hmmm?": 1, "A coin or two for a veteran? It's not much to ask...": 1, "A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way.": 1, "Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements.": 1, "Hmm. I might have a few staffs, if you're interested in that sort of thing.": 1, "Hmm. I expected you to die. Oh, well.": 1, "Hmm. I don't want to get involved in anything beneath my dignity as Jarl.": 1, "Hmm. I don't see anything.": 1, "Hmm. I do have a new spell I'm working on. I hope to be able to conjure ash spawn.": 1, "Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?": 1, "Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such things that joorre do not.": 1, "Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through all that, you're likely worth something to me.": 1, "Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.": 1, "Hmm. From the way they are waving about, I'm assuming they aren't under your control.": 1, "Hmm. Excellent question. ": 1, "Hmm. Cowards.": 1, "Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.": 1, "Hmm. I think I could talk the councilor into paying you, and I could use an extra pair of hands.": 1, "Hmm. Better than average quality. I'll take it.": 1, "Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?": 1, "Hmm, nothing there after all.": 1, "Hmm, nothing down here.": 1, "Hmm, no, you look fine. Well, at least no different than when I first saw you.": 1, "Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got.": 1, "Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out.": 1, "Hmm, here's another mention of the guardian. I can only assume that this is the guardian's tomb we are standing in now.": 1, "Hmm, I suppose I can work with your face. After all, the sculptor cannot always choose the finest clay.": 1, "Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates.": 1, "Hm? What was that?": 1, "Hm? What do you need?": 1, "Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments.": 1, "Hm? Something's near...": 1, "Hmm. As you say.": 1, "Hmm... All right... How about this?": 1, "Hmm. I was sure I heard something.": 1, "Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!": 1, "Hmm...": 1, "Hmm. Your eyes appear to be completely back to normal. Interesting.": 1, "A coward hides. A true warrior does not.": 1, "Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne.": 1, "Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage.": 1, "Hmm. What's this?": 1, "Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan.": 1, "Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away.": 1, "Hmm. Well now. This is all very fascinating, but I don't recall asking to you to touch anything in here.": 1, "Hmm. We shall see.": 1, "Hmm. Very well. Just tell me what you desire - beauty or hideous deformity, nothing is beyond my skill.": 1, "Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.": 1, "Hmm. This place was deserted when I was here last.": 1, "Hmm. I'll have to get someone to bring this to my lab.": 1, "Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.": 1, "Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice.": 1, "Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?": 1, "Hmm. Still no steam. You didn't remove any of the cubes downstairs, did you?": 1, "Hmm. Sounds like something from a dream, and yet it might be more. Strange.": 1, "Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner.": 1, "Hmm. Reminds me of the standing stones back home.": 1, "Hmm. Pity that one of our own people doesn't fully grasp our ways.": 1, "Hmm. Nothing.": 1, "Hmm. Nothing, I guess.": 1, "Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.": 1, "Hmm. It appears that you were not as unusual after all.": 1, "Hmm. I've known for decades that heart stones will animate the ash.": 1, "Hmm. I'm running out of giant toes. I'll pay extra for one.": 1, "Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?": 1, "Hm... three pillars. Other than that plaque, there doesn't seem to be anything else worthy of note. Let's see what the inscription says.": 1, "Hmph. Hadn't expected you had it in you. Here. Take this for a job well done.": 1, "Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay.": 1, "Hooojarakwafala!": 1, "Hoooh!": 1, "Hoola wakasee.": 1, "Honorless thief!": 1, "Honored guests.": 1, "Honor me with a task, outlander. Bring the sword to my daughter, if you see her. It'll be all she needs to know.": 1, "A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.": 1, "Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate.": 1, "Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...": 1, "Honestly. Have you any idea?": 1, "Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.": 1, "Honestly, I don't think they care what a bunch of vampires would do with Auriel's Bow. They're pretty focused on the past.": 1, "Honestly, I don't know. Necromancers are always interested in souls, though, so that probably has some kind of interest.": 1, "Hooray for the Arch-Mage!": 1, "Honestly, I can't keep up. But by all means, don't stop now.": 1, "Honest pay for honest work.": 1, "Honest gold for honest work.": 1, "Home? Where's that?": 1, "Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!": 1, "Holding him? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner.": 1, "Hold, traveler. You have no business here. Be on your way.": 1, "Hold, traveler. You have no business here.": 1, "Hold, there!": 1, "Hold, on there. I think I just remembered something. The last time we handed out pay.": 1, "Hold, mage, and listen well...": 1, "Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!": 1, "Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it.": 1, "Hold up. We... need to talk.": 1, "Honest, I didn't take it!": 1, "Hold there.": 1, "Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!": 1, "Hope the moths like that bark as much as Dexion said they would.": 1, "House Redoran took charge and was slowly able to build an army. It took years, but it became a force to be reckoned with.": 1, "House Redoran has improved Blacklight substantially over the last thousand years... its grandeur rivals that of Mournhold itself.": 1, "House Hlaalu will... have its revenge...": 1, "Hot fire. Cold dizzydrink. Happy tribe.": 1, "Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?": 1, "Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm.": 1, "Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.": 1, "Horrible things. Experiments...and worse.": 1, "Horkers' revenge!": 1, "Horker-face!": 1, "Horker skin, actually.": 1, "Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.": 1, "Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true.": 1, "Hope Pavo will be able to go back to his mine soon. Everyone needs a home.": 1, "Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place.": 1, "Hopefully these gifts will put us in her good graces, secure that import deal, and lead the way to an audience with the Emperor. ": 1, "Hopefully the frost lessons are over.": 1, "Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.": 1, "Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing.": 1, "Hopefully he'll be gracious enough to make you one of us again.": 1, "Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.": 1, "Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.": 1, "Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!": 1, "Hope you're getting along with Isran. He takes some getting used to.": 1, "Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.": 1, "Hope we don't run into too many ash spawn out here.": 1, "Hope this war lasts long enough that I get to fight in it. Battle! Glory!": 1, "Hope they don't get carried away here.": 1, "Hopefully they made it to safety before the attack.  I'll begin the search after a quick restock.": 1, "Hmph. Hardly a challenge.": 1, "Hold still...": 1, "Hold still, then.": 1, "Hmph. What secrets could they have worth keeping from old Mora? Sounds like a bargain to me.": 1, "Hmph. What a boring conversation.": 1, "Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine.": 1, "Hmph. Well, beauty's in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.": 1, "Hmph. Very well. I'll just have to find someone else to assist us then.": 1, "Hmph. This city's crawling with thieves. Cowards. Kid could learn some bad habits here.": 1, "Hmph. That remains to be seen.": 1, "Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.": 1, "Hmph. Suit yourself.": 1, "Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.": 1, "Hmph. Plenty.": 1, "Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.": 1, "Hmph. Now there's an excellent question. An excellent question, indeed. Truth is, as soon as the Emperor sets sail,  I'm resigning my position.": 1, "Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill.": 1, "Hmph. No, friend, that I'm not. But I get along with your kind well enough.": 1, "Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.": 1, "Hmph. Music tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.": 1, "Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there. ": 1, "Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.": 1, "Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.": 1, "Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven.": 1, "Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.": 1, "Hmph. I tell you what's crazy.": 1, "Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.": 1, "Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother.": 1, "Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.": 1, "Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?": 1, "Hmph. Help them drink up our mead, you mean.": 1, "Hmph. No arrows protruding from your skull... Can I assume Anoriath is dead, then?": 1, "Hold still. Let me get a good look at you.": 1, "Hmph. Yes, Nepos.": 1, "Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you.": 1, "Hold on. We didn't know it was you we were messing with. Look, we'll let him go and call it even, all right? No need for any more trouble.": 1, "Hold on. We didn't know it was you we were messing with. Look, we'll let her go and call it even, all right? No need for any more trouble.": 1, "Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place.": 1, "Hold on, what was that?": 1, "Hold on, there. I suppose, in the uh, interest of research... I can spare a few more coins. Double and a half its value. That's all I can muster.": 1, "Hold on, now. I'm just a simple sailor. I never wanted to get mixed up in any of this. Alright, I'll take you. But we leave immediately.": 1, "Hold on, now, we only want to...": 1, "Hold on, my dear. Hold on!": 1, "Hold on, my boy. Hold on!": 1, "Hold it. This here's a toll road, see? Yer gonna have to hand over, say, 200 gold if you want to use our road.": 1, "Hold it. If you're going downstairs, you keep your weapons to yourself or we'll be getting better acquainted.": 1, "Hold it! She's the one Tolan mentioned.": 1, "Hold it! He's the one Tolan mentioned.": 1, "Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then.": 1, "Hold it right there.": 1, "Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.": 1, "Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?": 1, "Hold a moment, Mogrul.": 1, "Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm.": 1, "Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.": 1, "Hod. Just come here.": 1, "Hod! Come here a minute. I need your help with something.": 1, "Ho, now... Keep me out of this...": 1, "Ho, Gorm.": 1, "Hmph... not very impressive, is it?": 1, "Hmph... maybe so. Then again, I thought I could, too.": 1, "Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.": 1, "Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.": 1, "Hold and stand down.": 1, "House Telvanni has it's properties on Vvardenfell. I've never been to the mainland myself.": 1, "Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?": 1, "Hm. Did I call it \"The Great Hunt\" or was it just \"The Hunt?\" Bah, I can't remember!": 1, "Hern and I do so adore guests! These guards are such a bore.": 1, "Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.": 1, "Hermaeus Mora... old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's power. Of course.": 1, "Hermaeus Mora learns some fascinating new ways to skin a horker, and you become the second most powerful Dragonborn that ever lived.": 1, "Hermaeus Mora has always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of forbidden knowledge.": 1, "Herma-Mora forced you to serve him in order to defeat Miraak. Do not let him lure you further down that path.": 1, "Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!": 1, "Here... it's not much, but it's the best an old, retired miner can do.": 1, "Here. You deserve a reward for your service.": 1, "Here. This was something I carried around in happier times. Maybe you can find a use for it.": 1, "A dastardly group, but they're more than simple brigands. Shrewd. Clever. Not to be trifled with.": 1, "Here. This is for you.": 1, "Here. Take this. I hope you like it.": 1, "Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it.": 1, "Here. Take this. For your time and all that.": 1, "Here. Take these. I'll sell you more if you come back later.": 1, "Here. Something I want you to have. Now, don't embarrass either of us by saying something sappy. Just... take it.": 1, "Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.": 1, "Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.": 1, "Here. Let me show you how this works...": 1, "Here. Let me show you how it's made...": 1, "Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement.": 1, "Here. It isn't much, but... I hope it's the thought that counts.": 1, "Here. I want you to have this.": 1, "A debt. Is a debt.": 1, "Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you.": 1, "Here. I hope you choke on it.": 1, "Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him.": 1, "A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed.": 1, "Here. Have some septims.": 1, "Heroes. They get greedier every century.": 1, "Hevnoraak is defeated.": 1, "Hey! This could be handy!": 1, "Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up.": 1, "A cure? Why even think of it that way? ": 1, "Hey! Stop that.": 1, "Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!": 1, "Hey! Over here! Get me out of here!": 1, "Hey! My hangover is gone!": 1, "Hey! Journal?": 1, "Hey! It's the bard-to-be.": 1, "Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.": 1, "Hey! I can't see myself! What did you do to me?": 1, "Hey! Hands off!": 1, "Hey! Grab my journal. If you survive, you're going to need it.": 1, "Het siiv nunon dinok.": 1, "Hey! Good to see you again.": 1, "Hey you! Let me out! I can help!": 1, "Hey there, friend. If you're looking for a fix, you're at the right place. Just head on down the trap door.": 1, "Hey there! I was wondering if I'd run into you out here.": 1, "Hey there! Check out what my friend and I found. I'll sell some of it to you, if you want!": 1, "Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here?": 1, "Hey now, you be careful with that fire.": 1, "Hey now, don't take all the good stuff!": 1, "Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?": 1, "Hey gossip, bring me a drink.": 1, "Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?": 1, "Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?": 1, "Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy.": 1, "Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.": 1, "Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach.": 1, "Hey! Those belong to my family!": 1, "Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.": 1, "Here. For you. For my hatchling of the heart.": 1, "Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands.": 1, "Here, take a look.": 1, "Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march.": 1, "Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good.": 1, "Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude.": 1, "Here, my friend. A few septims, to show my thanks, hmm? And may that twisted little jester rot in a cell for a fortnight! ": 1, "Here, like this. Go, bring two hands of redgrass. Be friend of tribe-kin.": 1, "Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do.": 1, "Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith.": 1, "Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble.": 1, "Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over.": 1, "Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me.": 1, "Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired.": 1, "Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back.": 1, "Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.": 1, "Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again.": 1, "Here, have some food instead.": 1, "Here, have one on me.": 1, "Here, give this map to the blacksmith. I have no further need of it.": 1, "Here, for your trouble.": 1, "Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me.": 1, "Here, a reward from your Jarl.": 1, "Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.": 1, "Here, I'll just remove it. Here's a bit of coin. Should help mitigate your inconvenience.": 1, "Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it.": 1, "Here, I want you to take this key. Head inside my house and unlock the door in the basement.": 1, "Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use.": 1, "Here, I usually pay researchers for their work when they emerge from the ruins, but they won't be needing it anymore.": 1, "Here, how about a little token for your efforts? My family's ring and all the things the guards confiscated from you when you were jailed.": 1, "Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.": 1, "Here, take the Goldenglow Estate Deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive.": 1, "Here, take these. They should help you during your journeys.": 1, "Here. For you. Don't thank me, just take it.": 1, "Here. A little something for you.": 1, "Here.": 1, "Here, you should take a crossbow. Good for taking out those fiends before they get close.": 1, "Here, you should have this.": 1, "Here, you deserve a bit of reward for your efforts... that was a lengthy trip for you, I'm sure!": 1, "Here, why don't you take this. It was intended to be given to the best in their group as a reward for their hard work.": 1, "Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the occasion.": 1, "Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me...": 1, "Here, this key should open the front door of the manor in case they've locked it. Good luck.": 1, "Here, this key should open the door to the tomb.": 1, "A decade ago, this drove him into a deep depression. He shut himself inside his home and refused to come out.": 1, "Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough.": 1, "Here, take these samples of the sujamma and spread the word. If you get rid of all of them, there's something extra in it for you.": 1, "Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought.": 1, "Here, take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.": 1, "Here, take this. I used to carry it for good luck, but I think you deserve it more than I do.": 1, "Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods.": 1, "Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out.": 1, "Here, take this small token of appreciation for your efforts.": 1, "Here, take this one and give it a try. You'll want to get to know how to use it if you really plan to join the Dawnguard.": 1, "Here, take this for your trouble.": 1, "Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.": 1, "Here, take this as a small token of my esteem.": 1, "Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief.": 1, "Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!": 1, "Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting.": 1, "Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root.": 1, "Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War.": 1, "Hm. Most interesting.": 1, "Hey! We got a deader over here!": 1, "Hey! What're you doing in here?": 1, "His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.": 1, "His desire to return to your world will spread my influence more widely. But it will also set him free from my direct control.": 1, "His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart his lust for the throne.": 1, "His best work was buried with him, though. A set that my patron calls \"the Relics\" are supposed to be down in his tomb.": 1, "His ambition will justify any actions. Put your faith in him, and you will regret it, I promise you.": 1, "Hircine go with you.": 1, "Hin sil fen nahkip bahloki.": 1, "Hin laas los dii.": 1, "Hin aar, orin nu. And yet here I am, still your prisoner.": 1, "Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all.": 1, "Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years. ": 1, "High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.": 1, "Hiding? The shadows are my domain!": 1, "His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts.": 1, "Hiding won't help you!": 1, "Hiding will not save you now.": 1, "Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.": 1, "Hiding is beneath you, Dragonborn.": 1, "Hide if you wish. It's only a matter of time.": 1, "Hide if you wish, it matters little to me.": 1, "Hi, Marise. How are you today?": 1, "Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?": 1, "Hi Mister! Would you like to buy some flowers? Please?": 1, "Hi Lady! Would you like to buy some flowers? Please?": 1, "Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.": 1, "Hhhhuuuuuhhh....": 1, "Heyargh!": 1, "Hey... is someone watching me?": 1, "Hiding will not save you!": 1, "Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.": 1, "His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City. ": 1, "His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy.": 1, "Hm, perhaps I'll make an offering to the All-Maker. He can make our potatoes ripen as surely as he makes the snow fall from the sky.": 1, "Hm, I wonder if I should have brought more torches.": 1, "Hm, I wonder if I should find something warmer to wear...": 1, "Hm, I do not remember Baldor acting strangely. Although, now that you ask, I did see something in the woods on the day he disappeared.": 1, "Hm hmm.": 1, "Hlaalu deserved every bit of the hatred they received once the Empire released its grasp on Morrowind.": 1, "Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!": 1, "Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.": 1, "Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?": 1, "Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften.": 1, "Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?": 1, "Hit me harder!": 1, "History truly comes alive here, don't you think?": 1, "His incompetence made this mess. Let's see how he decides to clean it up.": 1, "Hist spit on you.": 1, "His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt.": 1, "His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.": 1, "His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!": 1, "His perception may be more coherent than ours.": 1, "His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.": 1, "His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been up to all this time.": 1, "His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?": 1, "His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.": 1, "His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.": 1, "His name was Torsten Cruel-Sea. He was really rich, 'cause he owned a whole farm called Hollyfrost.": 1, "His name is Torsten Cruel-Sea. He's really rich, 'cause he owns a farm called Hollyfrost.": 1, "His name is Nikulas. He's a good lad, strong and loyal. I only wish he wasn't so eager to leave the village.": 1, "His men dressed up and then went out to fight, but they reversed Olaf's orders much to Winterhold's sorrow.": 1, "His story is as old as Solstheim itself.": 1, "Hey! What are you trying to pull?": 1, "A crown doesn't make a king. ": 1, "Hey, you. You're finally awake.": 1, "Hey, high elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you.": 1, "Hey, here. Have one on the house.": 1, "Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here.": 1, "Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?": 1, "Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?": 1, "Hey, dark elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?": 1, "Hey, can I get a gold or two?": 1, "Hey, a fight!": 1, "Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you.": 1, "Hey, Redguard. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?": 1, "Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em.": 1, "Hey, Orc. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?": 1, "Hey, Khajiit. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet. Come back here!": 1, "Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble.": 1, "Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me.": 1, "Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss.": 1, "Hey, Breton. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, Argonian. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey! You're the one that hurt me!": 1, "Hey! You trying to pull a fast one on me?": 1, "Hey! You planning to steal something? Don't even think about it.": 1, "Hey! Where did I go?": 1, "Hey! What's this?": 1, "Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?": 1, "Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on...": 1, "Hey, if you don't like it, you could always shop for your Elder Scrolls elsewhere.": 1, "Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.": 1, "Hey, you. Stop right there!": 1, "Hey, you. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you.": 1, "Hey, you're not supposed to be down here. Official business only.": 1, "Hey, you lazy milk-drinkers, get over here!": 1, "Hey, you don't look so good...": 1, "Hey, wood elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, who's there?": 1, "Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here.": 1, "Hey, where are you going. I need those pages!": 1, "Hey, what village are you from horse thief?": 1, "Hey, what the...?": 1, "Hey, welcome to the mill!": 1, "Hey, if you find a book called \"Night Falls on Sentinel,\" could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have.": 1, "Hey, uh, don't tell Isran I was afraid to meet him by myself. Not the best first impression for a new vampire hunter, I guess.": 1, "Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk.": 1, "Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it.": 1, "Hey, that's a valuable animal!": 1, "Hey, that isn't yours!": 1, "Hey, so... before we go in there...": 1, "Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?": 1, "Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load.": 1, "Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!": 1, "Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!": 1, "Hey, kinsman. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!": 1, "Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials.": 1, "Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?": 1, "Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made.": 1, "Hey, there's my bow! There, out on the log. Wondered what happened to it.": 1, "Here, I picked up this cube for you.": 1, "House Telvanni is the house of the master wizard, one of the ruling houses of Morrowind.": 1, "How about \"The Lusty Argonian Maid\"?": 1, "I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.": 1, "I am called Wulf Wild-Blood. I am First Hunter of the Skaal.": 1, "I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.": 1, "I am but your humble servant, milord.": 1, "I am but your humble servant, milady.": 1, "I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility.": 1, "I am busy keeping this family in coin and your pretty little head adorned with jewels, so I'll thank you not to question where I go at night, wife.": 1, "I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.": 1, "I am at your service.": 1, "I am at your service, as always.": 1, "I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.": 1, "I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.": 1, "I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College.": 1, "I am close, so close! You must force him to see reason!": 1, "I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief.": 1, "I am afraid you're beyond my meager abiliities. I am sorry I cannot serve you better.": 1, "I am above the petty squabbles here. I have lived for far too long to be bothered with them.": 1, "I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard. ": 1, "I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good.": 1, "I am a prisoner here. Please, you must help me.": 1, "I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it. ": 1, "I am a master wizard of the House Telvanni. Other people make tea for me.": 1, "I am a master wizard of House Telvanni!": 1, "I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.": 1, "I am Uglarz, huntress of all.": 1, "I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold.": 1, "I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!": 1, "I am Othreloth, Elder of the Reclamations and keeper of this Temple.": 1, "I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage.": 1, "I am Master Neloth's apprentice. He's teaching me the art of sorcery.": 1, "I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I am done with you. You may go.": 1, "I am not. I have no more taste for Thalmor wine than I do for Thalmor company.": 1, "I am not yours to toy with!": 1, "I am not your plaything, worm!": 1, "I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready.": 1, "I am not so old that I cannot fight!": 1, "I am not going to let that happen!": 1, "I am not going down there. It would be foolish to attempt it.": 1, "I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style.": 1, "I am not \"up to\" anything. I apologize if I have offended in any way.": 1, "I am more than happy to buy or sell whatever you might need.": 1, "I am likely the greatest wizard you will ever meet.": 1, "I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak...": 1, "I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the woman we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.": 1, "I am done with you. Go on, get out of my sight.": 1, "I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.": 1, "I am honored.": 1, "I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.": 1, "I am honored to be chosen.": 1, "I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on.": 1, "I am his mycologist. He may have grown Tel Mithryn by himself, but I nurture it.": 1, "I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.": 1, "I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.": 1, "I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.": 1, "I am grateful for your offer, outsider, but I am Skaal. All that I need, I was born with.": 1, "I am grateful for your interest in my goods.": 1, "I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.": 1, "I am glad to be free of those elves. I have never seen such greed and treachery in a creature before.": 1, "I am embarrassed to admit that it was my fault.": 1, "I am in no mood to talk, outsider. One of the Skaal has gone missing.": 1, "I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.": 1, "I am Majni, Alpha of the Frostmoon Pack. You are welcome here, so long as you respect our law.": 1, "I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold.": 1, "I ain't scared of nothin'.": 1, "I ain't much for talkin'.": 1, "I ain't lookin' to make friends.": 1, "I ain't in the mood to talk. Ohhhh...": 1, "I ain't done nothin'.": 1, "I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.": 1, "I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good.": 1, "I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.": 1, "I advise Igmund the same way I advised his father. Caution, caution, caution.": 1, "I admit, we are not making the progress I'd hoped. Perhaps you are right, this venture might be more trouble than it's worth.": 1, "I admit, there is strength in numbers. Perhaps between us...": 1, "I admit, it was quite a thrill to watch you vanquish that Dragon Priest.": 1, "I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy.": 1, "I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...": 1, "I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim.": 1, "I admit, I feel a bit frustrated that I can't be more helpful. Still, our enemy is likely just as much in the dark as we are, and that's something.": 1, "I admit, I do not entirely understand your sense of humor.": 1, "I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct.": 1, "I admire the Dwemer skill but it can get tiresome.": 1, "I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted.": 1, "I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.": 1, "I accept your yield.": 1, "I absolve you of your sins!": 1, "Hyah!": 1, "Huuuwa.": 1, "Huuuuwargh!": 1, "Huuuuwaaaa!": 1, "Huuragh!": 1, "I admit, I was not expecting to hear that.": 1, "I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!": 1, "I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.": 1, "I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting.": 1, "I am Knight-Paladin Gelebor. Welcome to the Great Chantry of Auri-El.": 1, "I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.": 1, "I am Jiub. Some call me Saint Jiub. Others call me Jiub the Eradicator. Perhaps you've heard of me?": 1, "I am Hermaeus Mora, the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown, master of fates. You stand in my realm, mortal.": 1, "I am Hermaeus Mora, Prince of Fate and Lord of Secrets. This is Apocrypha, where all knowledge is hoarded.": 1, "I am Harkon, lord of this court.": 1, "I am Frea of the Skaal. I am here to either save my people, or avenge them.": 1, "I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander.": 1, "I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.": 1, "I always wondered what the dwarves actually looked like. I hear they're like elves, but with beards.": 1, "I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself. ": 1, "I always thought that I would be a great hunter, or even the village chieftain.": 1, "I always preferred the liver myself. My brother had such a juicy liver.": 1, "I already did, but it won't do any good. They haven't had any for months.": 1, "I always leave room for the main course, Eola.": 1, "I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least.": 1, "I always dreamt of being a pack mule.": 1, "I also remind the Skaal to live as one with nature and to honor the will of the All-Maker, so that we'll be worthy to join him in death.": 1, "I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.": 1, "I also need to reassure Maven that it's business as usual without Mercer... and that a new Guild Master will soon be taking over.": 1, "I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work.": 1, "I also know that no one really believes that. I've been trying to avoid him, honestly.": 1, "I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.": 1, "I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.": 1, "I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?": 1, "I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.": 1, "I already told you, Mogrul can't touch me now.": 1, "I already told you, I'm not going back to Solstheim.": 1, "I always knew you were weak-minded, Sahrotaar.": 1, "Huu... kuuu...": 1, "I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.": 1, "I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.": 1, "I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.": 1, "I believe I was put here to protect this place from the darkness that pervades Solitude.": 1, "I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice.": 1, "I believe Galmar gave you something to do. So go do it.": 1, "I believe Councilor Morvayn wants to speak to you.": 1, "I began to explore what the dovah call \"Alok-Dilon,\" the ancient forbidden art that you call necromancy.": 1, "I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it.": 1, "I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!": 1, "A cave. Up for some hunting?": 1, "I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum. ": 1, "I beg of you: Please depart that blasted isle and return to Solitude at once!": 1, "I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.": 1, "I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice.": 1, "I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.": 1, "I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded.": 1, "I await your orders, Thane.": 1, "I await your command, Thane.": 1, "I await your answer.": 1, "I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.": 1, "I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.": 1, "I assure you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all mortals can withstand my embrace.": 1, "I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you.": 1, "I assure you, if I could convince Adril to do that, I'd be on the next ship back to Blacklight.": 1, "I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.": 1, "I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal.": 1, "I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet.": 1, "I assure you that we mean you no harm.": 1, "I assure you that I shall be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.": 1, "I barely make enough for us to eat as it is, father. You can't just drink it all away.": 1, "I assumed you were here to see me about your face. To have it sculpted into something more... artful than Nature has bestowed upon you.": 1, "I believe I've made myself rather clear.": 1, "I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.": 1, "I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.": 1, "I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.": 1, "I bet my papa could beat you up.": 1, "I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.": 1, "I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.": 1, "I believe you, Vigilant. And I don't think you even know what you've found here.": 1, "I believe you owe the Guild something.": 1, "I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?": 1, "I believe you have a delivery to make.": 1, "I believe we're done.": 1, "I believe we can prolong its salutary effects if we infuse it with potent vampiric blood.": 1, "I believe these pillars will activate the pumps for this room, assuming they still work.": 1, "I believe there's more to it than that.": 1, "I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.": 1, "I believe the secret to unraveling that prophecy is written in Serana's Elder Scroll.": 1, "I believe the Legate gave you an order. I expect you to follow it. Dismissed.": 1, "I believe that time is now. If I am wrong, may my ancestors forgive me.": 1, "I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found. ": 1, "I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord.": 1, "I believe she would want it placed upon her tombstone in Falkreath, as a symbol of her undying love and the great sacrifice she made for it.": 1, "I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.": 1, "I believe it was the ancient ancestors of the Skaal who built this tomb for their master, the Dragon Priest they called the guardian.": 1, "I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.": 1, "I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.": 1, "I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.": 1, "I believe in civility among seasoned warriors, and I find your ear worthy of my words.": 1, "I believe if the shrine can be destroyed, the Skaal will be free once more.": 1, "I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.": 1, "I believe the Legate gave you an order. Why are you standing around here flapping your jaw? Move out!": 1, "I am proud of all of you. ": 1, "I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought...": 1, "I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here. ": 1, "I am your better half. And your better half is telling you to stop being an idiot and serve the customers their drinks!": 1, "I am wise woman to this stronghold.": 1, "I am well, sire.": 1, "I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns.": 1, "I am weary of living in this village. I want to do something with my life other than farm, fish and hunt deer.": 1, "I am waiting for a good death.": 1, "I am unsure. Something has taken control of most of the people of Solstheim.": 1, "I am unsure. It may mean that you could save us, or it may mean that you could bring about our destruction.": 1, "I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me.": 1, "I am truly in your debt, my friend. I did not think the elves would keep me alive for much longer.": 1, "I am their master!": 1, "I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest.": 1, "I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule.": 1, "I am yours to command.": 1, "I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.": 1, "I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been.": 1, "I am the Ebony Warrior!": 1, "I am that which you have been seeking.": 1, "I am sure Nazir's cooking is great and all, but my appetites are a little more... discerning. ": 1, "I am sorry, but you left me with no choice.": 1, "I am sorry, but my duty is to my people right now.": 1, "I am sorry, but I must refuse. I am grateful for your help, but my place is here, with my people.": 1, "I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won.": 1, "I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part.": 1, "I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results.": 1, "I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.": 1, "I am ready for whatever the foul master of this book has in store for me.": 1, "I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.": 1, "I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me.": 1, "I assume that the Arch-Curate was corrupted by them when they found a way to breach the Inner Sanctum.": 1, "I am yours, Listener.": 1, "I am yours, mistress.": 1, "I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.": 1, "I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me.": 1, "I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.": 1, "I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.": 1, "I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.": 1, "I asked her about him many times, but she seemed angry and refused to speak about him, so eventually I let it go.": 1, "I ask only for a little charity.": 1, "I appreciate your problems, Adril, but I can't be expected to run a temple with those... things running around in there.": 1, "I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill.": 1, "I appreciate your concern for me, but Serana is all that I care about. You must keep her safe at all costs.": 1, "I appreciate the thought though.": 1, "I appreciate the help you've been giving us.": 1, "I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger.": 1, "I am yours, master.": 1, "I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist.": 1, "I applaud anyone who assists the court.": 1, "I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.": 1, "I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.": 1, "I answer the call of the Dragonborn.": 1, "I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.": 1, "I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived.": 1, "I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics.": 1, "I am. Here you go.": 1, "I am. Have you reconsidered?": 1, "I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform. ": 1, "I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days.": 1, "I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb.": 1, "A challenger is near...": 1, "I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy.": 1, "How I hate that title... damn fool's going to get himself killed over it someday.": 1, "Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.": 1, "Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.": 1, "How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.": 1, "How do you think? It's a blessing.": 1, "How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.": 1, "How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?": 1, "How do you think the crops are coming, dear?": 1, "How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?": 1, "How do you put up with that fop Fihada?": 1, "How do you manage to hold your ground like that?": 1, "How do you know this?": 1, "How do you know of me?": 1, "How do you feel? I think you might be sick. ": 1, "How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?": 1, "How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!": 1, "How does anyone expect me to write my opus with all of these rude interruptions?": 1, "How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!": 1, "How do we do that?": 1, "How disappointing.": 1, "How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters.": 1, "How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further.": 1, "How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself.": 1, "How did you manage to cripple yourself, Degaine?": 1, "How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!": 1, "How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know.": 1, "How did you do that?": 1, "How did you do it?": 1, "How did things go out there? Where is Bujold?": 1, "How did she die?": 1, "How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!": 1, "How do we get inside? We have to talk.": 1, "How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of Auri-El, girl. I had the ears of a god!": 1, "How does anyone know there was a city of Winterhold? M'aiq did not see it with his eyes. Did you?": 1, "How goes it, son?": 1, "How may I serve the Listener?": 1, "How may I help you, my son?": 1, "How may I help you, my daughter?": 1, "How many of you are there?!": 1, "How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.": 1, "How many is that today? ": 1, "How many did we lose this time?": 1, "How many Nords died to save the Empire? And what was our reward?": 1, "How long would they have to do that?": 1, "How long have you run this place, again?": 1, "How long do you think you can hide?": 1, "How long can we keep this up?": 1, "How long are you going to wait?": 1, "How does it feel to hold the fate of the vampire in your grasp. Exhilarating, isn't it?": 1, "How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?": 1, "How is your hunting with Yatul?": 1, "How is the work coming along?": 1, "How in the world did that happen?": 1, "How in the name of Zenithar was I to know the ingredients were phony? Do I look like someone that would double-cross a necromancer?": 1, "How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?": 1, "How have things been with you?": 1, "How hard would it be to feed a few extra mouths? I'm sure they can manage, and not leave us sitting out here like cattle.": 1, "How goes your hunt?": 1, "How goes the trade in and out of the city? ": 1, "How goes the hunting, sister?": 1, "How goes the hunting, brother? ": 1, "How goes the hunt?": 1, "How goes the begging today, Brenuin?": 1, "How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely.": 1, "How much deeper can this be? I had been told that Miraak's power was great, but to have built so large a temple...": 1, "How dare you! You disgusting pig!": 1, "How dare you! After all we've been through together? How can you do this to me!": 1, "How are you supposed to live when your only means of trade is yanked out from under you?": 1, "How are you holding up?": 1, "How are you feeling, Vex?": 1, "How are you feeling, Jarl Idgrod?": 1, "How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?": 1, "How are things at the Meadery, my dear?": 1, "How are the young ones coming along?": 1, "How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?": 1, "How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more.": 1, "How are the little ones?": 1, "How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?": 1, "How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.": 1, "How amazing! A real Dragon Priest! In all my years as a historian, I never thought I'd see anything like that.": 1, "How are you today, Thaena?": 1, "How am I supposed to get anything done with part of the tower withered like this?": 1, "How about you pay for your habit like everybody else. We're not running a charity here.": 1, "How about you keep serving the drinks, and I'll decide what's right for her!": 1, "How about some vampire dust? Bring me some of that and I'll pay handsomely.": 1, "How about some armor?": 1, "How about sitting in your home, minding your own business and then suddenly getting attacked by a dremora and his cronies.": 1, "How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften.": 1, "How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.": 1, "How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up.": 1, "How about a hundred Dunmer armed to the teeth?": 1, "How about a drink for the hero who cleared Fort Frostmoth!": 1, "How about I trade you a song for some fruit?": 1, "How about I just settle for some mazte and we'll forget I mentioned it.": 1, "How about I don't. You don't scare me.": 1, "How about... we play tag! You're it!": 1, "How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from that fanatic you call a father!": 1, "How are you, Drevis?": 1, "How are your chores coming, son?": 1, "How dare you trespass here!": 1, "How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?": 1, "How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!": 1, "How dare you set foot in here, after being infected by those foul beasts?": 1, "How dare you profane this place!": 1, "How dare you invade our territory!": 1, "How dare you invade my fort!": 1, "How dare you disobey me!": 1, "How could you just leave me here?": 1, "How could they live like this? It's disgusting.": 1, "How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.": 1, "How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.": 1, "How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.": 1, "How are your chores coming, my son?": 1, "How can you just sit here and wait? We should be in there!": 1, "How can we?

It's freezing!": 1, "How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?": 1, "How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible.

Doing better than we are I would guess.": 1, "How are your lessons coming, Talvas?": 1, "How are your friends?": 1, "How are your ears, Talvas?": 1, "How can you have Dunmer blood in your veins and have no knowledge of Blacklight?": 1, "Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak.": 1, "How much do I owe you this time?": 1, "How much do you know about the brewing of mead?": 1, "Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.": 1, "Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.": 1, "Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.": 1, "Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?": 1, "Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself.": 1, "Huh? Don't do that!": 1, "Huh... what was that? What'd you do?": 1, "Huh. Okay. We'll test your mettle another day.": 1, "Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself.": 1, "Huh. I feel better now.": 1, "Huh. Heard you broke out of Cidhna Mine with those Forsworn. Do you have any idea how many died?": 1, "Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.": 1, "Hufwah!": 1, "Humble Cicero lives to serve.": 1, "Huf!": 1, "Hsss...Hsss": 1, "Hsss...": 1, "Hrothmund was a great man, but he wasn't a god or a paragon. We're alive, he's not, and we'll look to ourselves for strength.": 1, "Hrothmund knows strength, in this world and the next. ": 1, "Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.": 1, "Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here?": 1, "Hrongar won't give us a straight answer.": 1, "Hrongar will know my meaning.": 1, "Hrongar carries on the policies of his brother and refuses to acknowledge the Legions right to garrison troops in his city.": 1, "Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered.": 1, "Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.": 1, "Hroggar doesn't have to know if we sit together. Or drink together. I doubt he would even care.": 1, "Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.": 1, "Hssssssss!": 1, "Hroar's crying is keeping me up at night. I'll give you one chance to talk the tears out of him, or he's getting the belt.": 1, "Humph. Some daughter you are.": 1, "Humph.

This one's mine.": 1, "How's business today, Fethis?": 1, "How's about a drink, Hod.": 1, "How'd I do?": 1, "How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.": 1, "How would you like a drink?": 1, "How would you feel about turning them over to me?": 1, "How wonderful.

It's the big room with the double bed.": 1, "Have it your way. It isn't worth it. There are easier ways to make money.": 1, "Haming, you need to get over here. Now!": 1, "A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had.": 1, "Hah! A girl running a bar? Don't be ridiculous, Minette!": 1, "Hagraven up ahead. Pull the lever when you're ready and we'll take her.": 1, "Hagraven or horker, it matters not. We've got the arrows to fell any game.": 1, "Haggling with you can be so...entertaining.": 1, "Hagajawala!": 1, "Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps it's best I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good day!": 1, "Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat.": 1, "Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!": 1, "Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other.": 1, "Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time.": 1, "Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.": 1, "Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...": 1, "Hadvar? How do you know him?": 1, "Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?": 1, "Hadvar... get away from there!": 1, "Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?": 1, "Hadvar's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good soldier. ": 1, "Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat.": 1, "Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!": 1, "Hadring got himself another customer, eh?": 1, "Had we only left a day earlier... she'd still be with us. It's my fault she's dead.": 1, "Had only Mara saved that poor animal...": 1, "Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King.": 1, "A few decades ago, this place was as busy as the Imperial City. Now, you're lucky if you don't trip over a skeever instead.": 1, "A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?": 1, "Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?": 1, "Ha. Those two deserved what they got. Their arrogance had become insufferable.": 1, "Ha. Sure you did. Dagur put you up to this?": 1, "Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen...": 1, "Haming, get over here!": 1, "Hah! Not if Fanari has anything to say about it.": 1, "Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one.": 1, "Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.": 1, "Halt, vampire!": 1, "Halt, outlander!": 1, "Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once.": 1, "Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.": 1, "Halt in the name of the Jarl!": 1, "Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.": 1, "Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!": 1, "Half the people in your little crew would just as soon kill me as talk to me. ": 1, "Half the pages, eh? You're getting there.": 1, "Half the field? What could need half the field?": 1, "Half the bloody town joined his side. Can you believe that?": 1, "Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already.": 1, "Hah! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it.": 1, "Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.": 1, "Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic. ": 1, "Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately.": 1, "Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!": 1, "Hail, thuri. Your thu'um has the mastery. Climb aboard and I will carry you to Miraak.": 1, "Hail, thuri. Shall we fly together?": 1, "Hail, sister! I am Rakel, of the Frostmoon Pack.": 1, "Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day.": 1, "Hail, brother! I am Rakel, of the Frostmoon Pack.": 1, "Hail, Ilfhild.": 1, "Hail, Gjalund.": 1, "Hail, Galmar.": 1, "Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then.": 1, "A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers.": 1, "Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates.": 1, "Ha. Nothing can destroy an Elder Scroll. Worry more about protecting your hide, and let me worry about my things.": 1, "Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!": 1, "Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.": 1, "Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them.": 1, "Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter.": 1, "Have you tried to walk on the plates without stepping on the same one twice?": 1, "Have you tried to Shout?": 1, "Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.": 1, "Have you tried any of the mead I brought out of storage? It still tastes all right to me, but...": 1, "Have you thought about my invitation?": 1, "Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.": 1, "Have you talked to Isran?": 1, "Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know.": 1, "Have you taken leave of your senses? We could be exposed... ruined. Ten years of planning all for nothing!": 1, "Have you taken care of that... little problem?": 1, "A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.": 1, "Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?": 1, "Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!": 1, "Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.": 1, "Have you seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there.": 1, "Have you seen the poor girl? She's a mess.": 1, "Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years.": 1, "Have you seen one in your travels?": 1, "Have you seen it?": 1, "Have you seen Varona? I'm hungry.": 1, "Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back.": 1, "Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway.": 1, "Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?": 1, "Have you seen Astrid? She needs to speak with you. It seemed urgent. Come talk to me afterward.": 1, "Have you scried anything new in the entrails?": 1, "Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?": 1, "Have you spoken to Fastred yet?": 1, "Have you reconsidered my idea?": 1, "Have you... gone... completely... mad?": 1, "Have you? The actual Oghma Infinium? That's... I've searched for it myself for many years without success...": 1, "He arrived alone, but spread enough coin around to start changing people's minds.": 1, "A feral-blooded has holed up with a group of necromancers. Likely wants to create a nest of broodlings.": 1, "He also is searching for them. In fact, he has already found one. He showed it to me when he came here.": 1, "He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic. ": 1, "Having trouble finding those ingredients?": 1, "Having past ties to the Empire immediately turned them into the scapegoat for the Dunmer people's suffering.": 1, "Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.": 1, "Haven't you talked to Astrid? She's by the pool, greeting the Night Mother and her little jester. She has a contract for you. Come see me afterward.": 1, "Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange. ": 1, "Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?": 1, "Haven't you heard that the Hall of the Vigilants was destroyed by vampires? They never took the threat seriously, and now they've paid the price.": 1, "Haven't you heard it by now?": 1, "Haven't you got something better to do?": 1, "Have you? All good, I trust. But you have me at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you...": 1, "Haven't you been listening to me? All the old tales agree that he has some means to travel to Sovngarde itself.": 1, "Haven't sold much.": 1, "Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.": 1, "Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!": 1, "Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!": 1, "Haven't seen him around before.": 1, "Haven't seen her around before.": 1, "Haven't heard from him in a long while. ": 1, "A fever must have taken me. What else could explain this?": 1, "Haven't heard anything lately, but check back with me... you never know.": 1, "Haven't fought like that in years.": 1, "Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.": 1, "Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?": 1, "Have yourself a great day!": 1, "Haven't up until now.": 1, "Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful.": 1, "Have you put those thieving bandits to the sword?": 1, "Have you not heard that ancient verse?": 1, "Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.": 1, "Have you ever seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea.": 1, "Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?": 1, "Have you ever heard of a Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?": 1, "Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.": 1, "Have you destroyed the Ash Guardian yet? Master Neloth will kill me... or worse... if he finds out!": 1, "Have you decided? I am not a patient man.": 1, "Have you decided to pay the visitor's tax?": 1, "Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?": 1, "Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet?

I could really use some tea.": 1, "Have you been working on your concentration?": 1, "Have you been paying attention to everything that's happened? He'll betray us the second our backs are turned.": 1, "Have you been listening to me? Like Serana, I'm a pure-blooded vampire. My presence on Tamriel is as much of a danger as hers.": 1, "Have you been listening to me? I'm not going back there.": 1, "Have you been learning your ores?": 1, "Have you been by Thirsk? Have you seen... is there any of the mead left?": 1, "Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough.": 1, "Have you always been that ugly?": 1, "Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?": 1, "Have we? ": 1, "Have to say, I'm pretty impressed.": 1, "Have to say, I'm glad that's over.": 1, "Have to admit, I'm attached to the place.

It's obvious my father's well beyond reason.": 1, "Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?": 1, "Have you found out anything about Alva?": 1, "Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen.": 1, "Have you not heard of me?

Well don't bother, he's a drunk.": 1, "Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach.": 1, "Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl.": 1, "Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.": 1, "Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.": 1, "Have you met Torom? He's the best dog in the Reach.": 1, "Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now.": 1, "Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town.": 1, "Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.": 1, "Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?": 1, "Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?": 1, "Have you found the source of the attacks?": 1, "Have you made up your mind?": 1, "Have you lost your mind?": 1, "Have you lost all sense? We are short on guards as it is!": 1, "Have you learned nothing from us?

I have dealings with everyone.": 1, "Have you killed them all yet?": 1, "Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal?

Please welcome our newest Bard!": 1, "Ha. Isran's going to like you. He's up the hill in the fort. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.": 1, "Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.": 1, "Great.": 1, "Great, with the two of us this should be easy.": 1, "Great, back to the fight.": 1, "Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?": 1, "Great! Thanks! Bastard stole from me. I'll catch him though!": 1, "Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way.": 1, "Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.": 1, "Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.": 1, "Great gift of blood you've given me. Blood that boils in my veins. Gives me strength.": 1, "Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need...": 1, "Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.": 1, "Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?": 1, "Gratian kept a journal of notes about his discoveries. If you can find his... remains, I'm hoping it will help.": 1, "Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.": 1, "Gratian Caerellius. He spent his entire life exploring ancient ruins across Tamriel and he died in these very mines almost 200 years ago.": 1, "Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.": 1, "Grandson. He's a strong lad. His parents were at Helgen when, well you know.": 1, "Gralnach! I told you not to go through your father's things!": 1, "Grah Dun!": 1, "Gracious! This one is certainly unaccustomed to such sights...": 1, "Grace of Kynareth be with you.": 1, "Grab what you can, and let's go.": 1, "Grab my journal, would you? We're going to need it.": 1, "Grab everything important and let's move! Dragon's burning everything to the ground!": 1, "Grab anything useful and let's go.": 1, "Grab Gunjar's gear. No shame in borrowing a friend's axe.": 1, "Graaah! I'll get you!": 1, "Gourmet? Why I... Um...  ": 1, "Gratian Caerellius.": 1, "Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...": 1, "Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.": 1, "Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it.": 1, "Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.": 1, "Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!": 1, "Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that...": 1, "Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?": 1, "Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole.": 1, "Grelod runs this orphanage because she's old, and set in her ways, and doesn't know any other life. These children need love, and comfort. I try...": 1, "Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.": 1, "Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.": 1, "A few septims ain't nothing.

Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.": 1, "Greetings. Welcome to the College of Winterhold.": 1, "Greetings, sister.": 1, "Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.": 1, "Greetings, mother. ": 1, "Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen.": 1, "Greetings, master. What do you need?": 1, "Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?": 1, "Greetings, brother.": 1, "Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.": 1, "Greetings, blood-kin.": 1, "A few years ago, I was out on patrol with two other men when we were attacked by some ash spawn.": 1, "Greetings, Listener!": 1, "Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me.

We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise.": 1, "Gotta give the crowd a show.": 1, "Got to be here somewhere...": 1, "Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own.

Good for you.": 1, "Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.": 1, "Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...": 1, "Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age.": 1, "Goora! Goora! Goora!": 1, "Goodness, no!": 1, "Goodness, it must have been quite difficult tracking those creatures down out there.": 1, "Goodbye. Be careful if you head into the ruins.": 1, "Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him...": 1, "Goodbye.": 1, "Goodbye, whelp.": 1, "Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it.": 1, "Goodbye, then.": 1, "Goodbye, ma'am.": 1, "Goodbye, hero! Take good care of Arvak for me! Such a good horse...": 1, "Goodbye, assassin.": 1, "Goodbye, Karliah.": 1, "Goodbye then.": 1, "Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.": 1, "Good. You're clearly better suited than I am to carry out such a menial task.": 1, "Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.": 1, "Good. You deserve that much.": 1, "Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you.": 1, "Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the blood magic.": 1, "Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells.": 1, "A final warning... be wary, for you can only hold your Vampire Lord form for a brief time.": 1, "Goodbye, sir.": 1, "Gotta admit, that's impressive.": 1, "Got a witchhunter in town, from the Priesthood of Stendarr. Keeps asking questions about that old abandoned house.": 1, "Got any ale or mead?": 1, "Got to be a sword or two in one of these chests. Look around.": 1, "Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting.": 1, "Got to admire the chops it takes to walk around like that.": 1, "Got this from a pretty excited looking dark elf around Raven Rock.

Go talk to him at Fort Dawnguard, southeast of Riften. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.": 1, "Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!": 1, "Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life.": 1, "Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?": 1, "Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.": 1, "A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.": 1, "Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise?": 1, "Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!": 1, "Ha! Like the bite of a flea!": 1, "Ha! I've suffered worse during training!": 1, "Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death.": 1, "Ha! I'll see to it the Jarl hears of your abuse of a court scholar. Shame on you.": 1, "Ha! I'd sooner bend my knee to Ulfric Stormcloak.": 1, "Ha! I thought as much.": 1, "Ha! I think you're bleeding!": 1, "Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the trouble.": 1, "Ha! Remarkable! Well, the old bastard certainly made it worth your while, didn't he?": 1, "Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!": 1, "Ha! I guess they fled.": 1, "Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting.": 1, "Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.": 1, "Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?": 1, "Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway.": 1, "Ha! Clearly, we should have killed that old bastard years ago!": 1, "Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you.": 1, "Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.": 1, "Ha! And neither are you, eh? Good to see another Redguard. I like to think we bring a little heat to this frozen wasteland.": 1, "Ha! All right, I'm writing that in. I'm not sure about the court but I find that much more probable than Olaf capturing a dragon.": 1, "Ha! About time we got some more muscle in this city.": 1, "Ha ha. They seem quite taken to you now that you're carrying some of the tree bark.": 1, "Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling on the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "Ha! I knew it was you all along.": 1, "Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!": 1, "Ha! So you did.": 1, "Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!": 1, "Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found.": 1, "Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.": 1, "Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.": 1, "Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong.": 1, "Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits! ": 1, "Ha, ha, ha! Not on your life!": 1, "Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?": 1, "Ha, I knew it! Gratian's death wasn't because of a rockfall, it was just a story to keep people away from the tombs.": 1, "Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay.": 1, "Ha! You're pathetic!": 1, "Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!": 1, "Ha! You can't resist, can you?": 1, "Ha! Wonderful!": 1, "Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.": 1, "Ha! Why you are, silly! You are the Listener! You are the Listener! Such a kidder...": 1, "Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way.": 1, "Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it.": 1, "Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started.": 1, "A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.": 1, "Ha! Wait...": 1, "Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.": 1, "Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true...": 1, "Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!": 1, "A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city.": 1, "Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!": 1, "Ha! That's my girl.": 1, "Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here.": 1, "Ha! That ain't nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for next week.": 1, "Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica.": 1, "Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.": 1, "Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!": 1, "Ha ha! I've suffered worse!": 1, "Guh!": 1, "Guess we'll have two more mouths to feed for a while.": 1, "Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well...": 1, "Guess they deserved it...": 1, "Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose.": 1, "Guess it was nothing.": 1, "Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch.": 1, "Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.": 1, "Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!": 1, "Guards, get the townspeople to safety!": 1, "Guards! Kill him!": 1, "Guards! Kill her!": 1, "Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it.": 1, "Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me.": 1, "Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.": 1, "Guards are free to search your room. Uh, just keep that in mind.": 1, "Guard. Prepare the prisoner.": 1, "Guard! My fine's been paid, now set me free!": 1, "Grrrarrggh!": 1, "Grrragh!": 1, "Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with.": 1, "Grrr!": 1, "A few people in the Warrens used to work here. Degaine broke some bones a while back. Eltrys quit. Cairine is too sick.": 1, "Grraaagghh!": 1, "Grr... I'm gonna get you for that!": 1, "Grow back that missing limb!": 1, "Groom her, too?": 1, "Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.": 1, "Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!": 1, "Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn.": 1, "Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.": 1, "Ha ha! I love a challenge!": 1, "Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.": 1, "Ha ha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Think again!": 1, "Ha ha! Are you kidding me? I've got the entire Thieves Guild at my back. What've you got?": 1, "Ha ha ha. Here you are.": 1, "Ha ha ha! No more! What a fool.": 1, "Ha ha ha! I knew I'd find you.": 1, "A few months ago, I had sent an important folio to the First Edition Bookshop in the Imperial City to be rebound.": 1, "Ha ha ha! Gods, that's rich. Work for Neloth. Ha ha ha!": 1, "Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!": 1, "Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father.": 1, "Ha ha ha ha! No! Never find me!": 1, "Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy.": 1, "Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.": 1, "Ha ha ha ha!": 1, "A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.": 1, "Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!": 1, "A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living.": 1, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!": 1, "Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.": 1, "Guuh!": 1, "Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join the defense.": 1, "Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready for use.": 1, "Gunmar, do you think I could borrow a troll?": 1, "Gunmar and I have a lot of work to do here, so we were hoping that maybe you could track him down.": 1, "Gunmar and I agree that we're going to need Florentius to help.": 1, "Gunjar isn't coming back from the dead. Take his armor and anything else on him.": 1, "Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.": 1, "Ha ha ha ha ha.": 1, "Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel.": 1, "He brought a group of true warriors away from the soft life of the Skaal, to know the wilderness, to feel the sting of cold and of steel.": 1, "He calls out in his sleep sometimes. I've heard Falion's name. What does it mean?": 1, "Hello again, friend. I'll never forget what you did for me.": 1, "Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?": 1, "Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.": 1, "Helgen? Has something happened...?": 1, "Heh... wait, you're serious? This is the Redwater Den, purveyors of the best Skooma outside of Balmora.": 1, "Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders.": 1, "Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles.": 1, "Heh.": 1, "Heh, a Nord skull makes the best axe blade. 'bout all they're good for.": 1, "Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all.": 1, "Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it.": 1, "Heart stones are only found on Solstheim, as far as I know.": 1, "Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn...": 1, "Hello again.": 1, "A dragon? In Helgen? It can't be... although...": 1, "Heard they'd go on midnight raids, pillaging and looting, and then stash the spoils somewhere, guarded by their sigil.": 1, "Heard that Reiklings got hold of Thirsk Mead Hall. Forced the Nords who lived there to move to a camp nearby.": 1, "Heard of them? I've been captaining a crew for 'em well on nine years now. What's it to you?": 1, "Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?": 1, "Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?": 1, "Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them.": 1, "Hear now the second word of Soul Tearing: \"Vaaz\"- meaning to tear your enemy's soul from its living vessel.": 1, "Hear my prayer, son of Akatosh, and grant peace to these departed souls.": 1, "Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!": 1, "Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...": 1, "Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!": 1, "Healing spells always leave me light-headed...": 1, "Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...": 1, "Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.": 1, "Headed east? May want to give Tel Mithryn a wide berth. I don't like the looks of that place one bit.": 1, "Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?": 1, "Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?": 1, "Hello? Hello? Ah, I know you're listening.": 1, "Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.": 1, "Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.": 1, "Hello.": 1, "Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time.": 1, "Hello, tidbit.": 1, "Hello, my name is Oriella, the bard that you asked your steward to hire. I hope my music will be pleasing to you.": 1, "Hello, my friend? What can I do for you on such a fine day?": 1, "Hello, my friend. Come to visit the forge?": 1, "Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person.": 1, "Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?": 1, "Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you.": 1, "Hello, ladies! Is there anything a big strong man can do for you this fine day?": 1, "Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service.": 1, "Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?": 1, "Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?": 1, "Hello, friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?": 1, "Hello, dear husband. Have you brought more silver jewelry for me to sell?": 1, "Hello, child of Kynareth.": 1, "Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you.": 1, "Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?": 1, "Hello, Nirya.": 1, "Hello, Listener.": 1, "Hello, Lady Mjoll.": 1, "Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband.": 1, "Hello, Fralia dear.": 1, "Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road.": 1, "Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?": 1, "Hello, husband. You slept well?": 1, "Hello? You! Over here! Please, I need help!": 1, "Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.": 1, "Head over to the Retching Netch if the ash has your throat parched.": 1, "He's off doing research in Raven Rock. I think.": 1, "He's obsessed... insane. Everyone around him fears him as they would a rabid dog.": 1, "He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents.": 1, "He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them.": 1, "He's not here right now. I think he's in Raven Rock.": 1, "He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing! ": 1, "He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.": 1, "He's never going to stop you know. He'll keep sending thugs after you until either you pay him or kill him.": 1, "He's never been the same since my mother died. I don't think he ever wants me to feel the pain he suffers.": 1, "He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.": 1, "He's my cousin. Just give him another chance. Please.": 1, "He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.": 1, "He's lonely. What do you expect?": 1, "He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks.": 1, "He's just waiting for the shipments, Lisbet. He'll be back as soon as they come in.": 1, "He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that.": 1, "He's in grave danger, and yet he continues to place himself in harm's way.": 1, "He's holed up with a group of a necromancers.": 1, "He's holed up with a group of a bandits.": 1, "He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.": 1, "A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense.": 1, "He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes.": 1, "He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.": 1, "He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead.": 1, "He's deceiving you.": 1, "He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.": 1, "He's convinced himself that there's some sort of conspiracy involving the East Empire Company and the mine's closure.": 1, "He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet.": 1, "He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!": 1, "Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.": 1, "He's off fighting, Adara, with the Stormcloaks. He'll return when the war is over.": 1, "He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.": 1, "Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here.": 1, "Head on in and behave yourself.": 1, "Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them.": 1, "Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!": 1, "Head back to the mainland, wanderer. There's nothing here but misery.": 1, "He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment.": 1, "He... he tried to kill Margret. Right in front of me.": 1, "He... died a few days later. I've tried to make do since then, but... it's been hard. Real hard.": 1, "He... He gave me something just a little while ago.": 1, "He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much.": 1, "He's up there, on the balcony. Come on!": 1, "He's twice your age and only wants to marry into our family to use my contacts at the East Empire Company. No, I won't allow it.": 1, "He's twice her age and they barely know each other. You expect me to ignore them?": 1, "He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.": 1, "He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you.": 1, "He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.": 1, "He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar.": 1, "He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords.": 1, "He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.": 1, "He's the closest thing I've had to a brother, and we all owe him our lives. Am I to suddenly turn my back?": 1, "He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.": 1, "He's such a loyal beast. Here, I'll teach you how to call him to you.": 1, "He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful.": 1, "He's so afraid to talk to me he's sending you to do it? I should've expected as much.": 1, "He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is.": 1, "He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.": 1, "He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar.": 1, "He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded.": 1, "He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful.": 1, "He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal.": 1, "Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.": 1, "Help me out, milady. I haven't eaten in days.": 1, "Here's everything I have. Sorry there isn't more.": 1, "Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?": 1, "Here's another riddle. \"Stay your course. To idle is to die.\" Well, at least it's straightforward.": 1, "Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.": 1, "Here's a letter from the Jarl's steward. Looks like official business.": 1, "Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.": 1, "Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them.": 1, "Here's a bit more. Hope you're not drinking this stuff yourself.": 1, "Here you stand, talking to a still grieving widow. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.": 1, "Here you stand, talking to a married woman. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.": 1, "Here you reclaim.": 1, "A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.": 1, "Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.": 1, "Here's everything I have. The letter, the key. Please, do this for me so I can finally regain the respect that I've lost.": 1, "Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.": 1, "Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift.": 1, "Here you go, for your trouble.": 1, "Here you go, dear.": 1, "Here you are. So sorry about that.": 1, "Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them.": 1, "Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth.": 1, "Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.": 1, "Here we go, let's get the blood flowing again.": 1, "Here we go again.": 1, "Here we are. Ready to go in?": 1, "Here we are. Nchardak. The book we're after is right inside that dome.": 1, "Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing.": 1, "A dragon! I saw a dragon!": 1, "A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?": 1, "Here we are.": 1, "Here's for your trouble.": 1, "Here's something to consider, Mirabelle.": 1, "A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor.": 1, "Here's your share. Nicely done.": 1, "Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.": 1, "Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed.": 1, "Here's your payment. Well earned, as always.": 1, "Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!": 1, "Here's your payment.": 1, "Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.": 1, "Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall.": 1, "Here's your cut.": 1, "Here's your coin. Keep bringing me more, and I'll keep paying you for them.": 1, "Here's your armor, just make sure you put it to good use.": 1, "Here's where you need to go.": 1, "Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are.": 1, "Here's where I fell. Feels like ages ago.": 1, "Here's to friendship. A gift! If you don't like it, too bad.": 1, "Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.": 1, "Here's the sword. Tell Harrald to stop slaying walls and perhaps his blade will stay in better condition!": 1, "A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.": 1, "Here's the situation.": 1, "Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision.": 1, "Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.": 1, "Here's the name and location of the client.": 1, "Here's the location of the next set of Dwemer diagrams. Thanks!": 1, "Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.": 1, "A dragon in Dragonsreach. That's something I never saw coming.": 1, "Here's the gold I promised. Keep following the trail and there will be more in it for you.": 1, "Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better.": 1, "Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?": 1, "Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!": 1, "Here we are, in view of seeing the prophecy fulfilled. These are truly great times.": 1, "Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.": 1, "Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?": 1, "Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment.": 1, "Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me.": 1, "Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month. ": 1, "Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest.": 1, "Help... ? No, no! Look I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me.": 1, "Help, someone!": 1, "Help! Someone's being attacked!": 1, "Help! Somebody, help!": 1, "Help! Somebody!": 1, "Help! Please, help me!": 1, "Help! Murder!": 1, "Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.": 1, "Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.": 1, "A dragon?": 1, "Help yourself to whatever you like inside. I won't be using it anymore.": 1, "Help yourself to anything you need in my laboratory.": 1, "Help will arrive soon.": 1, "Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?": 1, "Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it.": 1, "Help us and you may earn a pardon.": 1, "Help tribe-kin.": 1, "Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr.": 1, "Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.": 1, "Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?": 1, "Help me! A vampire!": 1, "Help me!": 1, "Help me out, milord. I haven't eaten in days.": 1, "Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.": 1, "Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door.": 1, "Her blood will be mine!": 1, "Her lust for power was her undoing.": 1, "Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?": 1, "Here to mine?": 1, "Here to make me an offer, then? Very well, what do you have in mind?": 1, "Here to join the Dawnguard? Good.": 1, "Here to dig. That's all.": 1, "Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.": 1, "Here then is the knowledge you need, although you did not know you needed it.": 1, "Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.": 1, "Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?": 1, "Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different.": 1, "Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.": 1, "Here is the foul book that killed Storn. Take it away from here. Throw it into the sea. It is evil.": 1, "Here is the Book of Fate, discovered in a secret room in the Arcane University.": 1, "Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions.": 1, "Here in my temple.": 1, "Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!": 1, "Here do you toil.": 1, "Here comes another one!": 1, "Here are the cubes you left behind.": 1, "A dragon... here in Skyrim. What's this world coming to? First the war, now dragons... trouble loves company, they say...": 1, "Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.": 1, "Here I am. Human as ever.": 1, "Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about.": 1, "Her name was Valerica. She has been gone for so long now, I can only assume she has left this world, one way or another.": 1, "Her name is forge. Now be silent before she hears you and becomes angry.": 1, "Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.": 1, "Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out.": 1, "Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!": 1, "Here in my shrine.": 1, "He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home.": 1, "He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry.": 1, "He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice.": 1, "He knew nothing. He served his purpose by leading us to this place. Now it is up to us to bring Harkon the prize.": 1, "He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.": 1, "He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done.": 1, "He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.": 1, "He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.": 1, "A fellow Breton who went by the name Esmond Tyne showed up on my doorstep about a fortnight ago.": 1, "He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.": 1, "He just became absorbed... obsessed. It was kind of sick, actually.": 1, "He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse.": 1, "He is? I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Perhaps it's for the better.": 1, "He is... the Void.": 1, "He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim.": 1, "He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home.": 1, "He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.": 1, "He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood.": 1, "He is the God of Mercy. The patron of order and justice for all of Tamriel.": 1, "He is the Daedric Lord of the Orcs. The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.": 1, "He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim.": 1, "He is rather handsome though, isn't he?": 1, "He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return.": 1, "He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.": 1, "He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.": 1, "He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.": 1, "He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold \"Glamoril\", or the secret of life.": 1, "He is gone.": 1, "He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped.": 1, "He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!": 1, "He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible.": 1, "He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.": 1, "He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits.": 1, "He knows that. They all know that.": 1, "He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out.": 1, "He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby.": 1, "He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side.": 1, "He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.": 1, "He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs.": 1, "He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.": 1, "He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out.": 1, "He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...": 1, "He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has.": 1, "He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl.": 1, "He noticed the shadowmarks like you did, and I thought he was one of us.": 1, "He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention.": 1, "He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest.": 1, "He never felt the call of the All-Maker as I do. As we all should.": 1, "He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.": 1, "He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.": 1, "He must have been very convincing.": 1, "He must be here somewhere...": 1, "He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care.": 1, "He might not devour you whole.": 1, "He might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.": 1, "He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.": 1, "He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected.": 1, "He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her.": 1, "He made most of the arrangements himself, he just needed it transported from Morrowind. That's what I agreed to help with.": 1, "He looks so... sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.": 1, "He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him.": 1, "He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain.": 1, "He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one.": 1, "He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him.": 1, "He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.": 1, "He hears the underslake of blood dust!": 1, "He he. Thanks, papa.": 1, "He fought well though. Jeron and Bresoth were no match for him.": 1, "He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say.": 1, "He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.": 1, "He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.": 1, "He fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know.": 1, "He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know.": 1, "He expects us to drop our defenses and greet them with open arms... to dialogue with them rather than defend our homeland by spilling their blood.": 1, "He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.": 1, "He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it.": 1, "He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.": 1, "He doesn't deserve to speak!": 1, "He doesn't dare try to collect now that I'm Neloth's steward.": 1, "He died well.": 1, "He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?": 1, "He didn't want to hit the bar like the rest! Ha ha ha!": 1, "He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him.": 1, "He did? That's... I'm surprised. ": 1, "He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself.": 1, "He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer.": 1, "He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.": 1, "He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later.": 1, "He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot.": 1, "He claims to serve loyally, but he really covets the throne. He sees himself in charge someday.": 1, "He can help you. Go now, please, before you lose control of yourself.": 1, "He can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.": 1, "He came to us some time ago, asking about Black Books. I believe he knows a great deal about them. Perhaps too much.": 1, "He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me.": 1, "He came in here asking my father if he needed any odd jobs done. Seemed kind of desperate.": 1, "He didn't need to pick the lock.": 1, "He he. That'll teach the little loony.": 1, "He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease your kind, Elf. Do your people rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?": 1, "He gives other merchants a bad name.": 1, "He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching.": 1, "He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill.": 1, "He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...": 1, "He he he he he.": 1, "He he he he he he he. The real question is, \"Would someone pay to have me killed... again.\"": 1, "He he he he he he he he he he.": 1, "A feral-blooded has holed up with a group of bandits. Likely wants to create a nest of broodlings.": 1, "He has to be lying!": 1, "He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently.": 1, "He has some simple-minded courier delivering it?": 1, "He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing.": 1, "He has served me long and well. But he grows restless under my guidance.": 1, "He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?": 1, "He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.": 1, "He has returned to the All-Maker. He is at peace now, no matter what that evil thing may have done to his body.": 1, "He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality.": 1, "He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out.": 1, "He has neglected using it for ages. If he wants it filled now, then grander things are afoot. This is good.": 1, "He has knowledge of a cult of Talos. He will tell us what we need to know, or he will die. The choice is his. ": 1, "He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.": 1, "He has given up. But I have not.": 1, "He has confirmed that Miraak is indeed behind the suffering of our people.": 1, "He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too.": 1, "He had an insatiable bloodlust and was extremely stubborn... one of the toughest employers I've ever had.": 1, "He had a wild gleam in his eye, more than most.": 1, "He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.": 1, "He got to my target first and called the guard to cover his tracks. By the time I got there, the place was on alert.": 1, "He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.": 1, "He has quite a few friends on the Council back in Morrowind and they wanted to ensure his safety while he was here.": 1, "He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in.": 1, "He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay.": 1, "He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.": 1, "He'll tell you what a monster I am, that I can't be trusted... You mark my words, it's him you need to worry about.": 1, "He'll help you get around this wretched place, but I'm sure he'd be much happier someplace sunnier.": 1, "A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.": 1, "He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!": 1, "He'll do no such thing!": 1, "He'll cozy up to you, use his honeyed words to get you to lower your guard, then use you and throw you away when he's done with you.": 1, "He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying.": 1, "He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed. ": 1, "He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.": 1, "He would never have willingly parted with it. What a shame.": 1, "He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary.": 1, "He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.": 1, "He would ask that it please not happen again.": 1, "He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.": 1, "He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him.": 1, "He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?": 1, "He what? What are you talking about?": 1, "He what?": 1, "He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.": 1, "He wasn't protesting, Maven.": 1, "He wasn't always like that, though. There was... a turn. He stumbled onto this obscure prophecy and just kind of lost himself in it.": 1, "He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help.": 1, "He was told to run the scam on merchants, but he smelled the gold on you and his judgment went out the window.": 1, "He was the original shadowmage. His advances in magic are legendary.": 1, "He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.": 1, "He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men.": 1, "He was the first great Nord enchanter, maybe even the first human to master elven methods.": 1, "He was supposed to keep them under control.": 1, "He won't need either of us anymore.": 1, "He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.": 1, "He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill.": 1, "He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.": 1, "He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.": 1, "He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.": 1, "He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.": 1, "He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.": 1, "He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!": 1, "He's asked far, far too many questions about my research.": 1, "A dragon? That's... ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you boy?": 1, "He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans.": 1, "He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance.": 1, "He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.": 1, "He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed.": 1, "He's alive. I've seen him.": 1, "He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald.": 1, "He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.": 1, "He's a... powerful man. Or at least used to be.": 1, "He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire.": 1, "He's a true Nord. He'll come around.": 1, "He's a traitor, plain and simple. Had I been sitting on the throne, he'd be hanging from the gallows for his sympathies towards the Empire.": 1, "He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.": 1, "He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war.  I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.": 1, "He's a priest of Arkay. Well, he was. It's... it's complicated.": 1, "He's a lucky man to have such a beautiful young wife.": 1, "He's a little eccentric, but we can trust him and we could definitely use his skills.": 1, "He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.": 1, "He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!": 1, "He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.": 1, "He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.": 1, "He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire.": 1, "He's a very powerful man. Or he was at one point. I'm surprised another vampire hasn't heard of him.": 1, "He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?": 1, "He was rather straight forward with Torygg.": 1, "He was one of the smelter workers. I used to have a job down there myself, casting silver ingots.": 1, "He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation.": 1, "He stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there.": 1, "He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.": 1, "He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry.": 1, "He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.": 1, "He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege.": 1, "He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time.": 1, "He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop.": 1, "He set off from here so long ago, it's hard to say. Could be in Hammerfell for all I know.": 1, "He served the dragons before their fall from power, as most did. A priest in their order.": 1, "He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.": 1, "He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that. ": 1, "He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.": 1, "He takes after his father, and she takes after you.": 1, "He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different.": 1, "He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a \"proper Nord worker.\" My people are not slaves!": 1, "He said he'll meet you where you met for the first time. He said you'd know what it means.": 1, "He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it.": 1, "He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.": 1, "He said he loved me....": 1, "He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!": 1, "He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.": 1, "He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!": 1, "He said \"Gwilin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be.\"": 1, "He sacked Winterhold in dragon form, and bent their minds to blame Solitude.": 1, "He sacked Winterhold his only true ally, and used magic bold to blame Solitude.": 1, "He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.": 1, "He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex...": 1, "He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor.": 1, "He was out of control, Garan. It had to be done.": 1, "He tends the store, and I've got this stall.": 1, "A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.": 1, "He was one of my patrons, and liked to drink heavily, so I wasn't exactly surprised.": 1, "He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.": 1, "He was obsessed with power. She was obsessed with seeing him fail. It was just so... toxic.": 1, "He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn.": 1, "He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge.": 1, "He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.": 1, "He was an explorer for the East Empire Company. They'd send him all over Tamriel when they had difficulties in a mining operation.": 1, "He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him.": 1, "He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent.": 1, "He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you.": 1, "He was a strange Altmer... paid more attention to his research than his own well-being. He lived in the basement of an inn for goodness sakes!": 1, "He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue.": 1, "He was a great man and a good leader. I miss him dearly.": 1, "He told me all about it, but I can't seem to recall the details right now.": 1, "He was a great bear of a man, and a fearsome warrior. I used to be terrified of him when I was a little girl.": 1, "He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before.": 1, "He wants the city this badly, he can fight me for it.": 1, "He wanted me to take him out to Dragon Bridge, but I told him it ain't one of my stops.": 1, "He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.": 1, "He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.": 1, "He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.": 1, "He underestimated the Redoran Guard. They were organized and brought a swift end to the coup.": 1, "He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.": 1, "He tried to hire me for a trip to Dragon Bridge, but I told him that ain't one of my stops.": 1, "A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar. ": 1, "A fair question, my friend... a fair question.": 1, "He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!": 1, "He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came.": 1, "He was a good man. The strong center of the Skaal. If you know how to stop whatever that was, go and stop it.": 1, "Do not cross the bridge unaided!": 1, "Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear.": 1, "Do not break our concentration.": 1, "Anyway, take this for your time.": 1, "Anyway, my mother and I didn't feel like inviting a war with all of Tamriel, so we tried to stop him. That's why I was sealed away with the Scroll.": 1, "Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles.": 1, "Anyway, here is your reward.  Thanks again.": 1, "Anyway, he's dead and we're alive. It's time to begin a new tradition for Thirsk. And I'm going to do that.": 1, "Anyway, enough of that. Let's get started.": 1, "Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed.": 1, "Anyway, I'm quite happy in my current pursuits. So if you'll excuse me...": 1, "Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off.": 1, "Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things.": 1, "Anyway, I suppose you're looking for work. Well, I've got bad news. This place is dryer than a damn bone.": 1, "Anyway, I don't think he'd take on anyone that isn't a dunmer.": 1, "Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight.": 1, "Anyway, this is all very touching, but don't we have some more important things to worry about right now?": 1, "Anytime, friend.": 1, "Anything?": 1, "Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine.": 1, "Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him.": 1, "Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.": 1, "Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me.": 1, "Anything you say, Mother.": 1, "Anything you need, just holler.": 1, "Anything you can offer, please. I'm starving.": 1, "Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.": 1, "Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.": 1, "Anything you can contribute to Raven Rock will be greatly appreciated... and rewarded appropriately, of course.": 1, "Anything to report, Captain Veleth?": 1, "Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.": 1, "Anytime you want to head for Skyrim, I'm right with you. I've spent enough time on Solstheim to last a lifetime.": 1, "Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it.": 1, "Anyway, we should keep moving.": 1, "Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you.": 1, "Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan.": 1, "Are those two at it again?": 1, "Are those parts ready yet?": 1, "Are they gone?": 1, "Are there... people in your life?": 1, "Are the potatoes ready for eating? I want to roast them with some onions for the night's meal.": 1, "Are the gods angry with me? ": 1, "Are the ash yams growing like you expected this season?": 1, "Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?": 1, "Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the castle?": 1, "Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them.": 1, "Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?": 1, "Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand.": 1, "Anyway, we'd just cleared a ruined fort somewhere outside of Whiterun and when we got outside, we saw one of them galloping away on horseback.": 1, "Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon.": 1, "Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.": 1, "Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered.": 1, "Araloo! Araloo!": 1, "Arak!": 1, "Araaaaaa!": 1, "Apprentice blacksmith, at your service.": 1, "Apples, tomatoes, leeks and cabbages! Fresh and ripe!": 1, "Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon.": 1, "Apparently you had blood in your ears when I said not to draw attention to yourself. If I wanted a messy kill I would have said so.": 1, "Apparently time is more malleable if you're the Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.": 1, "Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.": 1, "Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client.": 1, "Apologies, Adril. In my experience it's usually the quietest before the storm.": 1, "Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.": 1, "Are we building it? I had a dream about that...": 1, "Anything good?": 1, "Anything for my favorite lass.": 1, "Any luck finding my pages yet?": 1, "Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.": 1, "Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.": 1, "Any ideas?": 1, "Any idea how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty big place.": 1, "Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?": 1, "Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.": 1, "Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.": 1, "Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening.": 1, "Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.": 1, "Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.": 1, "Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone...": 1, "Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk...": 1, "Any luck gathering those ingredients?": 1, "Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after.": 1, "Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true.": 1, "Anuriel, a word please.": 1, "Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.": 1, "Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that.": 1, "Another who seeks death.": 1, "Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job.": 1, "Another victory for the Redoran Guard.": 1, "Another victory for the Empire!": 1, "A werewolf? Here?": 1, "Another victim fell for our ruse!": 1, "Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man.": 1, "Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week. ": 1, "Another time, perhaps.": 1, "Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.": 1, "Anything good in there?": 1, "Any luck getting the marks from those men?": 1, "Any luck tracking down Esmond?": 1, "Anything else you want to say?": 1, "Anything else before you make the journey?": 1, "Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?": 1, "Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?": 1, "Anything I can do.": 1, "Anything I can do for you, I will.": 1, "Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.": 1, "Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things.": 1, "Anyone seen entering or leaving? Any strange lights or unusual noises?": 1, "Anyone see anything?": 1, "Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "Anyone else feel like running?": 1, "Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?": 1, "Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?": 1, "Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.": 1, "Any time Adril and the Redoran Guard made a move, the Ulens must have been one step ahead and didn't show up.": 1, "Any questions?": 1, "Any progress on finding the mask?": 1, "Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?": 1, "Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!": 1, "Any of the documented indications of Hermaeus Mora's permanent influence.": 1, "Any news?": 1, "Any news from Vvardenfell, Councilor?": 1, "Any my tea better be hot.": 1, "Any moment now, I'll find you...": 1, "Any luck?": 1, "Any luck yet?": 1, "Any luck with Sapphire?": 1, "Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going.": 1, "Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all.": 1, "Are we clear?": 1, "Are we done? I thought so.": 1, "Are you prepared, then, to help bring the light across this land?": 1, "Are you prepared to receive my golden words?": 1, "Are you prepared to make that commitment?": 1, "Are you prepared to die?": 1, "Are you prepared to deal with Ildari?": 1, "Are you prepared for your death?": 1, "Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?": 1, "Are you playing hide and seek?": 1, "Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history.": 1, "A war veteran should be respected.": 1, "Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.": 1, "Are you one of my father's little acolytes?": 1, "Are you on the hunt?": 1, "Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?": 1, "Are you okay? Almost thought I lost you there... you went white as the snow.": 1, "Are you nuts?": 1, "Are you now? You were at Helgen, one of the prisoners. Although no one seems to know how you got mixed up in that affair.": 1, "Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.": 1, "Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of adventure and romance?": 1, "Are you married? You look the type. Make sure you treat your wife with the respect she deserves.": 1, "Are you making good progress with the planting?": 1, "A warrior expects nothing, and therefore is ready for anything.": 1, "Are you mad, woman? After the trouble I've gone through?": 1, "Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.": 1, "Are you lost? ": 1, "Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.": 1, "Are you looking for help with something? This is a busy time.": 1, "Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?": 1, "Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself?": 1, "Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?": 1, "Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but...": 1, "Are you ready now?": 1, "Are you sure you aren't a stranger?": 1, "Are you sure this is the right way?": 1, "Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is...": 1, "Are you sure that's something you want? This isn't like picking out a new outfit. You'll be a creature of the night, like me.": 1, "Are you sure that was wise, Lokil? He still might have told us something.": 1, "Are you sure about this?": 1, "Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?": 1, "Are you still here?": 1, "Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.": 1, "Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.": 1, "Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast.": 1, "Are you serious? I say more threatening words to my husband.": 1, "Are you serious? I hear more threatening words from my wife.": 1, "Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?": 1, "Are you seeing this? It's fantastic!": 1, "Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then.": 1, "Are you really gonna adopt one of us?": 1, "Are you ready to test yourself at Fort Hraagstad?": 1, "Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?": 1, "Are you ready to pay me yet?": 1, "Are you ready to help me now? We should not delay.": 1, "Are you ready to go? I'm not entirely sure what this thing is going to do when I add my blood.": 1, "Are you ready to go?": 1, "Are you ready to go inside?": 1, "A war dog is good company and good protection.": 1, "Are you ready to give me the Star?": 1, "Are you ready to for Serpentstone Island?": 1, "Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?": 1, "Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die.": 1, "Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.": 1, "Are you listening?": 1, "Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.": 1, "Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable?": 1, "Are you asleep?": 1, "Are you alright? That looked painful.": 1, "Are you alright? Come on, we can do this. I know we can.": 1, "Are you alright, Ahlam? You haven't seemed yourself today.": 1, "Are you all right? You seem tired.": 1, "Are you all right? What happened in there?": 1, "Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!": 1, "Are you all right? Did you see what happened?": 1, "Are you all right? Can you walk?": 1, "Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago.": 1, "Are you all right, dear?": 1, "Are you all right, Gat?": 1, "Are you being serious? How... how did she take it?": 1, "Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days.": 1, "Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!": 1, "Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.": 1, "Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?": 1, "Are you a member of the College, or did you just steal those robes from a real wizard?": 1, "Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game.": 1, "Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood. ": 1, "Are we writing a letter, Lord?": 1, "Are we truly sure this is a good idea?": 1, "Are we running low on mead?": 1, "Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?": 1, "Are we ready then?": 1, "Are we off on the hunt again, soon?": 1, "Are we hunting soon?": 1, "Are you a stranger?": 1, "Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!": 1, "Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?": 1, "Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?": 1, "Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.": 1, "Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.": 1, "Are you kidding me? I fought off all those bandits. I'm not afraid of you.": 1, "Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!": 1, "Are you infected? Keep your distance from me.": 1, "Are you in some kind of trouble?": 1, "Are you hurt? What's happened?": 1, "Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?": 1, "Are you here to rescue me?": 1, "Are you here to pray, or perhaps pay your respects at our Ancestral Tomb?": 1, "Are you here to help?": 1, "Are you here adopt someone?": 1, "Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health.": 1, "Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt.": 1, "Are you going to walk over to father and start hitting him again?": 1, "Are you going to let me watch, or not?": 1, "Are you going to join us on the next hunt?": 1, "Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.": 1, "Are you going to Raven Rock soon? I need some thing.": 1, "Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward.": 1, "Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.": 1, "Are you feeling any stronger?": 1, "Are you feeling all right, dear? You look a little ill.": 1, "Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!": 1, "Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?": 1, "Are you enjoying the party?": 1, "Are you daft? This isn't the Dark Brotherhood! We don't go around murdering anyone, ever. It just isn't how things are done.": 1, "Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!": 1, "Are you going to see him? Do tell him \"hello\" for me, won't you?": 1, "Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.": 1, "Another thrall for the Void!": 1, "Another soul for you, Father!": 1, "A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.": 1, "And there is... no... Listener!": 1, "And there is the one who has freed us.": 1, "And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow.": 1, "And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you. ": 1, "And there haven't been any... problems?": 1, "And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk.": 1, "A woman? Trapped in there? That doesn't make any sense. Who is she? More importantly, where is she?": 1, "And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible.": 1, "And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works.": 1, "And then you get to the real danger. We can discuss that when the time comes. If it comes.": 1, "And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.": 1, "A wondrous blade... ahhh, never mind. Just take the darn thing.": 1, "And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!": 1, "And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything.": 1, "And then preyed on the Rift until finally someone put them down.": 1, "And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.": 1, "And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.": 1, "And their heretical artifacts grant powers to mortals that wreak havoc across Tamriel. They must be destroyed or guarded to prevent temptation.": 1, "A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.": 1, "And the third has something to do with fire. It also seems to mention scales.": 1, "A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her.": 1, "And the tea. The thrice damned tea! I don't think I'll ever learn to make it properly.": 1, "And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.": 1, "And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?": 1, "And the message, sir?": 1, "And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.": 1, "And the book's power comes from the same dark source as that which corrupted the Wind Stone.": 1, "And then realizing a troll with armor is even more intimidating.": 1, "And the blade?": 1, "And these men and women - they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you...": 1, "And they call me a savage. Least I don't leave my trash lying around...": 1, "And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?": 1, "And well it is that this has happened. But I have always watched, and know that it was your softness that lead to your own exile.": 1, "And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.": 1, "And we'll need to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.": 1, "And we will not return without it. Vingalmo and Orthjolf will make way for me after this.": 1, "A wise decision.": 1, "And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.": 1, "A witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr is in town. He's asking a lot of questions about that old abandoned house.": 1, "And we gave it to Erikur?": 1, "And we gave it to Elisif?": 1, "And unless I'm seeing things, you're starting to... glimmer.": 1, "And two, you follow my lead and do exactly as I say... no questions, no excuses.": 1, "And two, I'm not going anywhere near them.": 1, "And they always come to regret it.": 1, "And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die.": 1, "And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?": 1, "And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.": 1, "And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through.": 1, "And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested.": 1, "And those winds issue from my whispers.": 1, "And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.": 1, "And this... This is all wrong.": 1, "And this must be the Hall of Stories.": 1, "And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.": 1, "And they should enjoy it while they can... I suspect all of Tamriel will again be called to arms in the not too distant future.": 1, "And they say romance is dead.": 1, "And they have an Elder Scroll.": 1, "And they got the orders backwards. Ha ha ha.  Yes, I'm writing that in.  It should be good for a laugh from the court.": 1, "And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now.": 1, "And what did you say to that?": 1, "And the Whispering Lady.": 1, "And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now...": 1, "And so it begins...": 1, "And so here we are, out of our home.": 1, "And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.": 1, "And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time.": 1, "And so I'm going to give you a chance to get yourself cured.": 1, "And so I feel your shame all the more deeply. ": 1, "And so Alduin's lordship passes to you. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly submit to your mastery of the Thu'um.": 1, "And since the Dawnguard are still around, that must not have happened.": 1, "And promise me you'll keep my daughter safe. She's the only thing of value I have left.": 1, "And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us.": 1, "And please accept this gift from my personal armory.": 1, "And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself.": 1, "And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you.": 1, "And so it is done.": 1, "And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble.": 1, "And of course, they own Cidhna Mine, the finest prison and source of silver in Skyrim.": 1, "And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men.": 1, "And of course the symbol for \"Dragonborn.\" That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.": 1, "And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King. ": 1, "And now... now I can't rest. Not until I have proof. Something to show the world what I discovered, what I did. That my life... mattered.": 1, "And now... I think I can rest. Farewell, my friend, wherever your travels take you.": 1, "And now, with the constant eruptions of the Red Mountain, it's more important than ever.": 1, "And now, to deliver a speech.": 1, "And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner.": 1, "And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!": 1, "And now you've found me. Can I help you?": 1, "And now you're back. Great, just great.": 1, "And now you'll walk away, if you know what's good for you. ": 1, "And of course, we couldn't have done it without you.": 1, "And the Reclamations, they did nothing? Why did they allow the Tribunal to gain our people's favor at all?": 1, "And so the First Dragonborn meets the Last Dragonborn at the summit of Apocrypha.": 1, "And so you delivered her to them. ": 1, "And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose.": 1, "And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.": 1, "And that, my nervous little friend, has not happened. Would you care to comment on that, perhaps?": 1, "And that's why I'm the best.": 1, "And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim.": 1, "And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want. ": 1, "And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!": 1, "And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him. ": 1, "And that's as it should be. In the darkest days ahead, it'll be us Nords who lead the fight against the elves.": 1, "And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!": 1, "And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all.": 1, "And that was just one trap! Look around! Who knows what else this thing is capable of?": 1, "And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.": 1, "And so we've delivered her right to them. I should've kept her here until we were certain...": 1, "And thank you for your help. You're a good friend.": 1, "And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by.": 1, "And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.": 1, "And take this as well. Seeing as Saint Jiub has ascended to pure spiritual form, I won't need it any longer.": 1, "And suffered twice as much.": 1, "And speaking of spoiling Dorthe, who made her a new doll last week?": 1, "And so, you will die a heretic's death.": 1, "A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim. ": 1, "And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.": 1, "And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say?": 1, "And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called \"Dragonsreach.\"": 1, "And so you shall be tested.": 1, "And so you learn the power of the night.": 1, "And so you fulfilled your destiny, which you once said you did not believe in.": 1, "And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.": 1, "Another soul returns to the All-Maker.": 1, "And what do Legion soldiers know about the hills the Reach? And the caves that make up those hills? The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.": 1, "And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!": 1, "Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me.": 1, "Another adventure.": 1, "Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered.": 1, "Another Dark Elf. Just what Windhelm needs.": 1, "Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder.": 1, "Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.": 1, "And? Were they magnificent?": 1, "And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.": 1, "And... you'll take care of it?": 1, "And... what did she say?": 1, "And... here. I suppose you've earned these.": 1, "And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful.": 1, "And... don't tell Elmus I said that.": 1, "Another border...no, aetheric order. I think that's right. ": 1, "And... I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this - as payment, and a symbol of my affection.": 1, "And, while you're at it, make a little bit of coin on the side. Not a bad deal, eh?": 1, "And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften.": 1, "And, since you need secrets that only Hermaeus Mora knows, it seems like a rather foolish thing to do. But I'm sure you know best.": 1, "And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could.": 1, "And, as you told me once, the next world will have to take care of itself. Ful nii los. Even I cannot see past Time's ending.": 1, "And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.": 1, "And you... step forward.": 1, "And you...": 1, "And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time.": 1, "And you, go sit on that damn chair and start acting like a Jarl.": 1, "And you, Jorleif?": 1, "And you've proven that was the best move I could have made. Don't give me that look. You're free to go.": 1, "And you're worried about your shoes?": 1, "And...": 1, "And you're sure?": 1, "Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.": 1, "Another day in this graveyard.": 1, "Another soul for the master!": 1, "Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead....": 1, "Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf.": 1, "A what?": 1, "Another poem, I'll bet. He does know how to make a girl blush.": 1, "Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister.": 1, "Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother.": 1, "Another one of those things. Let's keep our distance.": 1, "Another one for the scrap heap of history.": 1, "Another one for the Blades.": 1, "Another offering for the Master.": 1, "Another note from your friend Ralis. I hope everything is all right.": 1, "Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.": 1, "Another cave. I've spent enough time underground, myself, but if you want to go in, I'm right behind you.": 1, "Another new Apprentice, I see.": 1, "Another letter from Ralis. He's starting to scare me a little.": 1, "Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed.": 1, "Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?": 1, "Another foul day at the smelter.": 1, "Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.": 1, "Another filthy cave. Always so dark.": 1, "Another elf, I see. I'm sure Vingalmo will be sizing you up as we speak, trying to figure if you're friend or foe.": 1, "Another drink, Cosnach? A porter with Arnleif and Sons deserves nothing but the finest here.": 1, "Another day, another victory.": 1, "Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn.": 1, "Another day, another septim.": 1, "Another day, another opportunity to learn!": 1, "Another day of misery...": 1, "Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.": 1, "And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!": 1, "And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned.": 1, "And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?": 1, "A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.": 1, "And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?": 1, "And who's this? One of your comrades?": 1, "And who is this?": 1, "And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords.": 1, "And while I do not know its exact whereabouts, I do have information suggesting someone who does.": 1, "A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore.": 1, "And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right.": 1, "And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.": 1, "And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea.": 1, "And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh? ": 1, "And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest.": 1, "And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.": 1, "And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.": 1, "And what? You couldn't read it yourself? Fine, give it here a moment.": 1, "And what's wrong with him, huh?": 1, "And what's this thing?": 1, "And what's that have to do with me?": 1, "And what would you have me do?": 1, "And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?": 1, "And what will you do when I'm gone?": 1, "And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?": 1, "And what might you be looking at?": 1, "And what might that be?": 1, "And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?": 1, "And what harm is there in letting a few legionnaires die in place of your own men?": 1, "And what happens when you've slain me? Is Valerica next? Is Serana?": 1, "And what exactly are you going to pay me with? Take a look around. Gold doesn't exactly win you any friends around here.": 1, "And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?": 1, "And you'll be trampled to death!": 1, "And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!": 1, "A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?": 1, "And you'd do well to be more careful of whom you engage in witty banter.": 1, "And you will sell them to me. I suppose I'll have to give you the map first?": 1, "And you want to put more logs on the fire?": 1, "And you thought I was just a pretty face.": 1, "And you think that I care? Interesting.": 1, "And you think I do? Humph.": 1, "And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!": 1, "And you haven't forgotten what you need to do, have you?": 1, "And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family.": 1, "And you didn't stop them? You didn't secure the scroll?": 1, "And you carried out my instructions to kill the victim in view of others and while wearing the Dawnguard uniform. Very good.": 1, "And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now.": 1, "And you are...?": 1, "And why would you be looking for me, hmm? I'm not sure I appreciate your presence here. Friend.": 1, "And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood. ": 1, "And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College.": 1, "A wise and foresighted policy, in the event.": 1, "And yet, as my mortal life neared an end, I faced a seemingly invincible enemy -- my own mortality.": 1, "And yet, I have fallen so low that I must justify myself to a wanderer in the sewers of this backwater of the world.": 1, "And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?": 1, "And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.": 1, "And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!": 1, "And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.": 1, "And without any regard for my safety, I fearless charged the enemy! No, much too dramatic...": 1, "And with that... it's done. No one could possibly deny what we've found now.": 1, "And with that, the tour is over. I thank you for your patronage, and I hope to see you again soon!": 1, "And with Solstheim crawling with reavers and Azura-knows what else, I can't risk any attacks on Raven Rock.": 1, "And why wouldn't I be? We sing tales of kings, queens and their politics, 'tis true. But do you know who really makes history?": 1, "And yet...": 1, "And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that it?": 1, "Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.": 1, "Are you sure? I'm willing to turn you, but you need to think it through.": 1, "Attention! General Tullius has an announcement!": 1, "Attendant, why has the door to the lower level been locked?": 1, "Attack!": 1, "Attack me again and I'll hunt you down!": 1, "Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said.": 1, "Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.": 1, "Ataf, please play back that piece for me.": 1, "Ataf keeps making eyes at me. ": 1, "At your service.": 1, "At worst, I have a few bruises to show for my ordeal.": 1, "At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city.": 1, "At times like this, history truly comes alive for me.": 1, "At this very moment? No. However...": 1, "Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!": 1, "At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic.": 1, "At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College.": 1, "At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place.": 1, "At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore.": 1, "At this rate, my first volume will be complete. Don't give up.": 1, "At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?": 1, "At this rate, I'll be able to put a roof over my head in just a few months.": 1, "At this rate that'll never happen.": 1, "At their bases, the barrier's energy is being drawn from unfortunate souls that have been exiled here.": 1, "At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market.": 1, "At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs.": 1, "At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger.": 1, "At the market, father.": 1, "At the end of the day, every warrior is alone.": 1, "At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence. ": 1, "At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall.": 1, "Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home.": 1, "Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?": 1, "A true killer, like me. The gods put us here to fill their halls with souls. You'll fit in fine down here.": 1, "Aww, don't start holding out on me now. We're so close.": 1, "Aww, I'm hungry! Can we get some food, instead?": 1, "Awake at last, good.": 1, "Awafalagahuka.": 1, "Aw, mama, I want to stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!": 1, "Avulstein... you stupid boy...": 1, "Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!": 1, "Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!": 1, "Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!": 1, "Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Avast, dog!": 1, "Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.": 1, "Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well.": 1, "Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.": 1, "Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.": 1, "Auriel, Auri-El, Alkosh, Akatosh... so many different names for the sovereign of the snow elves.": 1, "Auriel's power is ours!": 1, "Auriel's Bow. Well done, indeed.": 1, "Auriel's Bow will be mine!": 1, "Auriel's Bow is ours. Deliver it to Lord Harkon at once, so we can reap the benefits of this prophecy.": 1, "Auriel is one of the elven gods. He's with the rest of them in Aetherius.": 1, "Auri-El... save me...": 1, "Auri-El, give me strength to smite my foe!": 1, "Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on our world wasn't.": 1, "Auri-El forgives you.": 1, "Auri-El bless you, child. For you are a step closer to the Inner Sanctum and everlasting wisdom.": 1, "Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you.": 1, "Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.": 1, "Awww, well, maybe next time.": 1, "At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.": 1, "At that point, you'll have given him everything he's ever wanted.": 1, "At least Barknar and I are here together.": 1, "At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks.": 1, "At last. Sovngarde...": 1, "At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.": 1, "At last. I hope it was worth it. Please... be my guest. You deserve the first look.": 1, "A truly remarkable place, isn't it?": 1, "At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!": 1, "At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me.": 1, "At last, my blade is returned to its full glory.": 1, "At last, a worthy opponent!": 1, "At his age, Tharstan should have known better than to fumble about in dark tombs.": 1, "At first you may pity the thin-bloods. But after disposing of a few, you realize they aren't worth the worry.": 1, "At first it was only during the night, but now every moment is spent building some strange shrine around the Wind Stone.": 1, "At least I think it will. Probably. Almost certainly. Of course, you never can tell.": 1, "At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all.": 1, "At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause.": 1, "Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it...": 1, "Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.": 1, "Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.": 1, "Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate.": 1, "Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, sister.": 1, "Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.": 1, "Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering.": 1, "Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.": 1, "Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice.": 1, "Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship.": 1, "Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.": 1, "Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!": 1, "At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!": 1, "At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.": 1, "At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.": 1, "At least he did until you set him up with that Telvanni wizard. Now he's untouchable.": 1, "At that moment, I knew I'd never see him again. No amount of money would ever be worth that kind of death.": 1, "At some point, you're going to have to choose. No matter the outcome, I'll always respect your decision.": 1, "At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...": 1, "At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor.": 1, "At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones.": 1, "At night, the wind picks up from the ocean and... well, I'm just lucky to keep warm.": 1, "At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.": 1, "At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak.": 1, "At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now.": 1, "At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard.": 1, "At least, that's my hope. We've all learned lessons at the expense of this recent unpleasantness.": 1, "At least, if you're gonna cause trouble, go somewhere else, okay? Please?": 1, "At least, I think so. ": 1, "At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.": 1, "At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself.": 1, "At least you don't have to taste every time to see if it's brewed right.": 1, "A true professional would have kept his cool and dealt with it a different way, but I'll let it go.": 1, "At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment.": 1, "At least the hunting will be easier with the beasts so close. ": 1, "At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.": 1, "At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.": 1, "At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back.": 1, "At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.": 1, "At least six of the diggers are dead. The rest of them ran off, and I don't blame them.": 1, "At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn.": 1, "At least my father will let me drink whatever I want without complaining. Tell Geldis I appreciate it.": 1, "At least it's more money for the College.": 1, "At least hear me out before you walk away.": 1, "At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.": 1, "Assur always wants to play \"Hunt the Elf\" and he makes me be the Elf.": 1, "Ay, it can. Wouldn't want them any bigger though.": 1, "Ay, we can get that for ya. We just finished the timber for those catapults.": 1, "Back with more Stalhrim items, I trust?": 1, "Back to work.": 1, "Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here.": 1, "Back to where you came from!": 1, "Back to visit Jiub the Magnificent, eh?": 1, "A true friend is a gift. Here. I'd like you to have this.": 1, "Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him. ": 1, "Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots.": 1, "Back to the darkness with you!": 1, "Back to the adventure!": 1, "Back to my studies, then.": 1, "Back to my errands.": 1, "Back to my book...": 1, "Back, eh? Ready to brawl?": 1, "Back to making weapons.": 1, "Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.": 1, "Back to another fine day in Dawnstar.": 1, "Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!": 1, "Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.": 1, "Back so soon?": 1, "Back so soon Xander?": 1, "Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one.": 1, "Back off!": 1, "Back in the homeland, there are other Telvanni wizards that have them as well.": 1, "Back in the Second Era, the Jarl of Riften had a son. Adventurous type, too much for his own good it seems.": 1, "Back in 95, Vilur Ulen came to Raven Rock with a plan to take over our town.": 1, "Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?": 1, "Back for more? Since we had so much fun the last time, I'll join you free of charge.": 1, "Back to dust!": 1, "Back already? Can't wait.": 1, "Back, godless beast!": 1, "Back... to... the Void...": 1, "Balgruuf will know my meaning.": 1, "Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade.": 1, "Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his city.": 1, "Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war.": 1, "Baldor is the keeper of an ancient tradition, the forging of Stalhrim. It is an art we Skaal hold sacred.": 1, "Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin.": 1, "Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor.": 1, "Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?": 1, "Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.": 1, "Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now...": 1, "Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic.": 1, "Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.": 1, "Bah. Don't even mention that place to me. This whole trip has been a disaster.": 1, "Back, huh? Well, price is still 4,000 coins.": 1, "Bah. Another honest man lost in all this madness. And for what?": 1, "Bah, it's no use. Let's get back to it, then.": 1, "Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot.": 1, "Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.": 1, "Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.": 1, "Bah! Save your magic. A warrior should face her foe, not hide from him.": 1, "Bah! Patience is for the young. An old dunmer like me can't afford it.": 1, "Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.": 1, "Bagaru!": 1, "Bad? What if I told you that you're the first person that's even considered looking at my wares today.": 1, "Bad people. They come, fight us. We fight back now.": 1, "Bad move.": 1, "Bad Nords. Say Thirsk theirs. Live by water, bother tribe-kin.": 1, "Backbiter.": 1, "Bah, you're just like the rest of the folks around here.": 1, "Ay, it is.  I suppose it won't hurt the girl to eat it this once.": 1, "Back again? What is it this time?": 1, "Baaaa roooka!": 1, "Aye, they're an old clan like ours, but they cast their lot with the Empire when the uprising began.": 1, "Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose.": 1, "Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it \"our golden age.\"": 1, "Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.": 1, "Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring.": 1, "Aye, that sounds like him. ": 1, "Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back.": 1, "Aye, that he was. And you sniffed him out because he broke one of the cardinal rules of our business... he got greedy.": 1, "Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work.": 1, "Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord.": 1, "Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes.": 1, "Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold.": 1, "Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age.": 1, "Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory.": 1, "Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get. ": 1, "Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision.": 1, "Aye, he does indeed... and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt.": 1, "Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn.": 1, "Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing.": 1, "Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend...": 1, "Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?": 1, "Aye, I'll hate it, but I'll do it if I have to.": 1, "Aye, I was. Didn't progress very far. Never did care for their attitude, acting like they're better than everyone else.": 1, "Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof.": 1, "Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite.": 1, "Aye, 'til next time.": 1, "Aye lass.": 1, "Aye lad.": 1, "Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!": 1, "Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving.": 1, "Aye, we used to be fast friends, though it was long ago.": 1, "Aye, you've got a point there.": 1, "Ba ba ba, bum ba, ba ba ba, bum ba, ba da da da, dum da da...": 1, "Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me.": 1, "Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.": 1, "Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.": 1, "Azura, forgive me...": 1, "Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it.": 1, "Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.": 1, "Azura's Star is ours. Ours!": 1, "Azura take you.": 1, "Azura take you!": 1, "Azura preserve us.": 1, "Azura knows he needs all the help he can get. He's been chasing the Ulens for years now.": 1, "Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.": 1, "Aye, with a certainty.": 1, "Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him.": 1, "Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.": 1, "Ayrag ga!": 1, "Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed.": 1, "Aye. The blood still runs true among some on Solstheim, as it has for centuries. We have chosen to embrace Lord Hircine's blessing.": 1, "Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains.": 1, "Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge.": 1, "Aye. She's by the fire.": 1, "Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.": 1, "Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though.": 1, "Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.": 1, "Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.": 1, "Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.": 1, "Aye. And you be careful with the creature.": 1, "Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.": 1, "Are you sure? I'm willing to do it, but you need to think it through.": 1, "Assuming you have the smithing skills, you should be able to make this yourself at Gunmar's forge. Either way, I'll have some for sale soon.": 1, "Assorted wares and tools you just can't live without! Come and see for yourself!": 1, "As I said, it's easy to find things nobody will miss. My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. You could be too.": 1, "As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone.": 1, "As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied.": 1, "As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that.": 1, "As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment.": 1, "As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries.": 1, "As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.": 1, "As Councilor, I hereby award you Severin Manor and everything contained within.": 1, "Arvak?": 1, "Arvak...You saved him! His soul is free, I can feel it!": 1, "Arvak. My horse. We came to this horrible place together. We were attacked by monsters, so I told him to run.": 1, "Arvak, please! You can stop running now!": 1, "Arvak! Arvak, where are you? Arvak, please come back! Come back!": 1, "As I said, we need to restore the steam supply to the reading room if we want to get the book.": 1, "Arvak!  Where are you, boy?": 1, "Arrrgh...": 1, "Arrrggghh...": 1, "Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up.": 1, "Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.": 1, "Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.": 1, "Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.": 1, "Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.": 1, "Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people.": 1, "Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit.": 1, "Arngeir. Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.": 1, "Arngeir. Rek los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.": 1, "Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks.

Forged by a master craftsman!": 1, "As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him.": 1, "As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course.

I've made many forays into the ancient ruins that cover the island.": 1, "As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.": 1, "As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.": 1, "As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.": 1, "As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you.": 1, "As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me.": 1, "As I told you when I gave you the Oghma Infinium, your free will is an illusion. Why else would you be here?": 1, "As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?": 1, "As a matter of fact, I need a hagraven claw.

I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect.": 1, "Are you the one sent by Mara?": 1, "Are you the assassin? From the...? Well, there's this Traveling Dignitary, in Solitude. I need her... you know. This gold will cover it, right?": 1, "Are you taking me to him?": 1, "Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course.": 1, "Are you... offering to help?": 1, "Arkay's never clear on life and death.

Our great enemy is the sun, and until recently it's an enemy we've had no way to fight.": 1, "As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts.

But, the issue could be solved another way.": 1, "A very powerful family in Windhelm.": 1, "As you can see, we have some work to do to restore it to its former glory. But maybe you want to help me with that?": 1, "As you can see, most of the lower levels of the city are flooded. But it isn't hopeless - the old Dwemer pumps still seem to work. Watch.": 1, "As you can see, it has not yet arrived.": 1, "As you can see, I have much that requires my attention.

Be ready for anything.": 1, "Ashamed. But I guess that was the point.": 1, "As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful.": 1, "Ash yams? Disgusting. I'd rather eat cheese that's been sitting in the sun for a week.": 1, "Ash and ice! Who did this? Come out and face me like a man!": 1, "As you'll see, that's easier said than done. This way to the boilers.": 1, "As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.": 1, "As you wish. We can consider this incident nothing more than an unfortunate misunderstanding.": 1, "As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song.": 1, "A vampire?": 1, "A venison pie, maybe?

One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.": 1, "As in all things, Lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see.": 1, "As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.": 1, "As if we didn't have enough to contend with already.": 1, "As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth.": 1, "As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?": 1, "As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.": 1, "As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern.": 1, "As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome.": 1, "As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome.": 1, "As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders.": 1, "As he should I suppose.": 1, "As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town.": 1, "As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.": 1, "As for what she might like...": 1, "As for the other, the last that I heard, it was lost in the bowels of a Dwemer ruin.": 1, "As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything.": 1, "As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um.": 1, "As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist. ": 1, "As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals.": 1, "As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford.": 1, "As fearless in death as he was in life.": 1, "As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it.": 1, "As far as I've heard, no one's seen them and returned to Tamriel to tell about it.": 1, "As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls.": 1, "As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine.": 1, "As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim.

Not soon, anyway.": 1, "As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade.": 1, "As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile.": 1, "As promised, here's a little something for yourself.": 1, "As promised, I now teach you the first word of Soul Tearing: \"Rii\" - the essence of your enemy's life force.": 1, "As part of their \"duties,\" the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf.": 1, "As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration.": 1, "As one Thieves Guild member to another?

I won't.": 1, "As much as I enjoy this place, I'm ready to see if we can actually open the book's protective case.

You don't want to hear them sing.": 1, "As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.": 1, "As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with.": 1, "As much as it pains me to send you and Serana back alone, I can't take the risk.": 1, "A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine.": 1, "And now you have it. No harm done.": 1, "And now we're stuck out here listening to it all day and night. ": 1, "Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed.

He agreed to sell.": 1, "Ah, well now you can help me directly! Far more useful, I think.": 1, "Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time.": 1, "Ah, welcome, welcome! I don't believe we've seen you here before, have we? You can buy from me, then join any booth you'd like.": 1, "Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?": 1, "Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable.": 1, "Ah, this is good. But J'zargo will know them first.": 1, "Ah, this is bonemold armor... quite impressive, wouldn't you say?": 1, "Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit.": 1, "Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again.": 1, "Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss.": 1, "Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you.": 1, "Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of. ": 1, "Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know.": 1, "Ah, the sweet smell of burnt flesh. Nothing better really.": 1, "Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!": 1, "Ah, the prophecy. Be wary of prophecy. Some are meant as a guide. Some as a warning. Are you sure you can tell one from the other?": 1, "Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!": 1, "Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite.": 1, "Ah, the nectar of the gods! If there's ever anything I can do for you, just name it!": 1, "Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.": 1, "Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?": 1, "Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow.": 1, "Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make.": 1, "Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends, as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste.": 1, "Ah, the Hall of Stories. These are found in many ancient Nord tombs.": 1, "Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work.": 1, "Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely.": 1, "Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay for the job. You earned it, after all.": 1, "Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!": 1, "Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?": 1, "Ah, you are here. Good.": 1, "Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting.": 1, "Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them.": 1, "Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work.": 1, "Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out.": 1, "Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later.": 1, "Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point.": 1, "Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you.": 1, "Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?": 1, "Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade.": 1, "Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive.": 1, "Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now.": 1, "Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.": 1, "Ah, yes. That. There were... well, complications.": 1, "Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away.": 1, "Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying...": 1, "Ah, yes. Saint Jiub, Jiub the Eradicator, Jiub the Magnificent... I've earned a lot of those titles thanks to my campaign against the Winged Menace.": 1, "Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything.": 1, "Ah, yes. No fat on this one!": 1, "Ah, yes. I see. Well, if you do change your mind, please let me know.": 1, "Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds.": 1, "Ah, yes. Hmm. I'm afraid they don't quite work that way.": 1, "Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by.": 1, "Ah, yes, the lure of the Black Book.": 1, "Ah, yes, the Elder Scroll! I admit, I'm looking forward to this.": 1, "Ah, yes, here's something. The first one has to do with a breeze, or maybe it's wind.": 1, "Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure.": 1, "Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn.": 1, "Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed.": 1, "Ah, that's too bad.": 1, "Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research.": 1, "Ah, my son, you'll be a fine innkeeper someday, like your father.": 1, "Ah, my rescuer! It's good to see you again.": 1, "Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no...": 1, "Ah, my friend from Cidhna Mine. Hello.": 1, "Ah, my favorite customer.": 1, "Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry.": 1, "Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?": 1, "Ah, my benefactor.": 1, "Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?": 1, "Ah, kinsman. How my heart soars to look upon a brother Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?": 1, "Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once.": 1, "Ah, it's you. Yes, well, now we'll see if the stories about you are true.": 1, "Ah, it's so good to breathe again!": 1, "Ah, my thanks. Malacath watch over ya.": 1, "Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time.": 1, "Ah, it's good to be home again.": 1, "Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!": 1, "Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?": 1, "Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?": 1, "Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think...": 1, "About your account... it's been a few months...": 1, "Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.": 1, "Ah, indeed? The Jarl... Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.": 1, "Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though.": 1, "Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!": 1, "Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike.": 1, "Ah, here's the proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony.": 1, "Ah, here's the blushing bride now. Let's begin the ceremony.": 1, "About time. Let's go.": 1, "Ah, that's the trick!": 1, "Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker - perhaps even a scholar?": 1, "Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding.": 1, "Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions.": 1, "Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.": 1, "Ah, that is good to hear, then.": 1, "Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger.": 1, "Ah, sweet Oblivion. Soon I shall return. ": 1, "Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first...": 1, "Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other.": 1, "Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know.": 1, "Ah, splendid! I had no doubt you'd make it across. Let's see what awaits us ahead.": 1, "About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders.": 1, "Ah, so you aren't just another wandering vagrant with a pocket full of stories. Apologies. That changes things.": 1, "Ah, so you appear able to resist the effect by exerting your will. Fascinating!": 1, "Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?": 1, "Ah, no. Don't think you've got the stuff. Come back when you've seen a bit more in life, perhaps.": 1, "Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals.": 1, "Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?": 1, "Ah, so it's gold you're after, then? ": 1, "Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this.": 1, "Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song.": 1, "Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there.": 1, "Ah, of course. The prophecy. You've come here to stop me from taking Auriel's Bow and shrouding the world in darkness.": 1, "Ah, of course. I suspected as much.": 1, "Ah, of course! How much have you got?": 1, "Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.": 1, "Ah, now we can finish this.": 1, "Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel...": 1, "Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?": 1, "Ah, now here is an item out of legend. This is Ysgramor's Soup Spoon. ": 1, "Ah, so now my dear Pelagius can hate himself for being legitimately afraid of things that actually threaten his existence...": 1, "Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?": 1, "Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?": 1, "Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?": 1, "Alduin's Wall was created by the ancient Akaviri Dragonguard, the forerunners of the Blades.": 1, "Alduin will hide in this lightless mist until we Shout together, and shatter his power.": 1, "Alduin sizaan midroti.": 1, "Alduin saraan hin sil ko Sovngarde!": 1, "Alduin mah nol thur.": 1, "Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.": 1, "Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.": 1, "Alduin cannot ignore this for long.": 1, "Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul.": 1, "Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you.": 1, "Alas, the vampire can cloud the minds of those he preys upon. It won't be easy to convince anyone he's other than he appears.": 1, "Alakasee.": 1, "Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of... monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.": 1, "Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.": 1, "Alain made all the pain just... go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields...": 1, "Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work.": 1, "Akar. Majni's brother.": 1, "Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.": 1, "Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working.": 1, "Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.": 1, "Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?": 1, "Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.": 1, "Ain't sure if they're takin' on new members, but you should talk to the Companions. They're over in their hall, Jorrvaskr.": 1, "Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.": 1, "Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.": 1, "Ain't nobody high and mighty in these halls, exceptin' the Jarl. And don't you forget!": 1, "Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.": 1, "Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.": 1, "Alain is... is dead?": 1, "Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.": 1, "Alduin's Wall... one of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.": 1, "Alduin, thuri!": 1, "All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.": 1, "All for an old crown, huh?": 1, "All eyes are on you, lass. Don't disappoint us.": 1, "All eyes are on you, lad. Don't disappoint us.": 1, "All clean. I feel like I can breathe again for the first time since I was turned.": 1, "About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard.": 1, "All I'm wondering is how long it'll take for House Redoran to begin ignoring us again if the mine runs out of ore for a second time.": 1, "All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.": 1, "All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.": 1, "All I wanted is for us to be a family again... for things to return to the way they were before.": 1, "All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much.": 1, "All I remember is that damn dremora and his minions bursting into my home and sending me to their prison.": 1, "All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own weapon, Auriel's Bow.": 1, "Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.": 1, "All I need to do is get the word out that it's ready and they'll flock here for it.": 1, "All I need is one to cut you in half.": 1, "All I need is for you to back me up. You don't even need to lie... just don't tell anyone else what you heard here.": 1, "All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.": 1, "All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.": 1, "All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin.": 1, "All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions.": 1, "All I heard is that without a Septim sitting on the throne of the Empire, the Dragonfires in a place called the Temple of the One were no longer lit.": 1, "All I had to do was mention our little infestation, and she volunteered in a second!": 1, "All I had to do was mention our little infestation, and he volunteered in a second!": 1, "All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.": 1, "All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive!": 1, "Alive.... You're alive... Thank Sithis... ": 1, "Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik?": 1, "All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious.": 1, "Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need.": 1, "Aim for the middle target.": 1, "Aiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!": 1, "Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do.": 1, "Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.": 1, "Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!": 1, "Ah... here's the \"blood seal.\" Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood.": 1, "Ah... To be honest, no. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them.": 1, "Ah... How my heart soars to look upon a sister Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?": 1, "Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us.": 1, "Ah. Well. After a little incident with a roguish lad and the daughter of a prominent Thane... Well, let's just say, best not.": 1, "Ah. Well, then. Let me know if you need anything.": 1, "Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps.": 1, "Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.": 1, "Ah. Thank you! Excellent. Now... where were we?": 1, "Ah. No, that was not supposed to happen.": 1, "Ah...damn you!": 1, "Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here.": 1, "Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:": 1, "Ah. I see. I hope she... fought well. ": 1, "Ah. I see.": 1, "Ah. I have expected you. Prodah.": 1, "Ah. Ha ha! Come here, come here come here come here!": 1, "Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf.": 1, "Ah. Been working more on his secret hideout, has he? It'll be interesting to see how much progress he's made.": 1, "Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?": 1, "Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.": 1, "Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is...": 1, "Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?": 1, "Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?": 1, "Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear.": 1, "About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?": 1, "Aiiiiiiiieeeeee!": 1, "Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you - the Gourmet!": 1, "Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!": 1, "About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter.": 1, "Aia. You're so mean. I don't think he means anything by it.": 1, "Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while.": 1, "Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics.": 1, "Ahzidal, arise!": 1, "Ahzidal! Awaken!": 1, "Ahmik oblaan. My service to you is over.": 1, "Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?": 1, "Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him.": 1, "Ahhhhhhhh!": 1, "Ahhhhh.....": 1, "Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?": 1, "Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Aha! Here's another of those dragon language inscriptions! I wonder what it says.": 1, "Ahhh... no one will know I'm here now.": 1, "Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters.": 1, "Ahhh. Yes...": 1, "Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one.": 1, "Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick.": 1, "Ahh... yeah.": 1, "Ahh... You are Dragonborn. I can feel it. And yet...": 1, "Ahh, yes. I see it now.": 1, "Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible.": 1, "Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?": 1, "Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad.": 1, "Aha... and now you die.": 1, "Aha.": 1, "Aha! You're back!": 1, "Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side...": 1, "All four boilers need to be working if you want to release the book. I thought I was clear about that.": 1, "Ah, hello there!": 1, "Ah, hello my Nord friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?": 1, "Again with the mead!": 1, "After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords.": 1, "After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple.": 1, "After you, Dragonborn.": 1, "After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain.": 1, "After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety.": 1, "After what I've put Serana through, I would understand if she never wished to see me again. I leave that decision in your hands.": 1, "After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor.": 1, "After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.": 1, "After we left Morrowind, we found ourselves in Skyrim.": 1, "After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished.": 1, "After they died, Majni and Akar took care of me, taught me to hunt. I'm not as good as they are, but... I do my best.": 1, "After the so-called \"battle\" of Pale Pass, the Akaviri went into his service. This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire.": 1, "Again, and we break his grim hold over Shor's realm, and redeem it for eternity!": 1, "After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense.": 1, "After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild.": 1, "After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension.": 1, "After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while.": 1, "After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again.": 1, "After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still.": 1, "After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for while.": 1, "After so many centuries, I feared the Elder Scroll and my daughter were lost to me.": 1, "After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer.": 1, "After my bite, you collapsed and fell into a slumber. Now your flesh has acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. ": 1, "After his defeat, Miraak was banished to Solstheim and the guardian was made his jailer.": 1, "After he moved on to greener pastures, I decided to pack up, move out here and put those lessons to the test. Been here ever since.": 1, "After everything you've already done for Raven Rock, I hate to ask for more but I can't risk Councilor Morvayn being killed.": 1, "After everything we've been through, it had damn well better work.": 1, "After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat.": 1, "After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim.": 1, "Again, as one! The World-Eater fears us!": 1, "Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?": 1, "Agreed, we can't afford to try again.": 1, "Agra!": 1, "Agra Zen!": 1, "Agra Vel!": 1, "Agra Kul!": 1, "Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...": 1, "Aghh! Just... die already!": 1, "Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.": 1, "Agh! It... hurts...": 1, "Agh! It... hurts.": 1, "Agh! I been wounded worse by better!": 1, "Agh! Enough! This ends now!": 1, "Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!": 1, "Again, together! Alduin is strong!": 1, "Agh! Bastard!": 1, "Aggghh! Re...lease me!": 1, "Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing.": 1, "Agaroo?": 1, "Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule.": 1, "Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.": 1, "Again? You just had an \"extended hunt\" last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it.": 1, "Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!": 1, "Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?": 1, "Again? Buy some food this time will you?": 1, "Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there. ": 1, "Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.": 1, "Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?": 1, "Again?": 1, "Aggh! ": 1, "Agreed. We all stay together.": 1, "After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.": 1, "After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days.": 1, "Adrianne. At her forge, just outside.": 1, "Adelaisa, I'm sorry.": 1, "Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.": 1, "Addvar won't sell anything if I don't go and check up on him.": 1, "Adara bends the silver so naturally. Grandmother would have cried if she saw how deft our daughter has become.": 1, "Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!": 1, "Actually... I do. Little joke.": 1, "Actually, you do. Sort of.": 1, "Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is.": 1, "Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out.": 1, "Actually, now that I think of it... I'm going to come along with you.": 1, "Actually, now that I think of it, I have been missing the Ashfire. It's a special brew that we make at Thirsk.": 1, "Actually, I'm growing it if you hadn't noticed.": 1, "Adril Arano, Second Councilor of Raven Rock.": 1, "Actually, I wonder if...": 1, "Actually, I do.": 1, "Actually, I admire how you handled the situation.": 1, "Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.": 1, "Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.": 1, "Ach, there you are.": 1, "According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into.": 1, "According to Councilor Morvayn, my husband's been Raven Rock's most important food source for decades.": 1, "Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference.": 1, "Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.": 1, "Absolutely. You could turn around and travel back from wherever you started empty handed, or you could assist me.": 1, "Absolutely. When we say \"walk with the shadows,\" we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us.": 1, "Absolutely. I've spent a great deal of time perfecting an extract that increases the potency of soul husks.": 1, "Absolutely. I can only do twenty at a time, so if you want the rest of your arrows blessed, let me know.": 1, "Actually, I was just wondering if you could make sure people are tended to if they get hurt. I'm sure you wouldn't object to that.": 1, "After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice.": 1, "Adril and I lived in Blacklight, the capital city of Morrowind.": 1, "Adril... I haven't seen a smile on your face like that in a long time.": 1, "After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?": 1, "After all you've put that man through. You should be more loyal to him.": 1, "After all we've been through together, I refuse to let Councilor Morvayn down.": 1, "After all these years, they're gouging us for every last drake we have.": 1, "After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have the scroll.": 1, "After all these years, Lady Serana's back. Now that's something.": 1, "After all that it's been through, the College still stands. In no small part thanks to you!": 1, "After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence.": 1, "After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk.": 1, "After I was freed from prison, I decided to turn my life around. Give something back to the people of Morrowind.": 1, "After Gratian died, he left behind a wife and a son... my grandfather, Rellicus.": 1, "After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length.": 1, "After 400 years, you think you'll be the one to take me down?": 1, "Adril, a word please.": 1, "Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.": 1, "Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose...": 1, "Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything.": 1, "Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?": 1, "Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart.": 1, "Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?": 1, "Aeri's the boss. Should talk to her if you want work.": 1, "Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now.": 1, "Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me.": 1, "Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind.": 1, "Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?": 1, "Aedra, what a day!": 1, "Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?": 1, "Aduri is what some would call a free spirit. She likes to wander the fall forest for hours on end.": 1, "Afraid not. But if you're serious about sharpening that tongue, you might try the Bard's College in Solitude.": 1, "Ah, hello my good friend. Would you do me a kindness? I seem to be down to my last drop of spirits. Let me tell you, sobriety is highly overrated.": 1, "Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse.": 1, "Ah baa faroo!": 1, "Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!": 1, "Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?": 1, "Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.": 1, "Ah, at last! I hope you found the place all right.": 1, "Ah, another plaything for my collection.": 1, "Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise.": 1, "Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will.": 1, "Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright \"own\" Frost...": 1, "Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord?": 1, "Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend.": 1, "Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!": 1, "Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment.": 1, "Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul.": 1, "Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!": 1, "Ah, a letter from the Jarl! Moving up in the world, eh?": 1, "Absolutely not! I protest... uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just... oh never mind.": 1, "Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?": 1, "Ah, Yngvar, here to sing? You know an employee of the Silver-Blood family is always a guest of honor here.": 1, "Ah, Viarmo.  I assume you are here to petition for the reinstatement of the Burning of King Olaf Festival.": 1, "Ah, Thonar, don't you worry. Nana Ildene isn't going anywhere.": 1, "Ah, Solitude. Best port in Skyrim. You should try the Spiced Mead while you're there.": 1, "Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?": 1, "Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?": 1, "Ah, Nana Ildene, whatever would my family do without you?": 1, "Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?": 1, "Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need. ": 1, "Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matters little.": 1, "Ah, I think that'll do just the trick.": 1, "Ah, a fresh mortal who seeks to bargain with me.": 1, "Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!": 1, "Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?": 1, "Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary.": 1, "Ah, hello my Khajiit friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?": 1, "Ah, hello my Argonian friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?": 1, "Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them.": 1, "Ah, good. Now we can see if we can find a way to get that next cube.": 1, "Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.": 1, "Ah, good, good. Now please, take this. Just my way of saying thanks.": 1, "Ah, good! Another cube. We're finally making some progress.": 1, "Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.": 1, "Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.": 1, "Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?": 1, "Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself.": 1, "Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to.": 1, "Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer.": 1, "Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain.": 1, "Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem.": 1, "Ah, everybody around here's so serious.": 1, "Ah, err, yes. Sorry.": 1, "Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month...": 1, "Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right.": 1, "Ah, but you see this particular Dunmer was as naked as the day he was born and singing badly at the top of his lungs.": 1, "Ah, but you look tired. Come, share a bottle of Honningbrew Mead with me!": 1, "Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!": 1, "Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis.": 1, "Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there.": 1, "Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?": 1, "Ah, but there is a slight... problem.": 1, "Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or... anyone. But some day...": 1, "Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...? ": 1, "Ah, excellent! We'll just call this a misunderstanding between friends. I've already forgotten it, myself.": 1, "Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.": 1, "Ah, I see. Very well, my friend. I'll do it.": 1, "Ah, I see. I've just remembered that I saved a few septims in case of an emergency. This is starting to feel like one.": 1, "Ah! Don't do that.": 1, "Ah! Damn wizard. Keep your spells off of me. ": 1, "Ah! Are you planning on hurting me again?": 1, "Ah! An excellent suggestion. I'll do that one, then.": 1, "Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.": 1, "Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.": 1, "Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.": 1, "Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen.": 1, "Ah yes, their trickery.": 1, "Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses.": 1, "Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you.": 1, "Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother.": 1, "Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years.": 1, "Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I...": 1, "Ah yes, I remember your Moth Priest now.": 1, "Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length.": 1, "Ah wonderful, I knew it would be. This is a significant find.": 1, "Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.": 1, "Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course.": 1, "Ah well.": 1, "Ah well, it was a long shot.": 1, "Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?": 1, "Ah ha.": 1, "Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!": 1, "Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again.": 1, "Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?": 1, "Ah good, I could use some practice!": 1, "Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to.": 1, "Ah yes, Bera's silver necklace. It was a wedding gift and she rarely took it off.": 1, "Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood \"silent intimidation\" treatment.  ": 1, "Ah! Here it is.": 1, "Ah! I feel like I just woke from a nap.": 1, "Ah, I see you've been speaking to Valerica and she's convinced you that eternal night will plunge us into war with daytime dwellers.": 1, "Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk.": 1, "Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant.": 1, "Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!": 1, "Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered.": 1, "Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know.": 1, "Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need.": 1, "Ah, Camilla. Fair as the morning sun. But I ask you, how could she prefer your brooding to my romantic tunes?": 1, "Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks.": 1, "Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age.": 1, "Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs.": 1, "Ah! Well done! Well done!": 1, "Ah! The wood is for the staffs. Put them away when you get a chance. But don't get in my way.": 1, "Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you.": 1, "Ah! The free air of Vus at long last!": 1, "Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me.": 1, "Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.": 1, "Ah! That was almost... exhilarating. How are you feeling?": 1, "Ah! That felt refreshing.": 1, "Ah! So, that's where that goes!": 1, "Ah! Picking on an old man? What did I ever do to you?": 1, "Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself.": 1, "Ah! Keep your spells away from me.": 1, "Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.": 1, "Ah! It burns!": 1, "Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it.": 1, "Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating...": 1, "Ah! I'm just an old woman. Don't hurt me.": 1, "Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.": 1, "And now winter is coming.": 1, "All four boilers need to be working to open the casing. Are you sure you didn't remove a cube from one of the boilers?": 1, "All hail the Emperor. All hail his Legionnaires!": 1, "And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men? ": 1, "And I see now that your tongue is also...well, it's probably best if I don't say. Don't bother trying to scream though.": 1, "And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! - if you would only ask me to do it!": 1, "And I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.": 1, "And I have half a mind to tell Lokil of your disloyalty.": 1, "And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions.": 1, "And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out. ": 1, "And I don't think she needs any help from you to do that.": 1, "And I can't forge air. ": 1, "And Erikur?": 1, "And Elisif?": 1, "And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates.": 1, "And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's \"ambitions.\" Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.": 1, "And I suppose you're the one Tolan says is actually doing something about this mess.": 1, "Ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since the All-Maker first gave Solstheim to the Skaal.": 1, "Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now.": 1, "Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.": 1, "Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!": 1, "Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.": 1, "Ancano is doing something with that thing... the Eye. We can't stop him!": 1, "Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it.": 1, "Anavchnzel is waiting.": 1, "An' maybe it won't.": 1, "An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.": 1, "An unattended attachment, such as found in your beloved wife creates... an opportunity for unnecessary agitation.": 1, "An unattended attachment, such as found in your beloved husband creates... an opportunity for unnecessary agitation.": 1, "An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.": 1, "An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions? ": 1, "Ancestors guide you.": 1, "An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw.": 1, "And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.": 1, "And I thought the Soul Cairn was creepy.": 1, "And all can be undone if Miraak exerts his will again. You must continue on your path, and gather the knowledge you need to defeat him.": 1, "And a whole lot of good that's gotten us. ": 1, "And a very ancient one.": 1, "And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it.": 1, "And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.": 1, "And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.": 1, "And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.": 1, "And Mercer Frey?": 1, "And Meieran thinks that we should go there.": 1, "And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.": 1, "And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies.": 1, "And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.": 1, "And I'm telling you, you're wrong.": 1, "And I thought my father was the delusional one.": 1, "And I'm telling you that I'll do whatever it takes to find my great-grandfather's remains. He's down here, I can feel it.": 1, "And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with.": 1, "And I'm supposed to run my operation outside in a pile of ash? I don't think so.": 1, "And I'm not talking about Hermaeus Mora. These Black Books are all his, of course.": 1, "Aaaaaaaaaaa....": 1, "And I'm not half the vampire Lord Harkon is. Truth is I'm better with a forge than I am with claws or fangs.": 1, "And I'm not even mentioning the fact that now we'll never know what would have happened when Miraak returned.": 1, "And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is.": 1, "And I'm a porter with no shipments coming in. You're not getting any coin from me, Degaine.": 1, "And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again.": 1, "And I'll be unnecessary once he has it.": 1, "And I'd like you to find the truth of the matter.": 1, "And I wasn't stuttering. No key.": 1, "And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.": 1, "And I'm sure you could do it, too. ": 1, "And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.": 1, "An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor. ": 1, "An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself.": 1, "Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.": 1, "Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.": 1, "Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.": 1, "Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...": 1, "Amativ! Mu bo kotin stinselok.": 1, "Am I? Am I?": 1, "Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day.": 1, "Am I to take your silence as acceptance?": 1, "Am I supposed to be frightened?": 1, "Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?": 1, "Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds.": 1, "Am I going have to beat it out of you? Is that what you want?": 1, "Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.": 1, "Amazing to think that they built this so long ago, and it still survives.": 1, "Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing.": 1, "Always time for a fellow bard.": 1, "Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.": 1, "Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.": 1, "Always such a model for decency in these troubled times, Yngvar.": 1, "Always something going wrong. Mill needs more lumber or the saw needs sharpening.": 1, "Always nice to speak to someone from the mainland.": 1, "Always looking on the bright side, aren't you.": 1, "Always have your shield at the ready.": 1, "Always good to talk to a fellow bard.": 1, "Always good to see someone I can trust.": 1, "Always good to see folk come back for more. You need a drink, you just let me know.": 1, "Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least...": 1, "Always good to see 'em go.": 1, "Always was a stubborn woman. She's not going to stand down.": 1, "An old woman can get away with almost anything.": 1, "Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.": 1, "Amazing...": 1, "An old tomb, I think. It must have been opened by an earthquake that accompanied one of the Red Mountain's eruptions.": 1, "An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in handy.": 1, "An old storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.": 1, "An old jetty where boats would bring supplies to the castle. Once we moved in, it never got used, along with the rest of the undercroft.": 1, "An old escape tunnel from the castle exits there. I think that's our way in.": 1, "An investment? Very well, I don't see why not.": 1, "An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use.": 1, "An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope.": 1, "An impressive display, but a wasted effort. You delay nothing but your own deaths!": 1, "An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.": 1, "An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II.": 1, "An elf that studies stars? Where did you hear about that?": 1, "An axe imbued with magic fueled by the destruction of the unholy. With every victorious blow against an undead creature, its power grows.": 1, "Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!": 1, "An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land.": 1, "An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much?": 1, "An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...": 1, "An ancient font, full of power. As much as it looks like blood, sadly it is not. Can you imagine if it were? We'd never need to hunt again.": 1, "An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat.": 1, "An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look.": 1, "Aaaaiiiiieeee!": 1, "An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.": 1, "An Amulet of Mara? I haven't seen such a thing in a very long time.": 1, "Amusing.": 1, "Among the debris were heart stones. Even two centuries later, they still smolder with the heat of the mountain.": 1, "Among other things, I have some fresh bread I baked this morning and vegetables from Finna's garden.": 1, "Ambushed by vampires... I certainly wasn't expecting that.": 1, "Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...": 1, "An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity.": 1, "Always good to have a backup plan, in case the claws and teeth aren't enough.": 1, "And an assault on the Betrayed guarding the Inner Sanctum would only end with my death.": 1, "And another soul for Sithis.": 1, "And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...": 1, "And just why would you be doing that?": 1, "And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!": 1, "And just what's that supposed to mean?": 1, "And just what do you think you're doing?": 1, "And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channeled back through the nexus a second and third time...": 1, "And it's full of vampires?": 1, "And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.": 1, "And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.": 1, "And it shows, I've seen horkers with smaller guts.": 1, "And it seems we have a problem.": 1, "And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.": 1, "And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.": 1, "And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...": 1, "And it is only a matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the minds of its people.": 1, "And it all ended with me being locked underground for who knows how long.": 1, "And instead you found me. So what's your next step, now that I'm here?": 1, "And indeed, there are many that call us heroes.": 1, "And indeed, there are many that call me hero.": 1, "And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again.": 1, "And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.": 1, "And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.": 1, "And in my case, since he's already deemed me worthy, it will just be a matter of him remembering why he blessed me before.": 1, "And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all. ": 1, "And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it.": 1, "And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence.": 1, "And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone.": 1, "And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't.": 1, "And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of \"High King.\" ": 1, "And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not.": 1, "And killed them. In his honor.": 1, "And leave my farm? No thank you.": 1, "And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.": 1, "And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.": 1, "And now the feeding begins.": 1, "And now the Stormcloaks have claimed the entire city. I guess we have Roggvir to thank for that as well.": 1, "And now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging for my protection?": 1, "And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?": 1, "And now that they've solved their little pirate problem, they're busier than ever.": 1, "And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement.": 1, "And now he comes again for what we have long kept from him.": 1, "And now for the feast.": 1, "And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.": 1, "And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.": 1, "And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. ": 1, "And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.": 1, "And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead.": 1, "And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.": 1, "A word, my love?": 1, "And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.": 1, "And most of us are quite satisfied with that.": 1, "And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure.": 1, "A... can't you tell just from looking at me? A vampire.": 1, "And might I add, this is a remarkable fortress. I have colleagues back home that would love to study this place in detail.": 1, "And me and Mila used to climb up on the roof of Dragonsreach and look for birds' eggs.": 1, "And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!": 1, "And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.": 1, "And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing.": 1, "And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them.": 1, "And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual.": 1, "And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch.": 1, "And another one for me.": 1, "And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off.": 1, "And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?": 1, "And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.": 1, "And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder.": 1, "And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.": 1, "And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!": 1, "And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.": 1, "And even if it's been a struggle to make this island livable, we're proud to call it home.": 1, "And don't worry about any rioting, Legate. I have it under control.": 1, "A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?": 1, "And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.": 1, "And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines.": 1, "And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!": 1, "And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.": 1, "And damn the Moot! ": 1, "And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you.": 1, "And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?": 1, "And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy.": 1, "And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already.": 1, "And by \"supplies\" I suppose you mean weapons and armor.": 1, "And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.": 1, "And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that...": 1, "And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards.": 1, "And besides, it's really my problem anyway. I caused it.": 1, "And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form.": 1, "And begin.": 1, "And before you ask, no - I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts.": 1, "And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing.": 1, "And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought.": 1, "And any other abominations that prey on mortals. Vampires. Werewolves. Witches.": 1, "And coin is the only counterweight for a bad reputation.": 1, "And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette. ": 1, "And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power.": 1, "And from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.": 1, "And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought.": 1, "And if not, may she drown in her own tears.": 1, "And if he's that concerned, the situation must be pretty bad. Make sense?": 1, "And if he still refuses?": 1, "And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.": 1, "And if I surrender?": 1, "And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?": 1, "And how is that old warrior doing these days?": 1, "And how exactly do you plan on stopping him?": 1, "And how exactly do you plan on completing the prophecy without the death of my daughter?": 1, "And how do you know this?": 1, "And how about you?": 1, "And here's a little something for helping me out.": 1, "And frankly, I need to get home to figure out what's happening.": 1, "And here you go... your payment, just as I promised.": 1, "And here you are, just as I asked. How very kind of you.": 1, "And here we are.": 1, "And here we all are. Shall we step inside?": 1, "And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?": 1, "And heed also this. He's no pet. Mistreat the beast or leave him alone for too long, and he'll return to the wild forgetting you ever existed.": 1, "And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye.": 1, "And he's right.": 1, "And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.": 1, "And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?": 1, "And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all.": 1, "And guess who owns the Silver-Blood Inn? Not that we named it that, the people just insisted.": 1, "And go where? You can't just leave me alone whenever you feel like it. I'm coming with you, like it or not.": 1, "And from what I could tell, a thousand extra years of obsession haven't made him any better. We should have found him a hobby.": 1, "And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.": 1, "All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.": 1, "Always good talking to you... friend.": 1, "Always glad to talk to a bard.": 1, "All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold.": 1, "All right. Good luck.": 1, "All right. But remember, don't cast this without a heart stone! Otherwise the guardian will attack everyone, including you.": 1, "All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you.": 1, "All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.": 1, "All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money.": 1, "All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking.": 1, "Aav uv dir. Join me or perish with your mortal friends.": 1, "All right, you've heard what it has to say. Now tell me, is there any reason I shouldn't kill this bloodsucking fiend right now?": 1, "All right, you've had enough.": 1, "All right, you want to go?": 1, "All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after.": 1, "All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep.": 1, "All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.": 1, "All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes.": 1, "All right, then. I'll be waiting there whenever your honor wakes you.": 1, "All right, then. Hold still.": 1, "All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold.": 1, "All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please.": 1, "All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please.": 1, "All right, so obviously not this way, either.": 1, "All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.": 1, "All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!": 1, "All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?": 1, "All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either.": 1, "All right, prisoner. Eyes front. You're in Cidhna Mine, now. And we expect you to earn your keep.": 1, "All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious.": 1, "All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?": 1, "All right, then. Let's put that to the test.": 1, "All right, now pull your lever!": 1, "All right. Here goes.": 1, "All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.": 1, "All that he knows he learned from me.": 1, "All that effort, and you just kill her. You've ruined everything.": 1, "All seekers of knowledge come to me, sooner or later.": 1, "All right... End it...": 1, "All right... All right... Fine. I thought we were friends, but you're a real jerk, you know that?": 1, "All right...": 1, "All right. What's your fancy?": 1, "Aam uv dir. Those that will not serve Miraak must die.": 1, "All right. What next, then?": 1, "All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.": 1, "All right. Open her up.": 1, "All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan.": 1, "All right. Lead on, then.": 1, "All right. Here's the extract.": 1, "All right. Keep up the good work.": 1, "All right. If nothing else, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to learn more about what's going on so I can better defend myself.": 1, "All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me.": 1, "All right. I'll take care of it.": 1, "Aav dilon!": 1, "All right. I'll meet you back at the castle.": 1, "All right. I'll meet you at the glade.": 1, "All right. I'll meet you at Darkfall Cave.": 1, "All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.": 1, "All right. I'll hear out Isran, see if there's anything I can do to help.": 1, "All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.": 1, "All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.": 1, "All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin.": 1, "All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway.": 1, "All right. If you say so.": 1, "All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.": 1, "All right, mother.": 1, "All right, look. I'll consider it, but I can't just leave this bear to prey on more innocent people.": 1, "All right, I understand. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Just get off my back.": 1, "All right, I suppose I could do that.": 1, "All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?": 1, "All right, Adril. Don't worry about rushing it. Just pay me when you can.": 1, "All right then, your secret ingredient's been added.": 1, "All right men, spread out and search the tower. No telling who- or what- we're dealing with here.": 1, "All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?": 1, "All quiet now.": 1, "All over Skyrim. It's my job to collect them. I try and keep something for everyone. For every taste, I mean.": 1, "All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds.": 1, "All of the soldiers in this town are Redoran Guard... some of the best warriors that House Redoran has to offer.": 1, "All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.": 1, "All of my people have left to work on that sacred stone. It's quite fascinating. Annoying, but fascinating. ": 1, "All right, I'll go kill this giant.": 1, "All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?": 1, "All my life. She's my big sister.": 1, "All my life. I practically grew up in the Hall. My father and mother were the priest and priestess of Arkay before me, you see.": 1, "All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some.": 1, "All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!": 1, "All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes.": 1, "All men must die, often by their own means. Sounds rather grim, if you ask me.": 1, "All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!": 1, "All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe.": 1, "All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.": 1, "All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead.": 1, "All he wanted me to do is track you down and send you to him.": 1, "All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!": 1, "All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!": 1, "All of Skyrim will tremble before us.": 1, "All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom. ": 1, "All right, I'll see you there!": 1, "All right, Wilhlem. I suppose it's the least I can do for you.": 1, "All right, let's try something a bit more... fun.": 1, "All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical...": 1, "All right, let's see what you have.": 1, "All right, let's see if we can find a way out.": 1, "All right, let's not overdo it.": 1, "All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward...": 1, "All right, keep your voice down... you want everyone to hear you? I'll let you in, just let me unlock the gate.": 1, "All right, just keep it quiet. I warn you though, there's still a price on your head. Next guard you run into might not be so... agreeable.": 1, "Abide by our laws, and we'll get along well.": 1, "All right, here we go.": 1, "All right, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings.": 1, "All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!": 1, "All right, dear.": 1, "All right, I'll take a look at it.": 1, "All right, can you describe it to me?": 1, "All right, but you just watch yourself. Next time, I might not be so lenient.": 1, "All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere.": 1, "All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us?": 1, "All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota.": 1, "All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again.": 1, "All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you.": 1, "All right, all right. It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.": 1, "All right, all right. I'll speak to her.": 1, "All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand.": 1, "All right, all right. Here.": 1, "All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt.": 1, "All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now.": 1, "All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight.": 1, "All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked.": 1, "Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.": 1, "All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.": 1, "All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.": 1, "Alright... here you go. Should keep you light on your feet, and hold up decent enough if you wind up trading blows with the enemy.": 1, "Alright. This here's enough to keep your insides from spilling out, except from the fiercest of blows, and shouldn't weigh you down too much.": 1, "Alright. Now take note. He'll mind you and us Dawnguard, but there's no accounting for other folk. ": 1, "Alright. I believe you. You aren't the first to turn away from the Empire in disgust.": 1, "Alright.": 1, "Alright, you have a point. Taking you back to find out who sent them is the least I can do.": 1, "Alright, then. Let's go.": 1, "Alright, then.": 1, "Alright, now just unlock the other one.": 1, "Alright, lets see what we have next.": 1, "Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible.": 1, "Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...": 1, "Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose.": 1, "Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire.": 1, "Alright, alright... Um... How about \"The Guttersnipe\"?": 1, "Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.": 1, "Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.": 1, "Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!": 1, "Already taken care of.": 1, "Already have.": 1, "Already done.": 1, "Already done, sir.": 1, "Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.": 1, "Already did.": 1, "Alok, Vuljotnaak. Tiid boaan.": 1, "Alok, Viinturuth. Tiid boaan.": 1, "Alok, Nahagliiv. Tiid boaan.": 1, "Alms? Alms for a veteran?": 1, "Alright! One more set of dwemer plans to go.": 1, "Alms. I said \"alms\" you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand.": 1, "Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details.": 1, "Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now.": 1, "Always glad to help, serjo. What can I do for you?": 1, "Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me.": 1, "Always another big meal to cook. Figures.": 1, "Always a pleasure. What brings you back?": 1, "Always a pleasure to taste anything Geldis comes up with.": 1, "Always a pleasure to serve a fellow alchemist.": 1, "Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.": 1, "Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. Not prone to flights of fancy...": 1, "Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.": 1, "Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe. ": 1, "Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.": 1, "Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!": 1, "Although... maybe this could solve two problems...": 1, "Also, I know his heart. Nikulas is reckless and foolish, like most young men. He cannot understand what awaits him in the wide world.": 1, "Although... from all indications he could have proved a serious nuisance. So, yes, I am grateful that you dealt with him.": 1, "Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.": 1, "Although sometimes you can buy them from alchemists.": 1, "Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.": 1, "Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.": 1, "Although it would benefit the Guild more than you can imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good.": 1, "Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.": 1, "Although I would gladly die by your hand, perhaps I could offer an alternative way to read the scrolls?": 1, "Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...": 1, "Although I managed to transplant a few here when I arrived.": 1, "Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.": 1, "Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon.": 1, "Also, like the Nords of old, we embrace the All-Maker. We do not worship the nine gods of the Empire.": 1, "Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two.": 1, "Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.": 1, "All that remains now is chasing them down, and bringing them to justice.": 1, "Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!": 1, "Almost there.": 1, "All you ever do is complain about what you want. You're a spoiled baby.": 1, "All will happen as it has been foretold.": 1, "All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?": 1, "All we can do now is rebuild.": 1, "All troops, repel the invaders! Show no mercy!": 1, "All those things had been building for a while. You have no idea how long I wanted to say that to her.": 1, "All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit.": 1, "All this walking... I wish there was a silt strider around here.": 1, "All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!": 1, "All this talk of Elder Scrolls and Auriel's Bow... Lord Harkon's ambition truly is great.": 1, "All this talk is making me thirsty. Perhaps another Vigilant will wander in soon.": 1, "All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.": 1, "All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you.": 1, "All you had to do was keep away. What a pity.": 1, "All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed.": 1, "All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.": 1, "All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no.": 1, "All the wood furniture in this inn is rotting to the core. Do you know why that is, Kleppr?": 1, "All the time.": 1, "All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.": 1, "All the miners, farmers, and laborers in the Reach get their daily wages through us.": 1, "All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed.": 1, "All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again. ": 1, "All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!": 1, "All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.": 1, "All that treasure!": 1, "All that the Skaal need can be found in the land and the water.": 1, "All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.": 1, "All these younglings scampering around.": 1, "Almost...": 1, "All you need to do is ask and we can both come out of this smellin' like a rose.": 1, "All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law.": 1, "Almost there! We're so close!": 1, "Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble.": 1, "Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind.": 1, "Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.": 1, "Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here.": 1, "Almost as much as we like killing them.": 1, "Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin.": 1, "Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.": 1, "Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation.": 1, "Allow me to introduce myself. I am the bard Llewellyn, known as \"The Nightingale\". Your steward has arranged for me to take service with you.": 1, "Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you.": 1, "Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!": 1, "Allow me to gather some of my things and I'll head back to Castle Volkihar.": 1, "All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent. ": 1, "Allow me to apologize for Crescius's behavior, I'm afraid he hasn't been himself lately.": 1, "All-Maker, guide my eyes and ears.": 1, "All-Maker, I am prepared to return...": 1, "All-Maker willing, young Nikulas will take an interest. I would be happy to teach him.": 1, "All-Maker shelter you.": 1, "All-Maker protect me!": 1, "All-Maker preserve us!": 1, "All-Maker help us!": 1, "All-Maker guide you.": 1, "All-Maker bless you, friend of the Skaal.": 1, "All-Maker bless you! You have saved us!": 1, "All your drinks are watered down, Kleppr. You aren't fooling me, and you know Lisbet can't afford to pay me enough for the finest drinks anyhow.": 1, "All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...": 1, "All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.": 1, "All-Maker, please help him!": 1, "I bet she'll talk to you, too.": 1, "Balgruuf won't give us a straight answer.": 1, "Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?": 1, "Come back to me when you have something useful.": 1, "Come back to me if you change your mind.": 1, "Come back to gloat? I've been beaten by worse than you.": 1, "Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.": 1, "Come back in a few nights when the wedding reception is over and we'll start the ceremony when you do.": 1, "Come back if you're feeling thirsty. I'll set you up right.": 1, "Come back if you want to play tag.": 1, "Come back if you need steel.": 1, "Come back if you need a new ring or necklace.": 1, "Come back anytime, my doors are always open.": 1, "Come back anytime if you need a remedy.": 1, "Come back and see us again.": 1, "Come back and see us again!": 1, "Come back when you actually have the gold.": 1, "Come at me. You couldn't hurt me if you wanted to.": 1, "Come and see me again sometime. I might have some use for you.": 1, "Come and face your destruction!": 1, "Come and face me, then!": 1, "Come and browse my fine selection! Everything's fresh and delicious!": 1, "Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude.": 1, "Come Galmar, we have much to do.": 1, "Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.": 1, "Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires.": 1, "Coast has been dangerous lately... lot of Reavers about. I've heard they're searching for the treasure of Haknir Death-Brand, the pirate king.": 1, "Clumsy oaf!": 1, "Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.": 1, "Close the door.": 1, "Close the door, then we can talk.": 1, "Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.": 1, "Climb on in the boat and get comfortable.": 1, "Come back when you do.": 1, "Come back when you need more meat. Bring gold.": 1, "Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk. Hmm?": 1, "Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?": 1, "Come now, you think you stand a chance against me?": 1, "Come now, where's your sense of propriety? Extorting an old man like this.": 1, "Come now, there is no need to hide.": 1, "Come now, my friend. Haven't we played this game long enough? Untie me, and we can all go our separate ways.": 1, "Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.": 1, "Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad.": 1, "Come now, and hear my proclamation.": 1, "Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.": 1, "Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another.": 1, "A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth.": 1, "Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break.": 1, "Come back when you figure out how to spend money.": 1, "Come in and shut the door.": 1, "Come forward. You have nothing to fear here.": 1, "Come find me if you decide to reconsider my request.": 1, "Come down here and fight, you coward!": 1, "Come coward, now we fight!": 1, "Come closer!": 1, "Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.": 1, "Come by Belethor's shop, at the market. I'm sure we've got something you need.": 1, "Come back! Wake up!": 1, "Come back whenever you need something.": 1, "Come back when you've got the gold, then.": 1, "Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.": 1, "Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.": 1, "Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days.": 1, "Come here. Let me see your face.": 1, "A priest in their order, highly esteemed and very powerful.": 1, "Climb on in and let's get this over with.": 1, "Clever. To think, now I could... Well, never mind.": 1, "Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times.": 1, "Child, my life ended long before you were born!": 1, "Chief smart. Most Riekling dumb but chief smart.": 1, "Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!": 1, "Check your map.": 1, "Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.": 1, "Check the shipments Lisbet says. \"There are no shipments\" I says.": 1, "Charmed.": 1, "Changed your mind? You ready to pledge your blood and honor for Skyrim's freedom?": 1, "Changed your mind? Well, I can't give up so easily. I'm heading back.": 1, "Changed your mind? Ready to find out the truth about Markarth?": 1, "Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?": 1, "A pristine copy of my first volume. Only one in print, actually.": 1, "Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful.": 1, "Changed your mind? Come with me. I'm heading to Riverwood. It's just up the road and my uncle Alvor is the blacksmith there.": 1, "Changed your mind I hope?": 1, "Changed the linens myself. They're fresh.": 1, "Change it? I can remake your face, if that's what you desire.": 1, "Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.": 1, "Certainly. Where can I find this castle?": 1, "A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient... the blood of a pure vampire. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour.": 1, "Certainly. The translation was \"All men must die, often by their own means.\"": 1, "A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold.": 1, "Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.": 1, "Certainly. I can only do twenty at a time, but I see that won't be a problem in this case.": 1, "Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes.": 1, "Certainly, sir.": 1, "Certainly, my good man. Here.": 1, "Changed your mind, huh? The Dawnguard could use somebody like you.": 1, "Climb on and we will smite our enemies.": 1, "Choose your path and your journey will be complete.": 1, "Chops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!": 1, "Clever try, scab, but it won't be that easy!": 1, "Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.": 1, "Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.": 1, "Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.": 1, "Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key.": 1, "Clear Skies will blow away the mist, but only for a time.": 1, "Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!": 1, "Clear Namira's sanctuary of the undead.": 1, "Cleaning out the forge was the easy part. But those blasted rieklings made off with most of my materials.": 1, "Clean the rooms yourself Kleppr. It's not like you do anything important around here.": 1, "Clanfolk, stop the outlander!": 1, "Clan Battle-Born's got a proud lineage in Whiterun, but unlike the Gray-Manes, we've also got wealth.": 1, "Civilized people don't brandish their weapons unless they plan to use them.": 1, "Chop chop!": 1, "City's got eyes. Be careful when you're out there.": 1, "City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat.": 1, "Citizen?": 1, "Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.": 1, "Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways.": 1, "Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even.": 1, "Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.": 1, "Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!": 1, "Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.": 1, "Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.": 1, "Cicero bids you... farewell.": 1, "Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we could just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?": 1, "Christer?  He's here?": 1, "Chops and steaks fit for a jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!": 1, "City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.": 1, "Certainly, mum.": 1, "Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.": 1, "Come on in. The Silver-Blood Inn has plenty of strong drink and clean rooms.": 1, "Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.": 1, "Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.": 1, "Come quietly or taste the Jarl's justice!": 1, "Come over here. Please pretty please?": 1, "Come out! We know you're here!": 1, "Come out!": 1, "Come out this instant!": 1, "Come out and face me, you coward!": 1, "Come out and face justice, coward.": 1, "Come on... there! I got it, let's go!": 1, "Come on. What are you waiting for?": 1, "Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.": 1, "Come on. We need to find out what's happening up there!": 1, "Come see my collection of Gray-Mane's finest trinkets! You'll not find their like in all Tamriel!": 1, "Come on. We can talk about this another time.": 1, "Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!": 1, "Come on. Put the weapon away. You're making people nervous.": 1, "Come on. Let's see what you've got.": 1, "Come on. Let's go.": 1, "Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.": 1, "Come on. It's just around the side.": 1, "Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.": 1, "Come on. Give me your hand, I'm getting you out of here.": 1, "Come on. Finish it!": 1, "Come on, you're not even trying!": 1, "Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!": 1, "Come on, you can make it. Let's go.": 1, "Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?": 1, "Come on. Sounds like trouble.": 1, "Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!": 1, "Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?": 1, "Come then. See what I can do now.": 1, "Come, infidel, meet your end!": 1, "Come, help me search for Fenrig.": 1, "Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat.": 1, "Come, at the very least walk out with me.": 1, "Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done.": 1, "Come, Legate. There's much to do.": 1, "Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?": 1, "Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.": 1, "Come, Dovahkiin. Nin Yol. Strike me with the fire of your Thu'um.": 1, "A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?": 1, "Come with us. We need to get out of here.": 1, "Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.": 1, "Come visit again sometime.": 1, "Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do. ": 1, "Come to visit this lost soul again?": 1, "Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment.": 1, "Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?": 1, "Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins. ": 1, "Come to mock our shame, like the others?": 1, "Come to me with questions. I know our history almost as well as Vignar by now. Except I can remember it.": 1, "Come to laugh at the grave tender?": 1, "Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?": 1, "Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.": 1, "Come to gawk at the dark elf?": 1, "Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?": 1, "Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?": 1, "Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood.": 1, "Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the \"great warriors\"? ": 1, "Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't...": 1, "Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you.": 1, "Come on, we'd better get moving.": 1, "Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!": 1, "Come on, I'll explain on the way.": 1, "Come on, I won't bite.": 1, "Come on, I think it's over here.": 1, "Come on, I know you're in here.": 1, "Come on, I haven't got all morning.": 1, "Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'.": 1, "Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!": 1, "Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?": 1, "Come on, Beem-Ja. We're going.": 1, "Come on, Arniel. Let's go.": 1, "Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!": 1, "Come on! We've got to find a way out of here!": 1, "Come on! We need to get inside!": 1, "Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?": 1, "Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!": 1, "Come on! Let's see you put up a fight!": 1, "Come on! Let's go.": 1, "A powerful warhammer imbued with magic that places warding runes on the ground to obliterate it's wielder's foes.": 1, "Come on! I dare you!": 1, "Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Come on! Come on!": 1, "Come on! Before the dragon brings down the whole tower!": 1, "Come on then, we haven't got all day!": 1, "Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it.": 1, "Come on now, watch the footwork. Keep your balance.": 1, "Come on now, fight your own battles.": 1, "Come on now, boy, you know what I meant...": 1, "Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.": 1, "Come on! Light the fire!": 1, "Come on, we just need a little elbow grease.": 1, "Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you.": 1, "Come on, at least try to hurt me.": 1, "Come on, this way!": 1, "Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!": 1, "Come on, the bow has to be in this valley somewhere.": 1, "Come on, stoneskin!": 1, "Come on, soldier. Keep moving!": 1, "Come on, show me what you've got!": 1, "Come on, show an old man what you got!": 1, "Come on, she's leading us to the scroll.": 1, "Come on, put up a fight!": 1, "Come on, old man. You should get some rest.": 1, "Come on, now.": 1, "Come on, now, no time for chatter.": 1, "Come on, now! I want those arrows dead center! The lives of your fellow soldiers are counting on it.": 1, "A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.": 1, "Come on, let's take it to Dexion.": 1, "Come on, let's get up there.": 1, "Come on, just open.": 1, "Come on, get up... I need you on your feet.": 1, "Come on, get up!": 1, "Come on, fight back!": 1, "Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here.": 1, "Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune...": 1, "Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf.": 1, "Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river.": 1, "Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk.": 1, "Come on, close the door.": 1, "A pleasure, thane.": 1, "Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got.": 1, "Come on, let's go home.": 1, "Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and... rumors of dragons.": 1, "Certainly, ma'am.": 1, "Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?": 1, "Call yourself a warrior?": 1, "Call upon me if I can be of any service.": 1, "Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take Whiterun. ": 1, "Call it what you want. You don't pay, then you're not getting in.": 1, "Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?": 1, "Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?": 1, "Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore.": 1, "Calcelmo? What about him?": 1, "Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.": 1, "Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins.": 1, "Calcelmo's orders- no one gets through to the tower. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need to.": 1, "C'mon, let's get something to eat.": 1, "Bye, mister.": 1, "Calling stalhrim an ore is like calling my forge a campfire.": 1, "Bye, lady.": 1, "Bye now, miss.": 1, "Bye now, dearie.": 1, "By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.": 1, "By your orders, Captain.": 1, "By you?": 1, "By whom?": 1, "By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time.": 1, "By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal.": 1, "By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition.": 1, "By the way... my name is Serana. Good to meet you.": 1, "By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get.": 1, "By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party.": 1, "By the time the compact had been completed, it was too late for us to even attempt to intervene.": 1, "Bye now, mister.": 1, "By the time Crescius came of age, the ebony mine in Raven Rock was shut down. He took that quite hard.": 1, "Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold.": 1, "Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen.": 1, "Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.": 1, "Can you believe one person came in here and took out this whole camp?": 1, "Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?": 1, "Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.": 1, "Can we talk later?": 1, "Can we really trust the words of this Moth Priest? What if he's just lying to save his worthless skin?": 1, "Can we really just make things up? It doesn't seem right.": 1, "Can we both be chiefs?": 1, "Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?": 1, "Can the sawmill handle those logs? They look a might big.": 1, "Can it be? You've brought me my amulet? Oh, thank Arkay. And thank you. Oh, dear friend, please, take this gold for your troubles.": 1, "Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?": 1, "Can I make something now, papa?": 1, "Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!": 1, "Can I join the Legion when I grow up? ": 1, "Can I help you with anything, Nirya?": 1, "Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?": 1, "Can I have it?  It's worthless to you, but I can pay.": 1, "Can I cound on you to handle whatever smithing work we need done? Repairs, new armor, weapons...": 1, "Can I buy you a drink, darling?": 1, "Can I assist you? You know I live to serve.": 1, "Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks...": 1, "Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind...": 1, "Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.": 1, "Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?": 1, "Came all the way out here to see us, did you?": 1, "Calm yourself, Hilund. There's plenty of time for that. Solstheim isn't going anywhere.": 1, "Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield.": 1, "Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?": 1, "Can you believe that fool had the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire in the plaza?": 1, "By the nine! I've never seen anything like this. They appear to be platforms made entirely of magical force. Absolutely remarkable!": 1, "By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!": 1, "By the blood...": 1, "By the blood of my ancestors...": 1, "By the blood of Boethiah.": 1, "By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.": 1, "By the Twin Moons...": 1, "By the Nine...": 1, "By the Nine!": 1, "By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years.": 1, "By the Hist, what a sight....": 1, "By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week.": 1, "By the Eight?! What... what's in this?": 1, "By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault.": 1, "By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets? ": 1, "By the divines! It's as if my eyes have been opened! I am blinded by the light of your majesty. I... I must obey you.": 1, "By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?": 1, "By the Divines... you're infected. What are you doing here?": 1, "By the Divines, this couldn't get much worse. This is more than you and I can handle.": 1, "By the Divines, the Forsworn are here in the city!": 1, "By the Code of Malacath, you must pay bloodprice for your crimes. Which will it be, blood or gold?": 1, "By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now.": 1, "By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this.": 1, "By the All-Maker, yes! That is the very one! I can only assume you took this from Ancarion's corpse.": 1, "By the All-Maker, why?": 1, "By the All-Maker, please let my wife and daughter be safe.": 1, "By the All-Maker, no! It cannot be!": 1, "By the All-Maker, I hope you are here to release me.": 1, "By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old.": 1, "By order of the Jarl, stop right there!": 1, "By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!": 1, "By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter.": 1, "By the fires of Red Mountain!": 1, "By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...": 1, "By the gods... what was that?": 1, "A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that.": 1, "By the gods... I can't believe...": 1, "By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...": 1, "A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek. I wonder what it means.": 1, "A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?": 1, "A sale? To attract new customers? Camilla, everyone in Riverwood already shops here. There are no more customers.": 1, "A savior?": 1, "A secret the East Empire Company swept under the rug two centuries ago.": 1, "A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.": 1, "By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!": 1, "By the gods, the blood! The blood!": 1, "By the gods, that man nearly killed me. You saved my life.": 1, "A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.": 1, "By the gods, stop toying with me and do it!": 1, "A servant? Enlisting in the Stormcloaks? Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh.": 1, "By the gods, my ears...": 1, "A shame it had to come to that.": 1, "A shame. Perhaps another time then.": 1, "By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain.": 1, "By the gods, did that really just happen?!": 1, "By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut.": 1, "By the gods! What are you doing here?": 1, "By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!": 1, "By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!": 1, "A sharp mind beats a sharp blade any day. Words to live by.": 1, "By the gods! Somebody help me!": 1, "By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.": 1, "By the gods, no!": 1, "Certainly, good lady. Here.": 1, "A reasonable strategy.": 1, "Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their face in public?": 1, "Careful with those flames, unless you plan on torching something.": 1, "Careful with that.": 1, "Careful with that thing!": 1, "Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.": 1, "Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye.": 1, "Careful now... this area's not stable.": 1, "Careful not to torch anything important.": 1, "Careful here, there's a trick to this. Trick is to not bleed to death. Ah, and there's a lever, too.": 1, "Careful Mirri... someone's in here with us!": 1, "Care to try out a new ring, or perhaps my daughter could make you a necklace...": 1, "Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are?": 1, "Care to have a drink with me, sweet Sigrid?": 1, "Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt.": 1, "Careful with those netches... they may look tame, but they can seriously hurt you when threatened.": 1, "Captain. What should we do? She's not on the list.": 1, "Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?": 1, "Captain, captain!": 1, "Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman.": 1, "Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.": 1, "Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.": 1, "Captain Veleth, I haven't seen you or your men visiting the Temple.": 1, "Captain Veleth's mentioned how valuable you've become to the Redoran Guard. The Councilor and I appreciate your assistance.": 1, "Captain Veleth! Good to see you again. What can I get you?": 1, "Captain Lonely-Gale, it's always a pleasure to see you.": 1, "Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!": 1, "Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it.": 1, "Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty.": 1, "Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good.": 1, "Captain. What should we do? He's not on the list.": 1, "Capable as she may be, I don't see any signs of her being this, what, \"Dragonborn.\"": 1, "Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.": 1, "Careful, here. If you fall down that thing I'm going to have to drag you out of... wherever it leads.": 1, "Certainly! Glad to see you have the task well at hand.": 1, "Certainly you don't believe such things?": 1, "Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that.": 1, "Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.": 1, "Certainly not! Doing so would interfere with whatever is going on, and I would be unable to see how this all turns out.": 1, "Certainly not enough to devolve them into the sad and twisted beings they've become.": 1, "Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?": 1, "Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.": 1, "Centuries of preparation will not fall to ruin because of you!": 1, "Cedran said he'd... what am I paying you for? Next time, you bring the shipment in yourself.": 1, "Cease your flight and we will move on to the next lesson.": 1, "Caves? Oh, no. The Chantry encompasses far more than a few caves, as you'll soon discover.": 1, "Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?": 1, "Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.": 1, "Catchy, isn't it?": 1, "Casting off!": 1, "Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories.": 1, "Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit.": 1, "Carrots? Really? Okay...": 1, "Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.": 1, "Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet.": 1, "Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide.": 1, "Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.": 1, "Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.": 1, "Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts.": 1, "Careful, now. Wouldn't want someone to get... burned.": 1, "Careful, it looks like something's lived here recently.": 1, "Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "Castle looks so big from down here. I mean, it is big, but, well, even bigger.": 1, "Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?": 1, "Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, \"Dragonborn.\"": 1, "Candy! Get your King Olaf's Festival candy!": 1, "Can't believe anyone was dumb enough to mistake you for a Forsworn agent.": 1, "Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now.": 1, "Can't believe Madanach is on the loose again. I hope those rumors I'm hearing about your part in that are wrong.": 1, "Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back.": 1, "Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!": 1, "Can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!": 1, "Can you? You have the power of the Voice? Now I'm interested.": 1, "Can you? Of course you can. What took you so long to ask?": 1, "Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?": 1, "Can you tell me more about what you saw?": 1, "Can you spare any coin?": 1, "Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself...": 1, "Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?": 1, "Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.": 1, "Can you make some new poultices for my...you know?": 1, "Can you imagine what Markarth must have looked like when the dwarves were living here? I can't even begin to imagine.": 1, "Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?": 1, "Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?": 1, "Can you imagine it? A world without a sun... we would all have been doomed, vampires and men alike.": 1, "Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?": 1, "Can you help me? He's in the tomb doing Gods know what with my dead relatives.": 1, "Can you hear me? Do you have any free will left, or are you completely under this outside influence like the others?": 1, "Can you get it open?": 1, "Can you feel the power of the ancient blood coursing through your veins?": 1, "Can you feel it? You're now so much more than you were before.": 1, "Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?": 1, "Can you close up the stand early today, mama?": 1, "Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places.": 1, "Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here...": 1, "Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'.": 1, "Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.": 1, "Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.": 1, "Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always.": 1, "Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.": 1, "Can't you tell your own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were open.": 1, "Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.": 1, "Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?": 1, "Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?": 1, "Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient.": 1, "Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.": 1, "Can't wait to get out of here.": 1, "A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.": 1, "Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.": 1, "Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.": 1, "Can't talk too much, I'm afraid.": 1, "Can't catch me!": 1, "Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.": 1, "Can't say I'm surprised.": 1, "Can't say I'm surprised with the way things have been going around here.": 1, "Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies.": 1, "Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them.": 1, "Can't say I'd mind heading out of here. I still need to get paid, of course.": 1, "Can't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.": 1, "Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.": 1, "Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.": 1, "Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too.": 1, "Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.": 1, "Can't help you, friend. I might remember better if my pockets weren't so light.": 1, "Can't have a meal without meat. Come and get some here.": 1, "Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with.": 1, "Can't say that I have.": 1, "By order of the Jarl, I command you to halt!": 1, "Come, taste darkness's embrace!": 1, "Come. Face your end.": 1, "Did you find all of the vessels?": 1, "Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.": 1, "Did you fill those soul gems like I asked you?": 1, "Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?": 1, "Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?": 1, "Did you do everything I said, Shadr?": 1, "Did you clean the linens, yet?": 1, "A noble cause. Arkay likes the idea very much, so I'm happy to help.": 1, "Did you bring anything? The pain...": 1, "Did you at least find out what the vampires were looking for in there?": 1, "Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all.": 1, "Did you actually learn what you needed to know by reading that Black Book?": 1, "Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?": 1, "Did you find any evidence at Severin Manor yet?": 1, "Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.": 1, "Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.": 1, "Did something happen to it?": 1, "Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?": 1, "Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?": 1, "Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet.": 1, "Did she really run off and do this? For me?": 1, "Did my worthless husband send you?": 1, "Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you.": 1, "Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?": 1, "Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?": 1, "Did anyone else hear that?": 1, "Did Viola send you to bother me?": 1, "Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...": 1, "Did we build that, or did I imagine that?": 1, "Did I start with my ride on the prison ship, or was it before that?": 1, "Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.": 1, "Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?": 1, "A new master. It's been centuries.": 1, "Did you mark it? ": 1, "Did you make something bad happen?": 1, "Did you look over next month's expenses? Will we have enough?": 1, "Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.": 1, "Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.": 1, "Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?": 1, "Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?": 1, "Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.": 1, "Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?": 1, "Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.": 1, "Did you know it was his decree that forbade the Argonians from living inside the city walls?": 1, "Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!": 1, "Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?": 1, "Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.": 1, "Did you just wander in out of the white? ": 1, "Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.": 1, "Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.": 1, "Did you hear? The Hall of the Dead is closed. Brother Verulus isn't the most popular man in town right now.": 1, "Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.": 1, "Did you hear that? Sounds like those Ash Spawn are back.": 1, "Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.": 1, "Did you hear me?": 1, "Did you hear all that noise outside?": 1, "Did you have some sort of official business here?": 1, "Did you have anything to ask before you depart?": 1, "Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?": 1, "Did you have any luck talking to my father?": 1, "Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.": 1, "Did you need something, Colette?": 1, "Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.": 1, "Did I hear correctly, Thonar? Is your brother really asking you to settle another dispute between Mulush and Nepos?": 1, "Depends on what you mean by \"busy.\" I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually.": 1, "Deor, you must be calm. I'm sure there's a good reason Baldor left us.": 1, "Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.": 1, "Delvin?": 1, "Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!": 1, "Delvin, please tell me you have good news.": 1, "Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.": 1, "Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.": 1, "Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.": 1, "Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.": 1, "Deliver your report to Legate Rikke.": 1, "Deliver this axe to Jarl Hrongar.": 1, "Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.": 1, "Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it.": 1, "Definitely. You must think my life has been so strange. It sounds like your family wasn't nearly as fractured as mine.": 1, "Deer. Sabers. Rieks. Boar. Bear.": 1, "Deer, bear and horker provide most of what we need for skins and meat.": 1, "Deep inside, it brings me joy that the Betrayed weren't to blame for what happened here.": 1, "Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.": 1, "Deciphering one of the Elder Scrolls is nothing like reading a simple book. There's quite a bit of ritual and concentration required.": 1, "Decided to show up for work today, eh?": 1, "A note from someone named Calcelmo, in Markarth.": 1, "Decided to give me a listen, eh? Good.": 1, "Decades of loyal service, and he'd just throw me out like yesterday's breakfast!": 1, "Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do.": 1, "Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know.": 1, "Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure.": 1, "Death to those who defile the Chantry!": 1, "Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire. ": 1, "Did I know someone by that name? Someone... Someone that wanted something...": 1, "Depends on who you ask. Some say Molag-Bal himself gave these amulets to ancient powerful vampire lords. Some say this is just a myth.": 1, "Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.": 1, "Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?": 1, "Did I ask you to? Did you hear me say that?": 1, "Did Harrald send you to taunt me?": 1, "Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?": 1, "Dibella, guide us.": 1, "Dibella's blessing to you.": 1, "Dibella's Heart, son, I hope not.": 1, "Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.": 1, "Di kiirre fen alok.": 1, "Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive.": 1, "Dexion said something about that scroll. What was it... something to do with dragons I think?": 1, "Dexion didn't really give us a lot to go on, did he?": 1, "Destroying the head vampire is usually sufficient to scatter its minions, though it's best to destroy every last one of them.": 1, "Depends on who you ask. Some say Molag-Bal himself gave these rings to ancient powerful vampire lords. Some say that is just a myth.": 1, "Destroying the ash spawn has made it safer to work in the fields. Thank you.": 1, "Destroy him!": 1, "Destroy every last one of them!": 1, "Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?": 1, "Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.": 1, "Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks.": 1, "Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.": 1, "Despite the shame, this one can't help but stare.": 1, "Despite the foul beings that infest this place, I'm certain we'll find plenty of wealth to make it worth our time.": 1, "Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.": 1, "Despite my present low estate, I am no beggar. Begone until you have the coin to warrant my skills.": 1, "Despise the stuff myself. It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask.": 1, "Descend to the ground, and you can attack with your claws and feed upon your prey to regain your strength.": 1, "Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing. ": 1, "Destroy the Keepers that are tending them, and it should bring the barrier down.": 1, "Death to the vampires!": 1, "Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?": 1, "Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?": 1, "Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore.": 1, "Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right away.": 1, "Divines keep you safe, my friend.": 1, "Divines guide you.": 1, "Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.": 1, "Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs.": 1, "Dismissed.": 1, "A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.": 1, "Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.": 1, "Disgusting creatures.": 1, "Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple.": 1, "Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches.": 1, "Disappointed is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me.": 1, "Divines watch over you.": 1, "Dirty filching N'wah...": 1, "Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me.": 1, "Dir volaan!": 1, "Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.": 1, "Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through.": 1, "Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald thought it contained some long-lost vampire artifact. It seems he was right.": 1, "Diil...": 1, "Difficult? I am a Jarl. I eat the most succulent meat, drink the finest ale and hunt with the best hounds in the hold.": 1, "Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal.": 1, "Die, you traitorous dog!": 1, "Die, you sonofa...": 1, "Die, you filthy beast!": 1, "Die, you Orc filth!": 1, "Die, ya cowardly lubber!": 1, "Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?": 1, "Die, worm!": 1, "Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work.": 1, "Do I detect a hint of reproach? I am only looking out for your best interests. And perhaps, a small measure of my own.": 1, "Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.": 1, "Do not be afraid. Faasnu. Let me feel the power of your Thu'um.": 1, "Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.": 1, "Do not abandon me to these elves, I beg you.": 1, "Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.": 1, "Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.": 1, "Do it, Listener. Kill me.": 1, "Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.": 1, "Do enjoy yourself.": 1, "Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground.": 1, "Do dogs count?": 1, "Do come back.": 1, "Do come again!": 1, "Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this? ": 1, "Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be.": 1, "Do as I command, and you will reap the rewards. Defy me, and I can offer you only pain and suffering.": 1, "Do I? What a strange thing. It sounds so familiar, and yet I cannot place the name.": 1, "Do I? I was going to say no, but somehow I feel like I do. Does that make any sense?": 1, "Do I trust him? Not in the slightest.": 1, "Do I need to go on?": 1, "Do I make myself clear?": 1, "Do I look like the sort who suffers fools lightly?": 1, "Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.": 1, "Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?": 1, "Do I look like a \"sir\" to you, boy? I'm not a soldier, and you're not joining the army.": 1, "Do I know you? I didn't think so.": 1, "Do I know you?": 1, "Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...": 1, "Do be careful with that spell, will you?": 1, "Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?": 1, "Die, will you?!": 1, "Die, traitor!": 1, "Did you use my good hammer?": 1, "Did you truly think to be rid of me so easily?": 1, "Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?": 1, "Did you think to escape me?": 1, "Did you think to escape me, Miraak? You can hide nothing from me here.": 1, "Did you think the Blades had been destroyed?": 1, "Did you still want me to help you or not?": 1, "Did you see where she went?": 1, "Did you see where it went?": 1, "Did you see where he went?": 1, "Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?": 1, "Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with.": 1, "Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!": 1, "Did you want something? I'm quite busy.": 1, "Did you see that?": 1, "Did you see that madman? A Forsworn agent. Here in the city.": 1, "Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?": 1, "Did you see someone run past just now?": 1, "Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.": 1, "Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town.": 1, "Did you see a Dog out there?": 1, "Did you say an \"elf\" and \"stars\"? I hope you don't know what you're asking.": 1, "Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?": 1, "Did you really?": 1, "Did you really think you could interfere with us and not suffer the consequences?": 1, "Did you really think our threats were idle?": 1, "Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?": 1, "Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir.": 1, "Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...": 1, "Die, vampire!": 1, "Did you? So Ulag didn't make it passed those giants then? More's the pity.": 1, "Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.": 1, "Die, outlander!": 1, "Die, mortal!": 1, "Die, little elf!": 1, "Die, insect!": 1, "Die, heathen!": 1, "Die, dragon!": 1, "Die, damn it... die!": 1, "Die, beast!": 1, "Die, Redoran lackey!": 1, "Die, Grelod! Die!": 1, "Die villain!": 1, "Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!": 1, "Die damnit!": 1, "Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions.": 1, "Die N'wah!": 1, "Didn't you know?": 1, "Didn't you just see that woman getting attacked in front of us? We're closed.": 1, "Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?": 1, "Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!": 1, "Didn't want that lot getting wind of it. Especially my father. ": 1, "Didn't think you had the coin.": 1, "Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.": 1, "Didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon.": 1, "Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.": 1, "Didn't know her. Guards dragged her body away. Last we'll hear of that.": 1, "Didn't even work up a sweat.": 1, "Didn't even hurt!": 1, "Didn't I tell you to step forward? Hmm... Farm boy, eh? What's your weapon?": 1, "Die Dawnguard!": 1, "Come, there looks to be a way out through here.": 1, "Death to the Stormcloaks!": 1, "Death is nothing to me...": 1, "Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.": 1, "Crazy, naked n'wah...": 1, "Crazy person... Something must be wrong with its head, to strut around like that.": 1, "Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?": 1, "Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc.": 1, "Craven fool. This isn't over.": 1, "Cozy little place, isn't this?": 1, "Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now.": 1, "Cowards, every one of them. Running at the first sign of trouble...": 1, "A pleasant journey, milord.": 1, "Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!": 1, "Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!": 1, "Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!": 1, "Crescius is a third-generation miner... all his life, he's lived and breathed nothing else.": 1, "Coward. Come out and fight me!": 1, "Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down.": 1, "Countless dead haunt countless sleepless nights... when Skyrim becomes whole again, perhaps so will I.": 1, "Count yourself fortunate that I'm a forgiving man. Now, be still while I give you the ancient blood once more.": 1, "Councilor, I'm afraid there's been another ash spawn attack at The Bulwark.": 1, "Councilor Morvayn was offering quite a bounty for assistance with this matter.": 1, "Councilor Morvayn was kind enough to allow Rirns and I to live in one of the abandoned buildings. At least it keeps the ash out of our eyes.": 1, "Councilor Morvayn told me to give this to you if you made it back in one piece... and you got rid of General Carius.": 1, "Councilor Morvayn is the only reason Raven Rock has survived all these years. You should pay your respects.": 1, "Councilor Morvayn is House Redoran's representative on Solstheim.": 1, "Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away.": 1, "Couldn't hurt to gather more I suppose.": 1, "Couldn't be busier.": 1, "Couldn't be better. The sections that are being opened up have revealed some huge deposits of ebony.": 1, "Cover yourself. Have you no shame?": 1, "Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly.": 1, "Crescius is convinced it's a story cooked up by the company to cover up something else, but I don't know.": 1, "Crescius, last time you explored the mine you almost fell to your death. I'm not spending the rest of my days as a widow!": 1, "Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored.": 1, "Daar Lein los dii.": 1, "Daanik Kendov!": 1, "Daal...Vus!": 1, "Daaah!": 1, "Cyrodiil is the seat of an empire?": 1, "Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?": 1, "Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth.": 1, "Cut em down!": 1, "Curses notwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not?": 1, "Curses aren't enough, now must I suffer you too? What is it?": 1, "Cursed, not dead. Doomed to exist in this form for eternity. Trapped between laas and dinok, between life and death.": 1, "Curse you!": 1, "Crescius's great-grandfather worked for the East Empire Company. The letters mention some sort of discovery he was sent to investigate.": 1, "Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.": 1, "Curse my lack of organization... I know that book is here.": 1, "Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.": 1, "Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place.": 1, "Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash.": 1, "Crystal....  gone...": 1, "Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion.": 1, "Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.": 1, "Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls.": 1, "Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.": 1, "Cross the bridge at your own peril!": 1, "Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime.": 1, "Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?": 1, "Crescius, you're an obstinate old fool and you're going to get yourself killed.": 1, "Curse these heart stones!": 1, "Daedra take you, then.": 1, "Could you tell your companion to head home?": 1, "Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events notwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend.": 1, "Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine.": 1, "Consider the suspension lifted.": 1, "Consider me your new friend in the north.": 1, "Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.": 1, "Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?": 1, "Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.": 1, "Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared. ": 1, "Congratulations. I hope you have a wonderful life together.": 1, "Congratulations, friend. You've won a well-deserved victory here.": 1, "Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord.": 1, "Congratulations, boss!": 1, "Congratulations! If you ever want to adopt another child, you'll always be welcome here.": 1, "Congratulations!": 1, "Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?": 1, "Congratulations on getting the festival restored.": 1, "Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent.": 1, "Conduits through which the Ideal Masters speak to their underlings and feed on their victims.": 1, "Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss.": 1, "Concentrate. The battlefield is full of distractions. Ignore them! Focus on your targets.": 1, "Complaining to me won't make your pain go away, Oslaf. Go and see Edla, perhaps she has a remedy.": 1, "Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....": 1, "Coming... Mother...": 1, "Coming from one who murders vampires as a trade, I find it hard to believe your intentions are noble.": 1, "Comfort is given, justice is taken": 1, "Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults.": 1, "Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different.": 1, "Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone.": 1, "Come. Test yourself against the beast with us. We all will share in the glory of the hunt!": 1, "Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference.": 1, "Could you move? You're in the way.": 1, "Considering how the Great War ended, I think we need to be cautious about what we rely on.": 1, "Considering the state I'm in, I'd say that option vanished a long time ago.": 1, "Could you get this for me? I don't exactly have a lockpick...": 1, "Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.": 1, "Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul.": 1, "Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?": 1, "Could that be... the Voice?": 1, "Could it really be?  Wow this is what I've been looking for.": 1, "Could it be? Could Ildari still be alive? Could she be my nemesis?": 1, "Could have been my imagination, I suppose...": 1, "Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down.": 1, "Could I maybe, skip the excavation, Uncle Calcelmo? I, uh, I just think you won't need me.": 1, "Cough Cough": 1, "Cough": 1, "Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here.": 1, "Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much.": 1, "Correct. We only numbered perhaps a hundred at the time, so our presence remained a secret to the dwarves and the Nords.": 1, "Correct.": 1, "Cookware, knives and other goods for the home, all at reasonable prices!": 1, "Convince the Jarl of the threat and he'll let you destroy the creature. If not, then do your best not to get caught.": 1, "Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!": 1, "Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been.. Interesting...": 1, "Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self.": 1, "Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon.": 1, "Constance!": 1, "Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough.": 1, "Constance takes good care of us. But... I still want a real home. A real family.": 1, "Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice.": 1, "Constance and the others are nice enough, but I... I want to have a real family.": 1, "Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.": 1, "Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare.": 1, "Death to the Nords!": 1, "Dagon's eyeballs, but you're an ugly one, aren't you?": 1, "Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble.": 1, "Dawnstar doesn't have much of a port, but the miners say its got rich ore veins.": 1, "Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?": 1, "Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.": 1, "Darkness shroud you.": 1, "Darkness guide you.": 1, "Darkness consume you!": 1, "Dark Brotherhood? You look the type. Listen, there's this Grim Shieldmaiden walking the streets of Markarth. Kill her. Now take this gold, and go.": 1, "Dangerous knowledge is still knowledge and therefore useful. Usually turns out to be the most useful, in my experience.": 1, "Damnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?": 1, "Damnit woman, stand aside.": 1, "Damned wizards and their damned magic...": 1, "Damned good shooting, boys!": 1, "Damnable jester...": 1, "Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.": 1, "Damnable ash! No matter how much I wash the food, it still gets in it.": 1, "Damn. That's quite a sight.": 1, "Damn. No way to open this from our side.": 1, "Damn. It's like everyone in this city has amnesia.": 1, "Damn. I'm still low on netch jelly. He might have to wait until next month until I can gather some more.": 1, "Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.": 1, "Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum.": 1, "A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment...": 1, "A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals.": 1, "Damn, just as I was getting warmed up.": 1, "Damn! What the...": 1, "Damn you...": 1, "Damn you.": 1, "Damn you mages! Aren't you good for anything?": 1, "Damn. Well what do you know?": 1, "Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.": 1, "Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.": 1, "A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available.": 1, "Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void.": 1, "Death first!": 1, "Death feeds new life.": 1, "Death does not diminish.": 1, "Death awaits you!": 1, "Dear. You should put that weapon away.": 1, "Dear. You really ought to put some clothes on. You're embarrassing yourself.": 1, "Dear, you really ought to be careful with fire.": 1, "Dear, that spell is making me nervous.": 1, "Dear sister. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.": 1, "Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less.": 1, "Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.": 1, "Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go.": 1, "Dawnstar is full of struggling miners. Sounds a lot like a certain town in Solstheim, eh?": 1, "Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.": 1, "Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?": 1, "Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.": 1, "Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.": 1, "Dead? Well that's annoying.": 1, "Dead? Truly?": 1, "Dead? Oh, merciful ancestors!": 1, "A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.": 1, "A pathetic creature in her present condition, but the gift will embolden her. And her lowly state suits her to being our eyes and ears in Markarth.": 1, "Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.": 1, "Dead end?": 1, "Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.": 1, "Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me.": 1, "Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay.": 1, "Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.": 1, "Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn.": 1, "Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em.": 1, "Damn things are like flies. No matter how many you kill...": 1, "Damn it, not now!": 1, "Damn it, not again!": 1, "Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us? ": 1, "Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?": 1, "Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften.": 1, "Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone.": 1, "Damn it, I lost my page...": 1, "Damn it, Gjalund. You know we don't have that much coin.": 1, "Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.": 1, "Damn him - the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?": 1, "Damn fool. I told him not to go. The Vigilants always had more bravery than sense.": 1, "Damn fool parading around with your weapon out. You planning on hurting someone, huh?": 1, "Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again.": 1, "Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!": 1, "Damn fetcher!": 1, "Damn boot-lover.": 1, "Damn bandits are worse than the vermin that infest the ash wastes back home.": 1, "Damn ash.": 1, "Damn addicts always stealing from me.": 1, "Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.": 1, "Damn Madanach. Damn his Forsworn backside.": 1, "Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.": 1, "Damn Forsworn. Only a matter of time before they hit here, too.": 1, "Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!": 1, "Dammit...": 1, "Dahmaan - remember, Alduin also follows his destiny, as he sees it.": 1, "Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?": 1, "A pleasant journey, milady.": 1, "Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!": 1, "Damn those Forsworn. Think they can kill people in my city? I'll have Madanach's head!": 1, "Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!": 1, "Damn it, woman! I said to leave me be!": 1, "Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.": 1, "Damn the Jarls.": 1, "Damn that man! He is being totally unreasonable.": 1, "Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery...": 1, "Damn soldiers always trample my crops.": 1, "A pint of your finest mead.": 1, "A pity. And words I hear too often.": 1, "Damn shame to leave that lying around.": 1, "Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.": 1, "Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.": 1, "Damn right!": 1, "A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.": 1, "Damn right it has. Demand's never been so high, at least not since I built the new mill.": 1, "Damn it, what am I going to do?": 1, "Damn rebels.": 1, "Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business?": 1, "Damn layabout never even bothers to send his own flesh and blood a letter saying how he's doing. Can you imagine?": 1, "Damn it. Why'd you have to walk into Morthal?": 1, "Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that...  I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then...": 1, "Damn it. No going back that way.": 1, "Damn it. I wish you would have told me sooner.": 1, "Damn it. I was hoping to protect our people by sending them, not end up with casualties.": 1, "Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?": 1, "Damn it. How could I be so foolish?": 1, "Damn it.": 1, "Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us? ": 1, "Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day.": 1, "Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!": 1, "Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.": 1, "Balgruuf!": 1, "By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.": 1, "By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed.": 1, "Both of you were obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too.": 1, "Both my parents were in the Legion. There was... an ambush.": 1, "Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?": 1, "Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity.": 1, "Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.": 1, "Boss says you're to come back with me.": 1, "Boss said to bring you back or bring back your corpse.": 1, "Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.": 1, "Bormah!": 1, "Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!": 1, "Bored!": 1, "Boool eekasa!": 1, "Booneetay! Koowah!": 1, "Both of you... out, out!": 1, "Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing.": 1, "Boo cha.": 1, "Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that.": 1, "Bolog aaz, mal lir!": 1, "Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?": 1, "Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara.": 1, "A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.": 1, "Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us.": 1, "Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here.": 1, "Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin.": 1, "Bold words, Battle-Born. While you're meting out justice to traitors, are you going to deal with the Emperor, as well?": 1, "Bolar, I must ask you something.": 1, "Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?": 1, "Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now.": 1, "Boo tha!": 1, "Bolar and I will tell you. ": 1, "Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south. ": 1, "Bothela, I have a question....": 1, "Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them.": 1, "Brelfik?": 1, "Breathe!": 1, "Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs.": 1, "Breath and focus.": 1, "Break my stuff with that weapon, and I'll break you.": 1, "Break his shield! Hurry!": 1, "Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?": 1, "Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.": 1, "Brandishing your weapon is not going to help you negotiate a better sale...": 1, "Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?": 1, "A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.": 1, "Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?": 1, "Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby.": 1, "A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars.": 1, "Bralsa, I can barely feed myself...": 1, "Bralsa's may be welcome here again, but I still expect her to pay her way like everyone else.": 1, "Bralsa's been nice enough to show me how to swing a pickaxe. She's an old hat when it comes to digging up ebony.": 1, "Braith is a big meanie. She keeps telling Lars 'n me what to do. I don't wanna play with her anymore.": 1, "Bradyn and Mireli... I hope they're all right.": 1, "Boziik, Dovahkiin. Nuz mey.": 1, "Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!": 1, "Boy, did you miss all the excitement.": 1, "A swift death is all you deserve!": 1, "Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.": 1, "Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place.": 1, "Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.": 1, "Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing.": 1, "Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!": 1, "Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again.": 1, "Boethiah inspire me!": 1, "Boethiah devour you. Get out of here!": 1, "Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.": 1, "Blacksmith, at your service.": 1, "Blackreach... why does that sound so familiar?": 1, "Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves.": 1, "Black Briar? How dare you shove that swill in my face. I'd rather drink mammoth drool!": 1, "Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?": 1, "A thousand years from now Skyrim will have changed rulers dozens of times but the return of the dragons, that story is once in an era.": 1, "Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold.": 1, "Bit of a chill in the air down here.": 1, "Bilgemuck run. Prize beast, run.": 1, "Bilgemuck prize beast. You find, he follow.": 1, "Bilgemuck love meat. Give meat, he follow. You go.": 1, "Bilgemuck follow you. Bilgemuck know strength.": 1, "Blast! That careless old fool.": 1, "Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.": 1, "Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion.": 1, "Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.": 1, "Beyond that... well, maybe one of our predecessors still has a clue.": 1, "Beyond asking for you, he never said. Very strange indeed.": 1, "Beware. Miraak is strong. He knew you would come here.": 1, "Beware! Another of those creatures!": 1, "Beware the tentacles!": 1, "Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!": 1, "Between you and me, there's too many of them. Can't trust the lot of them; never could.": 1, "Between you and me, she could use a bit of warmth.": 1, "Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne.": 1, "Between the wolves, the weather and the threats in the south, even a simple task like gathering wood for the fire can turn deadly in an instant.": 1, "Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this \"advisor\" position he has is a sham, an excuse.": 1, "Big swords should always beat little swords. ": 1, "Boethiah guide your blade.": 1, "Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine.": 1, "Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?": 1, "Bo nu. Quickly.": 1, "Bloody tourists.": 1, "Bloody enough for you, outsider?": 1, "Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them.": 1, "Blood running hot? ": 1, "Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.": 1, "Blood of the sick. Blood of the weak. Blood of the unsuspecting noble lord. Savor each flavor. Unsuspecting, delicious prey.": 1, "Blood from a stone, Klimmek. I've been out there every morning. They just aren't biting.": 1, "Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver.": 1, "Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.": 1, "Blind? Yes. I'm afraid so.": 1, "Blessings upon you, traveler.": 1, "Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.": 1, "Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer.": 1, "Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?": 1, "Blessings of Talos upon you.": 1, "Blessings of Mara upon you!": 1, "Blessings of Arkay be upon you.": 1, "Blessings be with you.": 1, "Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.": 1, "Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace.": 1, "Blessed are the forgotten. The wretched.": 1, "Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope.": 1, "Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day.": 1, "Bleed and die!": 1, "Bleed Skyrim dry.": 1, "Bleak Falls Barrow is just outside of town. I can show you.": 1, "Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here.": 1, "Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?": 1, "Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead.": 1, "A stranger comes to our hall.": 1, "Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.": 1, "But I digress. Here's your payment.": 1, "But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need.": 1, "But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.": 1, "But I can't worry about that now. We need the scroll, and she's our only lead.": 1, "But I can't wait to see these drawings. Go on, get out of here!": 1, "But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.": 1, "But I can't open the door.": 1, "But I can see this having its uses. Do you have any elven arrows on you?": 1, "But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation.": 1, "But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?": 1, "But I assume there's some bad news. It would be unlike Hermaeus Mora to allow anyone to gain such knowledge without exacting a price.": 1, "But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.": 1, "But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say... ": 1, "But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior.": 1, "But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone.": 1, "But I also have a miner's instinct that's run in my family from before Gratian was even born.": 1, "But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.": 1, "But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?": 1, "But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering.": 1, "But Auriel should have protected you...": 1, "Busy with the smelter.": 1, "Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way.": 1, "Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.": 1, "Buruuuwah!": 1, "Burn them all!": 1, "Burn the King!": 1, "Burn that little jester alive.": 1, "Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.": 1, "But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!": 1, "Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.": 1, "But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior. ": 1, "But I do know where to find a Black Book that can help you.": 1, "But I know things are said behind my back. Conversations cease when I enter rooms.": 1, "But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free.": 1, "But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.": 1, "But I insist. and with good reason.": 1, "But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain.": 1, "But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?": 1, "But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.": 1, "But I have something for you to do, since you're asking.": 1, "But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business.": 1, "A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.": 1, "But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say.": 1, "But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup.": 1, "But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...": 1, "But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior.": 1, "But I had no idea she had a setup like this.": 1, "But I got used to it. ": 1, "But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.": 1, "But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid fahdon. Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into.": 1, "But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's \"Way of the Voice\".": 1, "But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.": 1, "But I don't want to be patient! I want my dress right now! Father promised!": 1, "But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.": 1, "But I don't do that stuff anymore. Father keeps catching me and then I get in trouble.": 1, "But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone.": 1, "But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.": 1, "But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.": 1, "But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.": 1, "But I do less business than I used to. The Stormcloaks don't like buying from anyone that isn't a Nord.": 1, "But I guess I don't really factor in at this point.": 1, "Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.": 1, "Bura warag faaanig.": 1, "Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine.": 1, "Brother, I think she's telling the truth...": 1, "Brother! Mara's mercy, you're safe! Your friend told me about Helgen...": 1, "Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!": 1, "Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.": 1, "Brother Adalvald had been there not long ago. Said he found something of great importance.": 1, "Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...": 1, "Brit grah. I had forgotten what fine sport you mortals can provide!": 1, "Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?": 1, "Bring your weapons and armor to me. I'll fix it up right.": 1, "Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!": 1, "Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.": 1, "Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return. ": 1, "Bring the wyrm down!": 1, "A strange race, these Falmer.": 1, "Bring the two of them back here, and we can get started on coming up with a plan.": 1, "Bring the Dawnguard honor.": 1, "Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad.": 1, "Bring that cube. We'll need it.": 1, "Bring more gold next time.": 1, "Bring me say... twenty-five of them, and you can rummage through what was left on my cart.": 1, "Bring me another seven of them, if you can.": 1, "A strange thing, to lose control of oneself. We are lucky to be free.": 1, "Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.": 1, "Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.": 1, "Bring it on!": 1, "Bring back this tablet that Farengar wants and I'll be in your debt.": 1, "Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you.": 1, "Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest.": 1, "Bring the man-beast down!": 1, "Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work.": 1, "Brother? Is... Is that you?": 1, "Browse as much as you like, please.": 1, "Bujold. Your second claims that Hrothmund did not yield a blessing to you. Is that true?": 1, "Bujold's just embarrassed, I think. Doesn't help that her husband is one of the loudest complainers.": 1, "Bujold says you served well. Before we were married, I was her second on the first trip to the barrow. ": 1, "Bujold feels so guilty about what happened. Try not to provoke her.": 1, "Building something, clearly. And yet they don't seem to have much to say about it.": 1, "Bucket. Knife. Book. Inkpot. Stone. No, no, no.": 1, "A storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.": 1, "Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.": 1, "Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?": 1, "Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin' you which way is up. Am I right?": 1, "Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?": 1, "Brynjolf's looking for you. Something about becoming the Guild Master.": 1, "Brynjolf's been sending idiots like you down here for years looking for their hideout.": 1, "Brought some soul husks or are you wasting my time?": 1, "A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them.": 1, "Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.": 1, "Brynjolf will provide you with the details.": 1, "Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.": 1, "Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way.": 1, "Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?": 1, "Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant.": 1, "Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.": 1, "Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude.": 1, "A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things.": 1, "Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here. ": 1, "Bru cha.": 1, "Brrrr... Chilly.": 1, "Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary, per se. Let's call it a \"forced addition.\" Forced by what? Oh, come and see!": 1, "Brynjolf's been looking for you. He wants to discuss the Guild Master ceremony. Congratulations... boss.": 1, "But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.": 1, "Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest.": 1, "Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice.": 1, "Beautiful. That shield... it's everything I could have hoped for.": 1, "Beautiful. That crown... it's everything I could have hoped for.": 1, "Beautiful baubles and gleaming gemstones over here!": 1, "Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess.": 1, "Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.": 1, "Be welcome in our village.": 1, "Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to \"insurrection.\"": 1, "Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.": 1, "Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun.": 1, "Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day.": 1, "Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.": 1, "Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.": 1, "Be sure to watch your finger positions. Especially during the transitions.": 1, "Beautiful. That staff... it's everything I could have hoped for.": 1, "Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.": 1, "Be sure to bring back an amusing story of how Ildari died.": 1, "Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure.": 1, "Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.": 1, "Be strong. Fight big ones.": 1, "Be still!": 1, "Be silent.": 1, "Be seein' you, stranger.": 1, "Be seein' you around.": 1, "Be safe, traveler.": 1, "Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.": 1, "Be prepared to defend yourself.": 1, "Be patient, my husband. The crop doesn't grow faster because it hears your growling stomach.": 1, "Be patient, keep the door locked, and we'll get there when we can.": 1, "Be sure to enjoy some of our Redwater Skooma before you leave.": 1, "Be on your way, outlander.": 1, "Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules.": 1, "Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.": 1, "Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.": 1, "Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!": 1, "Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away.": 1, "Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!": 1, "Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.": 1, "Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.": 1, "Because that's... crazy. You do realize who you're dealing with here?": 1, "Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.": 1, "Because that means there's still hope that they might one day shed their hatred and learn to believe in Auri-El once again.": 1, "Because she was being stupid!": 1, "Because of you, my life has meaning again. Thank you!": 1, "Because of this, I strongly believe you were meant to hear the ancestral chorus. Only one way to find out.": 1, "Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks.": 1, "Because I already have a wife, and I wouldn't want to make her jealous.": 1, "Because my king told me to. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.": 1, "Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.": 1, "Because killing her would yield no political advantage.": 1, "Because it's boring. The fields are going to do fine... you don't have to dote over them so much.": 1, "Because it's always true.": 1, "Because he's not hard on himself.": 1, "Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem. ": 1, "Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire.": 1, "Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief.": 1, "Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.": 1, "Because Ulfric needed a symbol.": 1, "Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.": 1, "Because I'm telling you to.": 1, "Because I have no wish to be harmed.": 1, "Because most of the stories end with the Ideal Masters duping the necromancers, who end up dead or wishing they were dead.": 1, "Because you are such a very nice Orc?": 1, "Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.": 1, "Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!": 1, "Be careful men. There's bound to be more up ahead.": 1, "Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.": 1, "Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill.": 1, "Be careful down there, the mine can be treacherous.": 1, "Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench.": 1, "Be always warm, Skaal-friend.": 1, "Be about your business, while I'm about mine.": 1, "Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.": 1, "Be a dear and fetch me another set of Dwemer diagrams?": 1, "Be a dear and collect these diagrams for me?": 1, "Battle-Born is a name out of legend, sung in the songs of old and heard in deeds of valor for a hundred generations.": 1, "Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.": 1, "Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?": 1, "Be careful not to fall on your way out.": 1, "Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it.": 1, "Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well \"they\" live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome.": 1, "Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.": 1, "Barknar insisted we come here, said we'd be safe. He also said we'd be inside the walls.": 1, "Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!": 1, "Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it.": 1, "Bandits sometimes come at night to steal our food. They think that stealing from us is easier than hunting for themselves.": 1, "Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off.": 1, "Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?": 1, "A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else. ": 1, "Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.": 1, "Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.": 1, "Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there.": 1, "Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may.": 1, "Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.": 1, "Be on your guard at all times. Avoid sleep if you can... Sleep is for the weak.": 1, "Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.": 1, "Be careful up there.": 1, "A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it that one needs consider.": 1, "Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir.": 1, "Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.": 1, "Be grateful for what time I give you until then.": 1, "Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.": 1, "Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.": 1, "Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one.": 1, "Be cautious, friend. The ash spawn are soulless beings with no regard for compassion.": 1, "Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.": 1, "Be careful. They're faster than you'd think.": 1, "Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.": 1, "Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.": 1, "Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily.": 1, "Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.": 1, "Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite.": 1, "Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous.": 1, "Be careful, if the Severin's have betrayed us, then they'll be well-armed.": 1, "Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving.": 1, "Be careful, and keep my daughter safe.": 1, "Be careful, Thane.": 1, "Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered.": 1, "Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back.": 1, "Be careful! That murderer could be anywhere, and anyone.": 1, "Be careful with those crystals. They feel... hungry.": 1, "Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.": 1, "Be careful who you trust. Not all of us have the court's best interests at heart.": 1, "Be careful who you talk to.": 1, "Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something...": 1, "Be careful, this General Carius sounds out of his mind.": 1, "Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after.": 1, "Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.": 1, "Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake.": 1, "Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon.": 1, "Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool.": 1, "Besides, that pickaxe hasn't done me any good in years. Maybe you can put it to good use.": 1, "Besides, shouldn't you be worrying about the damage to the tower?": 1, "Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke.": 1, "Besides, maybe you can put a stop to whatever's going on over there. I owe them a bit of payback myself.": 1, "Besides, knowing how to repair bonemold armor wasn't very useful in Riften.": 1, "Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known to drive many people insane.": 1, "Besides, he can handle anything alone! He assured me so himself. What could he possibly need my help with?": 1, "Besides, Neloth is as loony as a skooma addict. He wanted my father to import a white mammoth. Alive!": 1, "A tragic, and very, very profitable event.": 1, "Besides, Neloth is a madman!": 1, "Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was all a terrible misunderstanding. ": 1, "Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?": 1, "Besides, I'd never work for Neloth! I heard he cut the heart out of his former apprentice.": 1, "Besides, I can't imagine a single place my father would avoid looking. And he's had all this time, too. ": 1, "Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out.": 1, "Besides, Gray-Mane would never make steel for the Legion.": 1, "Besides this isn't so bad when you think about it.": 1, "Bertiflik a goroowala.": 1, "Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.": 1, "Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?": 1, "Belifakathoooookawa.": 1, "Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect.": 1, "Bek.": 1, "Beitild thinks I drink on the job. Well, what does it matter if I do? Huh?": 1, "Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army.": 1, "Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.": 1, "Besides, I don't feel comfortable leaving Raven Rock behind, and I'd hate to lose any more Redoran Guard.": 1, "Being selected as an offering to Molag Bal is an honor. She wouldn't have dared turn her back on that.": 1, "Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?": 1, "Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.": 1, "Better to suffer a wrong than to do one.": 1, "Better to stick together. I don't want you to get yourself killed before we even get there.": 1, "Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?": 1, "Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.": 1, "Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?": 1, "Better than ever. Nothing like living off the land to teach you how to fight, how to survive. We'll have a little warrior on our hands in no time.": 1, "Better than a soldier's pay, so you should be thankful.": 1, "Better not set anything on fire.": 1, "Better men have tried. Let's finish this.": 1, "Better make sure.": 1, "Better in here than out there.": 1, "Better if we don't talk about that. As far as anyone's concerned, we all had dinner at a nice inn along the road, and nothing strange happened.": 1, "Better honey?": 1, "Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?": 1, "Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?": 1, "Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled.": 1, "Best tell the Jarl.": 1, "Best tell Neloth. I'm sure he'll mourn for all of two seconds.": 1, "Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.": 1, "Best of luck to you.": 1, "Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?": 1, "Best of all, Aphia isn't so cross when I go down there any more!": 1, "Best not to damage our reputation. Let your actions be as discrete as possible.": 1, "Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.": 1, "A trade ship from Skyrim struck ice off the coast near the village, and the Skaal took in the surviving sailors.": 1, "Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.": 1, "Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path.": 1, "Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.": 1, "Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health.": 1, "Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!": 1, "Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done.": 1, "Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.": 1, "Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind.": 1, "Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year.": 1, "Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom.": 1, "Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim.": 1, "A traitor right up to the end.": 1, "Before my father became obsessed with the prophecy, mother and I spent quite a bit of time together.": 1, "Before he died, he told the Redoran Guard about the wreck and warned us that it was going to be crawling with reavers.": 1, "Before I let you into Riften, you need to pay the visitor's tax.": 1, "Before I could blink, all the miners were dead and I was next in line. Don't think anyone else made it out alive.": 1, "A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.": 1, "Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill.": 1, "Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you.": 1, "Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.": 1, "Before this, I roamed the skies above Tamriel. I desire to return there.": 1, "Been too long since I've embraced my rage...": 1, "Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.": 1, "Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.": 1, "Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me.": 1, "Been itching for a fight.": 1, "Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.": 1, "Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that.": 1, "Been a pleasure doing business with you.": 1, "Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it.": 1, "Beem-Ja!": 1, "Beem! What are you doing? Stop it!": 1, "Beem! What are you doing?": 1, "Becoming a hagraven requires a sacrifice to their foul deity. Show them no mercy before we become one of the victims.": 1, "Because... I would miss you.": 1, "Been stuck with the name for years.": 1, "Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word.": 1, "Before we begin, I want to make two things perfectly clear.": 1, "Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him.": 1, "Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did.": 1, "Being freed from building the shrine... I don't even know how to begin to thank you.": 1, "Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.": 1, "Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will.": 1, "Being a Jarl could hardly be simpler. You should try it sometime.": 1, "Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order.": 1, "Bein Rotmulaagge! What foul Words are these?": 1, "Behold the power of Night!": 1, "Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.": 1, "Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!": 1, "Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.": 1, "Begone, foul creature!": 1, "Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not.": 1, "Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich.": 1, "Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!": 1, "Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!": 1, "Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months.": 1, "Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it.": 1, "Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?": 1, "Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business.": 1, "Beg for your miserable life!": 1, "Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim.": 1, "Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach.": 1, "Before you even ask... yes, I have the supplies you requested.": 1, "Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it.": 1, "Before you dismiss this entirely, I was hoping you might be able to lend a hand by investigating on the councilor's behalf.": 1, "Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.": 1, "Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter.": 1, "Begone! You're not welcome here!": 1, "By now, my daughter will have told you what we are.": 1, "But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.": 1, "But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.": 1, "But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated.": 1, "But while the Tree Stone remains under Miraak's influence, the natural order remains out of balance.": 1, "But wherever that dragon came from, and whatever it wants, Ulfric will get to the bottom of it. You can count on that.": 1, "But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble.": 1, "But when this war is won, I will have my parade!": 1, "But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.": 1, "But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back.": 1, "But when it was all said and done, those elves were either slaughtered, vanished or gave up and took the dwarves' bargain.": 1, "But what?": 1, "But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?": 1, "But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here.": 1, "But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this \"insanity\" when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice.": 1, "But what of Serana? Can she be trusted to lift a blade against her own kind? Her own family?": 1, "But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises. ": 1, "But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?": 1, "But whales eat razorfish.": 1, "But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?": 1, "But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.": 1, "But we'll put a swift end to that.": 1, "But we never found one. Until now.": 1, "But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.": 1, "But we let that sweet life get the better of us. We grew soft, and...": 1, "But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.": 1, "But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we need the Elder Scroll.": 1, "But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.": 1, "But we had been deceived.": 1, "But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.": 1, "But we choose our own path now.": 1, "But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.": 1, "But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.": 1, "But who knows? I've been proven wrong before.": 1, "But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?": 1, "But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts.": 1, "But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.": 1, "But you may be able to cleanse the other Stones. Even if this does not stop Miraak, it surely will delay his return.": 1, "But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends?": 1, "But you know what I mean!": 1, "A single gyro would be enough, I think. Believe me, this is useful stuff.": 1, "But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question.": 1, "But you don't, do you?": 1, "A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World.": 1, "But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh? ": 1, "But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...": 1, "But you did not follow instructions to kill the victim in view of others while wearing the Dawnguard uniform.": 1, "But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress.": 1, "But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?": 1, "But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.": 1, "But you and I are going to reclaim them.": 1, "But you always say you want more girls in the bar to begin with!": 1, "But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.": 1, "But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.": 1, "But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already.": 1, "But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means.": 1, "But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time.": 1, "But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down and return to their homes eventually.": 1, "But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared \"in poor taste.\" So it looks like it won't happen this year.": 1, "But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!": 1, "But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?": 1, "But why? Why must you stop Alduin?": 1, "But why?": 1, "But you are that man, Ulfric.  You've been that man before, and you'll be him again. ": 1, "But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do.": 1, "But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families.": 1, "But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end.": 1, "But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.": 1, "But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.": 1, "But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...": 1, "But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.": 1, "But then during their war with the elves, we had our moment. We drove the Nords out of the Reach in a great uprising.": 1, "But then Ulfric and his \"Sons of Skyrim\" started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down.": 1, "But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk.": 1, "But their time has come to an end. And you will be the one that ends it.": 1, "But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.": 1, "But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.": 1, "But the way she said it... \"someplace he would never search.\" It was cryptic, yet she called attention to it.": 1, "But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller.": 1, "But the pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And unfortunately, I only have one cube.": 1, "But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.": 1, "But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves....": 1, "But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.": 1, "But the important thing is that I don't have it.": 1, "But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions.": 1, "But the dragons are the most fearsome. Lucky for us, they don't seem to hunt along the roads.": 1, "But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself.": 1, "But the day words are enough, will be the day when soldiers like us are no longer needed.": 1, "But the daedra have no skill for creation, so they befile the All-Maker's workings.": 1, "But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way.": 1, "But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?": 1, "But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.": 1, "But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed.": 1, "But the Daedra are the worst. Their callous disregard for our lives is abhorrent in the eyes of the God of Mercy.": 1, "But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out.": 1, "But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!": 1, "But we all took part in it. Not really wholesome family activity, but I guess it's something you do when you give yourselves to a daedric lord.": 1, "But there isn't any other way through, Legate.": 1, "But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?": 1, "But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?": 1, "But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.": 1, "But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?": 1, "But unlike most, he turned against them. He made his own path, and his actions cost him dearly.": 1, "But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?": 1, "But to invade my home, kidnap my family...": 1, "But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.": 1, "But to finalize the deal, you have to travel here yourself... and most of them never come back.": 1, "But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor.": 1, "But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.": 1, "But those temples paled in comparison to the glory of the Chantry and its wayshrines.": 1, "But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero...": 1, "But this whole thing became a disaster right quick, let me tell you.": 1, "But there isn't any other way through.": 1, "But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you.": 1, "But this is something different. I'd say do what she wants. Take her home, and see who else is in this castle.": 1, "But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.": 1, "But this is not enough. Miraak knows the final Word of Power. Without that, you cannot hope to surpass him.": 1, "But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...": 1, "But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for.": 1, "But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.": 1, "But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.": 1, "But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us.": 1, "But they are for her to use to repair my withered tower.": 1, "But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.": 1, "But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.": 1, "But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder.": 1, "But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking. ": 1, "But this is supposed to be your work. ": 1, "But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first.": 1, "But you said that was impossible.": 1, "But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.  ": 1, "By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end.": 1, "By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!": 1, "By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!": 1, "By Sithis, help me!": 1, "By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?": 1, "By Sithis, I'll see you dead!": 1, "By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else...": 1, "By Shor, what do you want?": 1, "By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here.": 1, "By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept.": 1, "By Nocturnal's grace, I will defeat you!": 1, "By Malacath's toenails, where did that come from?": 1, "By Malacath's hairy knuckles, you'll pay for that!": 1, "By Sithis, what... what happened?": 1, "By Imperial Law banning Talos, we have the right to do whatever we want.  ": 1, "By Azura. A fight!": 1, "By Azura, what's happening?": 1, "By Azura, no!": 1, "By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out.": 1, "By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.": 1, "Buying one of our blades wouldn't hurt your chances, though.": 1, "Buying and selling fine jewelry here!": 1, "Buying and selling a wide range of assorted goods! The best selection in Windhelm!": 1, "Buy you a drink?": 1, "Buy something or keep moving.": 1, "Buy some flowers? Pretty please?": 1, "Buy some armor and live to tell about it!": 1, "Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?": 1, "By Dagon's eyes, you'll pay for that!": 1, "Buuuuraaaa!": 1, "By Sithis, you will pay for that!": 1, "By Sithis.": 1, "By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant.": 1, "A shrine for... Well, it's... I think it's important.": 1, "By long tradition, the elder speaks first.": 1, "By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim. ": 1, "By killing Madanach you've freed Markarth from his hidden tyranny. On behalf of the city, I thank you.": 1, "By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house.": 1, "By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?": 1, "By having the Ancestor Moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize the conduit and share the moth's augury.": 1, "By forging something, of course!": 1, "By ensuring the Chalice reaches our Lord, you have increased his power over them, and at the same time deprived them of their little pets.": 1, "By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry.": 1, "By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.": 1, "By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband...": 1, "By Sithis, you're not joking.": 1, "By all means, show me.": 1, "By Ysmir, you'll pay for that!": 1, "By Ysmir, this will not end well...": 1, "By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true.": 1, "By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!": 1, "By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel.": 1, "By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?": 1, "By Ysmir, Irileth was right!": 1, "By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat.": 1, "By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!": 1, "By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking.": 1, "By Ysmir's beard! I didn't know it was gonna be a party!": 1, "By Ysmir! That's impressive.": 1, "By Ysgramor!": 1, "By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?": 1, "But you shall not evade us with guile and deceit. No. You shall pay for your blasphemy!": 1, "Buuh!": 1, "But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.": 1, "But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment.": 1, "But, if we found it first...": 1, "But, given that something seems to be taking control of the minds of all the inhabitants, I thought it worth investigating.": 1, "But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.": 1, "But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!": 1, "But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance.": 1, "But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.": 1, "But, I will honor your request. The gods know of your victories, and they themselves will glory in your deeds.": 1, "But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.": 1, "But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?": 1, "But, I should be grateful. Here, take this for your efforts.": 1, "But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.": 1, "But, I bow before your certainty. In a way I envy you. The curse of much knowledge is often indecision.": 1, "But, my techniques only work on the living, not those that have crossed over into undeath.": 1, "But your aunts don't even seem to care. ": 1, "But you've proven your worth. I'm willing to try. ": 1, "But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary.": 1, "But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods? ": 1, "But you're not done yet. And you could still die...": 1, "But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this.": 1, "But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful.": 1, "But you'll understand that soon enough.": 1, "But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly.": 1, "But you won't get any better than this from me.": 1, "But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!": 1, "But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, \"Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter.\"": 1, "But you were not placed in harm's way on purpose.": 1, "But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?": 1, "But you... take that out into the world. And if anyone asks, tell them what we discovered. Together.": 1, "But... with everything in my past, I don't think I could bring myself to go into a temple and ask for that kind of blessing.": 1, "But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies, and enforcing their right to rule.": 1, "But, there\u2019s one they fear.": 1, "But... what about you?": 1, "But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess.": 1, "But... we had a deal...": 1, "But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.": 1, "But... that's just not something I'm going to be able to do. Ever.": 1, "But... sir...": 1, "But... she's always trying to be the one in charge, and feeling terrible when something goes wrong.": 1, "But... maybe you too strong.": 1, "But... it's hopeless. I died here, just like all the others. Turn back. Turn back before you become the next victim.": 1, "But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire.": 1, "But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon.": 1, "But... What of Yamarz?": 1, "But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.": 1, "But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about.": 1, "But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.": 1, "But... I... very well.": 1, "But... I'm sorry, you should go. The children aren't up for adoption, and it's cruel to get their hopes up. Besides, Grelod hates... visitors.": 1, "But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.": 1, "But... I can't run the Temple without the support of people who are inspired by the Gildergreen. How can this little tree bring new worshippers?": 1, "But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all.": 1, "But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.": 1, "But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?": 1, "A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all our kind.": 1, "But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?": 1, "But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once.": 1, "But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?": 1, "But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire.": 1, "But, we haven't gotten rid of them completely. A body can rattle around confused long after it's head's been severed.": 1, "But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!": 1, "But I see that new leader's coming is yet far off the distant horizon.": 1, "But that's not the point.": 1, "But that's alright. The Skaal need a shaman and I know that is my place.": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's an Orc want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's an Elf want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's a lizard want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's a cat want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's a Redguard want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, tell me. Why's a Breton want to fight for Skyrim?": 1, "But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together.": 1, "But first, I need some data. Try wiggling them.": 1, "But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a \"he.\" Could be a woman for all we know.": 1, "But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.": 1, "But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us.": 1, "But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal.": 1, "But first, you were introducing yourself.": 1, "But enough talk. Come! Won't you share a drink with me and my companions?": 1, "But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.": 1, "But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!": 1, "But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in their endless search through the infinite halls of Apocrypha.": 1, "But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight.": 1, "But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.": 1, "But don't go there. You don't want these things in your head. You don't.": 1, "But don't draw attention. Some kills are for fun, some for profit. And others are for sending messages. This one is a message.": 1, "But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.": 1, "But damn if I ain't almost sober.": 1, "But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired.": 1, "But bringing something from the Soul Cairn gives you something much more powerful.": 1, "But beware. You are now walking the same road as Miraak.": 1, "But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can.": 1, "But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.": 1, "But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion. ": 1, "But first... dir ko maar.": 1, "But for Serana's sake, I'll assist you in any way that I can.": 1, "But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead.": 1, "But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means.": 1, "But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain.": 1, "But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck.": 1, "But if you draw on me, the guards will put the bounty on your head, not mine.": 1, "But if you don't want to help a master wizard of House Telvanni, possibly earning his favor, you're a fool.": 1, "But if this miracle were to somehow happen, I would gladly return to Tamriel.": 1, "But if they've captured you.... Oh gods, where are they taking us?": 1, "But how would you know it's real?": 1, "But how to reach it?": 1, "But how is that possible? After all this time...": 1, "But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you.": 1, "But his path seems to have been a cruel one.": 1, "But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.": 1, "But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded.": 1, "But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.": 1, "But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where.": 1, "But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life.": 1, "But he is subtler than most of the other Daedric Princes, as you would expect of the prince of knowledge and fate.": 1, "A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw.": 1, "But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar.": 1, "But he hasn't reported in yet, so he can't exactly confirm your story. ": 1, "But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "But he hands all the paperwork over to Nepos the Nose to finish. That old man's back is heavy with burden.": 1, "But have they forced us to change the way we live our lives? No, not at all.": 1, "But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.": 1, "But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name.": 1, "But for now, I need you to be the money. So come back when you can do your job.": 1, "But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.": 1, "But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my family's home.": 1, "But before I send you on your way, you'll need the Initiate's Ewer.": 1, "But because I'd rather drink a mug of mead at night instead of training until I drop, Kuvar calls me a layabout.": 1, "But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.": 1, "But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!": 1, "But I've had some disturbing reports of you... seen talking to General Tullius in Castle Dour, for example.": 1, "But I'm thirsty now.": 1, "But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?": 1, "But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.": 1, "But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!": 1, "But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.": 1, "But I'm not sure I could do that to my father. I think it would break his heart.": 1, "But I'm not just going to abandon what I've been working on here. It's too useful. I need at least one intact dwarven gyro.": 1, "But I'm not going back there. There's something wrong about that place.": 1, "But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?": 1, "But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?": 1, "But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.": 1, "But I'm afraid this is not over. I shall return and take what is mine.": 1, "But I'll see for myself soon enough.": 1, "But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.": 1, "But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready.": 1, "But I wouldn't show my face in here again, if I were you. Do we understand each other?": 1, "But I will heed your wishes.": 1, "But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!": 1, "But I thought you only cared about your fishing!": 1, "But I thought there was only one chief.": 1, "But I think you'll see that the Legion is Skyrim's only hope for real peace right now. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.": 1, "But I think I turned out ok.": 1, "But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored.": 1, "But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there... but you can probably just follow the blood.": 1, "But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.": 1, "But I'm afraid that they're well beyond a cure at this point.": 1, "But before I fought, I had to train.": 1, "But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend to Markarth, and no friend of mine.": 1, "But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier.": 1, "But be warned. The Jarl's guards are unaware of the threat, and will treat violence against this \"advisor\" as a crime.": 1, "But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens.": 1, "But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen.": 1, "But at that point, he'll have everything he's ever wanted.": 1, "But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...": 1, "But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me.": 1, "But as luck would have it, I've tracked down the location of some actual Dwemer diagram drawings!": 1, "But around here, there's a tremendous amount of work to get done, not to mention the dangers she's not ready to face.": 1, "But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?": 1, "But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?": 1, "But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another.": 1, "But after everything with her... I don't think we can trust him.": 1, "But a kill is a kill, and it'll send a message to the Dawnguard, if not exactly the one we wanted.": 1, "But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust. ": 1, "But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing.": 1, "A special type of soul trap. Placing you inside the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back.": 1, "But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came.": 1, "But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came.": 1, "But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came.": 1, "But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.": 1, "But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason.": 1, "But Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising has divided us. Now seems we can scarce look at each other without comin' to blows. Petty and foolish, that.": 1, "But Solitude stood strong, Skyrim's truest protectors.": 1, "But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod.": 1, "But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all.": 1, "But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.": 1, "But Mikael... He sings only for gold and the affections of wenches. He dishonors our traditions.": 1, "But Kuvar's been saying...": 1, "But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there.": 1, "But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will.": 1, "But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there.": 1, "But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore. ": 1, "But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.": 1, "But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!": 1, "But over the years, the ash from Red Mountain poisoned the sea up there and the fishing became difficult.": 1, "But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words.": 1, "But our time here is running out. The few of us left free of control cannot protect ourselves for much longer.": 1, "But our oath as Blades binds us. Paarthurnax must die. There's no excuse now that Alduin is dead.": 1, "But other than that, everything was business as usual. Now, do you have any other painfully obvious things to say?": 1, "But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.": 1, "But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails.": 1, "But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years.": 1, "But once we threw our lot in with Molag Bal... people just don't think about their families anymore. \"Power takes precedence,\" he always said.": 1, "But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, \"elevated\" prices.": 1, "But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?": 1, "But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano.": 1, "But of course, those days are gone now.": 1, "But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.": 1, "But now... we have a clue. Something made by the Forge. Something that can lead us to it.": 1, "But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost.": 1, "But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts.": 1, "But now that they've been destroyed, the light can finally shine upon the House of Reclamations.": 1, "But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter.": 1, "A small test, if you will.": 1, "But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts.": 1, "But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.": 1, "But now it all comes out again...": 1, "But now he's refusing to deliver. Could you perhaps speak with him, and see if we can come to some sort of arrangement?": 1, "But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth.": 1, "But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.": 1, "But of course, neither of us can read it. ": 1, "But now I will be free of him. My time in Apocrypha is over. You are here in your full power, and thus subject to my full power.": 1, "But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get at the book.": 1, "But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand.": 1, "But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor.": 1, "But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.": 1, "But that old bellyacher just fed me some nonsense about light ruining his mixtures and being close to the water... agh.": 1, "But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.": 1, "But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.": 1, "But that day has not come yet.": 1, "But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?": 1, "But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain.": 1, "But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer.": 1, "But ten little cuts...": 1, "But strength doesn't hurt.": 1, "But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.": 1, "But still, this temple stands. The Tree Stone remains tainted. How can we be sure the Skaal will remain free?": 1, "But please, do be discreet. Our aim isn't to stir the nest, just to skin a rat, reminding them that they are the prey.": 1, "But something's wrong. He never looks as though he's in pain or under duress. He just... stands there and watches, as though waiting.": 1, "But somehow they're still here, and they're killing people.": 1, "But she's so stupid!": 1, "But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen.": 1, "But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after.": 1, "But she loved it. I don't know. I guess it's like having a piece of art, if you're into that sort of thing.": 1, "But she is as volatile as a sabre cat. One wrong word, and I've seen her turn on a man so quickly...": 1, "But seriously. What's the message?": 1, "But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us. ": 1, "But remember, you're still oathbound to our cause. Skyrim still waits to be free.": 1, "But remember, Whiterun is home to the Companions. Any dragon that comes here will get more than he's bargained for, I think.": 1, "But remember - you're one of us now, forever. Whatever Imperial loyalties you may have had... that's all in the past, forgotten.": 1, "But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.": 1, "But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.": 1, "But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?": 1, "But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!": 1, "But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.": 1, "But not my own!": 1, "But look here. This outsider has more fire than any of you.": 1, "But look around - there's really not much to join yet. I've only just started rebuilding the order.": 1, "But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?": 1, "But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.": 1, "But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of.": 1, "But let me warn you - joining the Legion is for life. Any previous loyalties... I trust we understand each other.": 1, "But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession.": 1, "But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit... I'm disappointed.": 1, "But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?": 1, "But just think of the advantage.": 1, "But just in case, I'll be ready for them.": 1, "But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty.": 1, "But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones.": 1, "But look... if you need work, Hod can always use help at the mill.": 1, "But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance.": 1, "But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all.": 1, "But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.": 1, "But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure.": 1, "But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.": 1, "But it would have to be very close by. Where exactly did you find this heart stone?": 1, "But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.": 1, "But it was Ulfric. And he did kill the High King, in honorable combat. My brother refused to allow the the Imperials to take revenge for the deed.": 1, "But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?": 1, "But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...": 1, "But it is all of you who are the true heroes!": 1, "But is it safe for you to be here? Won't the Imperials be looking for you?": 1, "But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been captured...": 1, "But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.": 1, "But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.": 1, "But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you.": 1, "But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength.": 1, "But mama...": 1, "But not me! I knew it all along!": 1, "But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us.": 1, "But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.": 1, "But none of that matters now.": 1, "But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir...": 1, "But no, you're content to snatch scraps falling off the Emperor's table. Fine. Take my home. Take my city. May it burn down around you.": 1, "But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years.": 1, "But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.": 1, "But no matter. The greatest artists are never recognized in their own time.": 1, "But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it.": 1, "But never mind that, even though you fouled up the job I still think you've got that spark I'm looking for.": 1, "But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way.": 1, "But never mind all that. We're the Emperor's soldiers. We'll do our duty no matter what stands in our way, right?": 1, "But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?": 1, "But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast. ": 1, "But my book isn't what you're looking for. I'm quite sure it is unconnected with this Miraak.": 1, "But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.": 1, "But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.": 1, "But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!": 1, "But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil.": 1, "But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine.": 1, "But more to the point. Do you - tiny, puny, expendable little mortal - actually think you can convince me to leave?  ": 1, "But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles...": 1, "But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact.": 1, "But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions.": 1, "But mind he bard, Mikael. Poncy little milk drinker, that one.": 1, "But mark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put Raven Rock back on the map.": 1, "But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.": 1, "But my master is dead, and his enemies will pay!": 1, "I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other.": 1, "Ha! I like you.": 1, "I was Jarl once, but I was encouraged to step down when I took sides with the Stormcloaks. It was an imperial plot, I tell you!": 1, "I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential for this kind of dirty, dangerous work.": 1, "I was going to search for clues that might lead me to wherever they're coming from.": 1, "I was going to say the same thing to you.": 1, "I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information.": 1, "I was glad to find out not only the bad rumors were true.": 1, "I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.": 1, "I was foolish to expect compassion from an outsider.": 1, "I was fascinated by her work, and over a period of a few years she taught me quite a bit.": 1, "I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.": 1, "I was expecting someone... like me, at least.": 1, "I was expecting someone from my family. I don't recognize you. Are you one of my father's little acolytes?": 1, "I was hoping it wouldn't smell this bad.": 1, "I was expecting more though, you'd better be good.": 1, "I was done talking anyway.": 1, "I was done talkin' anyway.": 1, "I was considering replacing my heart with a heart stone. Fortunately Ildari offered to let me operate on her first.": 1, "I was concerned about our food stores. Gjalund can only carry so much on each journey, and I'm afraid we might run out.": 1, "I was close with my mother, but she just kept feeding me her opinions of him, and eventually I started believing them.": 1, "I was chosen by the people of the village when our last leader, Skaf the Giant, departed the cold world to join the All-Maker.": 1, "I was briefly in the employ of an orc warrior once. I had to quit because he refused to bathe. Disgusting.": 1, "I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt.": 1, "I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.": 1, "I was beginning to lose faith that any help would come.": 1, "I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch.": 1, "I was enjoying our travels together before we parted company. I'd be happy to rejoin you for no charge... if you're interested.": 1, "I was hoping to feed.": 1, "I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms.": 1, "I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.": 1, "I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest.": 1, "I was one of the Redoran Guard under Captain Veleth's command.": 1, "I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you.": 1, "I was on the trail of something big. It led me here, and... I didn't make it.": 1, "I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.": 1, "I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.": 1, "I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse.": 1, "I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.": 1, "I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.": 1, "I was kind of hoping you'd say that.": 1, "I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.": 1, "I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?": 1, "I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.": 1, "I was just getting warmed up.": 1, "I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone.": 1, "...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight...": 1, "I was just a young girl when Red Mountain erupted. Master Neloth was already old.": 1, "I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit.": 1, "I was in the midst of writing the second volume and they just threw me into this prison. It's unfair!": 1, "I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back.": 1, "I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.": 1, "I was hoping you'd have more.": 1, "I was hoping you'd change your mind. Come on. I'm heading to Riverwood, just up the road. My sister Gerdur will help us out.": 1, "I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.": 1, "I was hoping you would say that.": 1, "I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big.": 1, "I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could.": 1, "I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.": 1, "I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.": 1, "I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it.": 1, "I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline.": 1, "I warn you, Gray-Mane, you are treading on dangerous ground.": 1, "I wanted you to have this. A token of my affection. Don't mean we're engaged or nothin'.": 1, "I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in there, I'm going to go my own way for a while.": 1, "I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.": 1, "I wanted to give you this. A token of my appreciation.": 1, "I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...": 1, "I wanted her to see her homeland before she died.": 1, "I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth.": 1, "I want you to stay away from my daughter!": 1, "I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.": 1, "I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. ": 1, "I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.": 1, "I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!": 1, "I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!": 1, "I want you sellswords out of my mine.": 1, "I want word on our campaign against the Imperials.": 1, "I want vengeance for my wife!": 1, "I want us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that.": 1, "I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times.": 1, "I want to see you when you're done working.": 1, "I want to ring the whole hall with their little spears. Mocking us, from the past. Making us work harder. Fight better.": 1, "I want to make things clear. Markarth has its troubles, but there are no Forsworn in this city.": 1, "I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you.": 1, "I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.": 1, "I warned them. I knew something like this would happen eventually. But they didn't listen, and look where it's gotten them.": 1, "I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.": 1, "I was afraid you were going to say that.": 1, "I was afraid you might say that. Well, looks as though I'll have to prove my mettle against you now.": 1, "I was afraid the earthquakes might have done serious damage here, but the tomb seems to be in fine condition.": 1, "I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.": 1, "I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp.": 1, "I was actually just wondering if you had any family....": 1, "I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.": 1, "I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly deserve a reward.": 1, "I was about to say how impressed I was that you always managed to put it back together.": 1, "I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me.": 1, "I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.": 1, "I was able to salvage most of the latest batch of mead. The rest was... fouled.": 1, "I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me.": 1, "I was a soldier for a time, and then a mercenary, but I was never truly happy until I came here.": 1, "I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship.": 1, "I was a restless and angry child, and Skaf taught me swordplay so that I could, as he used to say, \"put that fire to good use.\"": 1, "I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.": 1, "I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.": 1, "...is there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper...": 1, "...just fed but still hungry... blood... all I can think about these days... last kill was so good... just the right amount of struggle...": 1, "I was a fool to trust you!": 1, "I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago.": 1, "I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised.": 1, "I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!": 1, "I was a Temple priest at the time, and they had me use my healing arts to restore strength to his ailing body.": 1, "I was always taught to avoid these types of ruins. I think I see why, now.": 1, "I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry.": 1, "I was one of the wealthiest miners in town... I could haul up almost three or four times what the average digger could.": 1, "I was paid to assassinate some high-ranking official from House Redoran.": 1, "I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?": 1, "I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before.": 1, "I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.": 1, "I will make sure this gets back to the Jarl. Minus my cut, of course. Consider your name cleared, for now. ": 1, "I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child.": 1, "I will let you know if I find anything in the dining area.": 1, "I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this.": 1, "I will herald the fall of eternal night!": 1, "I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!": 1, "I will have his head for this, I assure you.": 1, "I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well.": 1, "I will not be defeated!": 1, "I will follow you, Skaal-friend, but I must return to the village afterward.": 1, "I will find you. Then you will beg me to let you die.": 1, "I will find you.": 1, "I will find you, Fjola!": 1, "I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!": 1, "I will feast on your heart.": 1, "I will feast on you!": 1, "I will erase you from existence!": 1, "I will entreat Mara on your behalf.": 1, "I will end you!": 1, "I will drink your blood and feast on your flesh!": 1, "I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave.": 1, "I will find you...": 1, "I will not fall!": 1, "I will not go quietly!": 1, "I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.": 1, "I will, I will...": 1, "...go murder a clown.": 1, "I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel.": 1, "I will train better for the future.": 1, "I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.": 1, "I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone.": 1, "I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event.": 1, "I will take you down too. I am not splitting this horde with anyone.": 1, "I will take back my family's castle.": 1, "I will strike like a hawk!": 1, "I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.": 1, "I will share that knowledge with you gladly, master. What do you wish to know?": 1, "I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder.": 1, "I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.": 1, "I will send you back to the shadows!": 1, "I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.": 1, "I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.": 1, "I will say only that we did not part on good terms.": 1, "I will return to the village. When you have the map, please bring it to me there. And thank you. May the All-Maker bless your days.": 1, "I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener.": 1, "I will resist you, monster. I must!": 1, "...he he he... callin' my bluff when he rolls dragon eyes... the fool...": 1, "I will purify the world for Miraak's return!": 1, "I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my name from Tamriel.": 1, "I will not surrender Markarth without raising my own sword in her defense.": 1, "I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me.": 1, "I was only trying to help you, you know!": 1, "I will darken the skies!": 1, "I will be. Just give me a little time.": 1, "I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?": 1, "I was wondering, father. Maybe you should take a day off and head into town. I could watch the inn while you're away.": 1, "I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.": 1, "I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir.": 1, "I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya.": 1, "I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is.": 1, "I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.": 1, "I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me.": 1, "I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.": 1, "I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure.": 1, "I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!": 1, "I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day.": 1, "I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble.": 1, "I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?": 1, "I was simply an addict who needed money for skooma. The stuff wasn't cheap, and murder always seemed to be in demand.": 1, "I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.": 1, "I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.": 1, "I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders.": 1, "I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!": 1, "I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.": 1, "I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.": 1, "I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind.": 1, "I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy.": 1, "I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities.": 1, "...hear he's decided to let the Hags turn him into a Briarheart. ": 1, "I was.": 1, "I was. But unlike some of my brethren, I sought solutions outside the norm in order to maintain my superiority.": 1, "I was. Honestly, it took me up until now to figure out that my mother was really just as bad as he was.": 1, "I will be waiting at Reachcliff.": 1, "I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll. Just tell me where I need to go.": 1, "I will be Jarl someday, mother?": 1, "I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.": 1, "I will await your return.": 1, "I will avenge you, sister.": 1, "I will avenge you, brother.": 1, "I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered...": 1, "I went out ice fishing a few days ago.": 1, "I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school... ": 1, "I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?": 1, "I welcome you, friend of the Skaal.": 1, "I weep for you, mortal.": 1, "I watch the gate. Ain't much else to tell.": 1, "I wasn't worried. Just interested. I don't get to observe first-hand many people who've spoken to Hermaeus Mora.": 1, "I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all.": 1, "I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that.": 1, "I wasn't sure that it was in fact the same entity as this legendary namesake of the central temple. Although the villagers seem quite convinced.": 1, "I wasn't sure it'd ever happen. Here. I want you to have this. My way of saying \"thanks.\"": 1, "I wasn't looking for trouble.": 1, "I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better.": 1, "I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.": 1, "I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home.": 1, "I wasn't aware that Lisbet was having trouble, Cosnach. Is Arnleif and Sons not doing a good turn of business these days?": 1, "I was. I wandered the wastes of Vvardenfell, carrying the message of the Reclamations from tribe to tribe.": 1, "I will commune with Azura.": 1, "I want to make a reminder. So we never forget what happened the last time we got soft.": 1, "I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know.": 1, "I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.": 1, "I thought we had a guard posted outside.": 1, "I thought today was going to be boring.": 1, "I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest.": 1, "I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.": 1, "I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.": 1, "I thought so.": 1, "I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.": 1, "I thought it was painfully obvious that Gulum-Ei was important to the Guild.": 1, "I thought it was finally going to be a quiet day.": 1, "I thought it high time I caught up with you.": 1, "I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?": 1, "I thought we were all dead for sure!": 1, "I thought Lokil knew what he was doing. This is taking too long.": 1, "...oh if I chance to see a cat, I'll feed its corpse to my pet rat... ": 1, "I thought I'd be able to allay the after effects, but I was wrong. Now I'm paying for it.": 1, "I thought I was going to help you!": 1, "I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.": 1, "I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets. ": 1, "I thought I was a goner just now. Thanks for the help, and if you need any supplies I have a few to sell.": 1, "I thought I saw... no, surely not.": 1, "I thought I remembered, but now I'm not sure. Is it important, or did I imagine that?": 1, "I thought I made myself clear the first time.": 1, "I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.": 1, "I thought I gave you something to do?": 1, "I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.": 1, "I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest.": 1, "I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...": 1, "I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay.": 1, "I told you, I know everything about this castle.": 1, "I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse.": 1, "I told you you wouldn't like the news.": 1, "I told you what you wanted to know. What else could you want?": 1, "I told you we should have hired a thief.": 1, "I told you my sister would help us out.": 1, "I told you everything I know. What else did you want?": 1, "I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed.": 1, "I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?": 1, "I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.": 1, "I told him not to head up there. Sounds like the bloody fool got what he deserved.": 1, "I told him he was crazy to even think about talking to those vicious little buggers, but he wouldn't listen.": 1, "I told him \"no\" once already.": 1, "I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.": 1, "I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it.": 1, "I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that.": 1, "I told Arniel what I wanted in exchange for it, and he was unwilling to come up with it.": 1, "I thought... I hoped that if he saw me, he might feel something again.": 1, "I thought you were stronger than this, Kruziikrel.": 1, "I thought you were in a hurry to get to Nchardak.": 1, "I thought you were a wizard. Hit me with a spell!": 1, "I thought you understood how this worked by now. The water level needs to be lower for the boilers to work at all.": 1, "I thought you said you were happy together.": 1, "I thought you said these things were \"sleeping\"?": 1, "I thought you played wonderfully last night.": 1, "I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while.": 1, "I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking.": 1, "I think... mostly I hate what it's done to my family. ": 1, "I think...": 1, "I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments.": 1, "I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.": 1, "I think we can rebuild here. Make my family's legacy something more respectable.": 1, "I think we both know... it's time to face my father.": 1, "I think this might be the end...": 1, "I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.": 1, "I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.": 1, "I think they're gone.": 1, "I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.": 1, "I think they transcend what we perceive as a physical form.": 1, "I think they may be rebuilding themselves while we're not looking.": 1, "I think we have a better chance of surviving here, don't you?": 1, "I think they like you.": 1, "I think there is much that we can learn from each other.": 1, "I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that.": 1, "I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.": 1, "I think the time might be right for another public appearance. Maybe address the patrons at the Bannered Mare? Or visit Jorrvaskr?": 1, "I think the man you want to talk to is Nelacar. He was exiled a few years ago, bad research. Still hangs around the Frozen Hearth.": 1, "I think the key concept I'm missing is recorded in Afa-Saryat's book, Wind and Sand.": 1, "I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords.": 1, "I think the Thalmor are trying to steal my work!": 1, "I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson.": 1, "I think the College is due for a change in leadership.": 1, "I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down.": 1, "I think they got the message.": 1, "I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.": 1, "I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery.": 1, "I think we should focus on how to get up to the door on the north side of the Workshop.": 1, "I think.": 1, "I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree.": 1, "I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home.": 1, "I think you're looking for this.": 1, "I think you'll need to find some arrows, first. Only elven ones will work for this, remember?": 1, "I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice.": 1, "I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.": 1, "I think you'd be a little smarter than that.": 1, "I think you should continue with your performances.": 1, "I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.": 1, "I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.": 1, "I think you might be looking for Enmon. ": 1, "I think you may have wasted your money, friend.": 1, "I think you know. ": 1, "I think you did it.": 1, "I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.": 1, "I think you and I are going to get along just fine.": 1, "...retire some day... get my self a place on the mainland...": 1, "I think we've talked about that enough. Come on, now.": 1, "I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.": 1, "I think we're done here.": 1, "I think we're almost to the bottom of the Barrow, but... it's going to be everything I can do to find more miners.": 1, "I think we'll want Sorine Jurard. Breton girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the Dwemer. Weapons in particular.": 1, "I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.": 1, "I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.": 1, "I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him.": 1, "I told you, I've prepared for this. It's going to work.": 1, "I told you, it's the wedding of Vittoria Vici, an extremely well connected merchant with the East Empire Company. The Emperor's cousin? Remember?": 1, "I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son.": 1, "I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.": 1, "I used to hide down here and look out at the sea. Usually when my father was in a bad mood.": 1, "I used to help my mother tend a garden in the courtyard here.": 1, "I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.": 1, "I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us.": 1, "...just one more bottle... maybe a second one to get to sleep...": 1, "I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.": 1, "I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain.": 1, "I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.": 1, "I used to be one of the best traders in High Rock, you know. People would track me down just to see what I had for sale.": 1, "I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married.": 1, "I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage.": 1, "I used to be a miner, a good one too. I made more gold digging up ore in a month than some people earn in a lifetime.": 1, "I understand. Walk with the All-Maker, Dragonborn.": 1, "I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.": 1, "I understand. Know that you are welcome here for as long as you wish to be.": 1, "I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.": 1, "I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?": 1, "I understand. I know you're doing everything you can.": 1, "I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.": 1, "I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.": 1, "I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later.": 1, "I understand, mother. Forgive me.": 1, "I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business.": 1, "I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business.": 1, "I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch.": 1, "I used to think so, too.": 1, "I used to travel so much before all this Forsworn nonsense. Such an inconvenience...": 1, "I want to hear about this dragon.": 1, "I want to get to my son. He's all I have left.": 1, "I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger.": 1, "I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.": 1, "I want to be on the right side.": 1, "I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die.": 1, "I want to be big and strong like a lion, too. Someday.": 1, "I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't.": 1, "I want to be a great hunter like Wulf. I practice stalking prey on the rabbits and the foxes in the woods.": 1, "I want to add some punch to our crossbow capabilities, I've done all I can on my own. I need a little inspiration.": 1, "I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.": 1, "I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.": 1, "I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?": 1, "I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?": 1, "I want every arrow in the sky!": 1, "I want a drink, not company. Now go.": 1, "I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say.": 1, "I vowed to have your head.": 1, "I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill.": 1, "I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me.": 1, "I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?": 1, "I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all.": 1, "I used to work at Anga's Mill, but I... I had to leave.": 1, "I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.": 1, "I used to walk through here after evening meals. It was beautiful, once.": 1, "I understand, Adril. I know you're both doing your best.": 1, "I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.": 1, "I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?": 1, "I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.": 1, "I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.": 1, "I trust them completely, because I understand them.": 1, "I trust the night finds you well?": 1, "I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.": 1, "I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear.": 1, "I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.": 1, "I trust my parents are well?": 1, "...might pay off my bounty this time... walk into Raven Rock a free man...": 1, "I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you.": 1, "I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...": 1, "I tried to talk to you about it, but you just walked away.": 1, "I tried to look for her, but she never turned up.": 1, "I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time.": 1, "I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?": 1, "...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...": 1, "...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers...": 1, "I tried to court her, but she had no interest in me.": 1, "I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe.": 1, "I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.": 1, "I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.": 1, "I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.": 1, "I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.": 1, "I took that prancing fool into my home, and this is how he repays me?": 1, "I took it upon myself to join the cause and fight the dremora, thinking this would simply be another feather in my cap.": 1, "...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly...": 1, "I trust you aren't considering any... thievery.": 1, "I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.": 1, "I trust you don't presume on our friendship? I am a Jarl, after all. I wouldn't want to appear foolish in front of these people.": 1, "I trust you found your journey to Winterhold not entirely unpleasant.": 1, "I understand what you did for Serana and for me, but the prophecy never sat well for me, and I don't want to be a part of it. I'm sorry.": 1, "I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it.": 1, "I understand that, but I really can't leave here without at least one usable piece of dwarven equipment.": 1, "I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.": 1, "I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem.": 1, "I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.": 1, "I understand Eirid's been playing \"Hunt the Elf\" again.": 1, "I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.": 1, "I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times.": 1, "I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?": 1, "I try to hold us to the right path.": 1, "I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha.": 1, "I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me.": 1, "I try not to think about how my uncle got all the Dwemer Centurion parts.": 1, "I try and meet the needs of everyone here. No reason for any of us to go hungry.": 1, "I trust your journey was successful?": 1, "I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me.": 1, "I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?": 1, "...knew a girl with hair of gold, I called her fair, she called me bold...": 1, "I trust you're keeping my daughter safe.": 1, "I trust you're faring well?": 1, "I trust you'll put your weapon away?": 1, "I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.": 1, "I trust you'll be finished with Fort Hraggstad soon?": 1, "I trust you know what you're doing with that spell?": 1, "...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night...": 1, "I think that's another wayshrine up there. Here we go.": 1, "I wish Elgrim had spent more time tutoring me then that Ingun girl.": 1, "I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want.": 1, "I'll bury my blade in your heart!": 1, "I'll bring you down!": 1, "I'll bring a blanket and some wine.": 1, "I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it? ": 1, "I'll bet my parents didn't know the half of this part of the castle.": 1, "I'll bet he stole it from the Skaal in the first place.": 1, "I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.": 1, "I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.": 1, "I'll be with the Dawnguard if you need me.": 1, "I'll be waiting.": 1, "I'll be the one asking the questions.": 1, "I'll bury you!": 1, "I'll be the judge of that. Now, back to your practice.": 1, "I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.": 1, "I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.": 1, "I'll be sure to put in a good word for you if I get back to Solitude first.": 1, "I'll be sure to check \"Talk to random stranger\" off my list of today's tasks...": 1, "I'll be sure and have everything ready. This is exciting, isn't it?": 1, "I'll be seeing you.": 1, "I'll be right with you.": 1, "I'll be right here if you need anything else.": 1, "...blood... so hungry all the time now... need to hunt again soon...": 1, "I'll be right behind you!": 1, "I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.": 1, "I'll be sure to tell her.": 1, "I'll buy everything you've dug up.": 1, "I'll buy whatever you're looking to get rid of.": 1, "I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.": 1, "I'll explain on the way.": 1, "I'll end your miserable life!": 1, "I'll drink you dry, mortal!": 1, "I'll drain the life from you!": 1, "I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder.": 1, "I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.": 1, "I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!": 1, "I'll do my best.": 1, "I'll do my best, sir.": 1, "I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?": 1, "I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?": 1, "I'll deal with my uncle. Just... go! Scour this place from top to bottom!": 1, "I'll darken the skies with her blood!": 1, "I'll cut your throat!": 1, "I'll cut you open!": 1, "I'll cut you in two, fetcher!": 1, "I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.  ": 1, "I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!": 1, "I'll crush the life from you!": 1, "...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard...": 1, "I'll count to three and then say \"go.\" You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready.": 1, "I'll count to three and then say \"go.\" You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready.": 1, "I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.": 1, "I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.": 1, "I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.": 1, "I'll be out in the market all day, from eight in the morning until eight in the evening.": 1, "I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here.": 1, "I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!": 1, "I'll be here. Don't take too long, now!": 1, "I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.": 1, "I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power.": 1, "I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?": 1, "I'll also assume Vyrthur didn't exactly give you the option to stay your hand.": 1, "I'll allow you to leave in peace... this time.": 1, "I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly.": 1, "I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...": 1, "I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead.": 1, "I'll admit, I don't know that I can trust you, but I know I can't rely on the Vigilants for anything. So we'll have to work together for now.": 1, "I'll add this to the rest of the items. I don't think there's anything further I need from you.": 1, "I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.": 1, "I'll anoint you with the symbol of the Bear, the Sabrecat and the Mammoth. Tread carefully, these are mighty beasts.": 1, "I'd... well, I'd come with you, but I don't know if I can trust your friend.": 1, "I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents \"lose\" another child.": 1, "I'd... I'd really like a dolly. Or maybe a pretty new dress?": 1, "I'd wager that the statues are the key to opening the chamber beyond.": 1, "I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.": 1, "I'd very much like to have those scrolls. Someday I may be able to return them to their rightful place in the Imperial City.": 1, "I'd try to visit my mother in the garden, and she'd quickly shoo me away saying she was much too busy.": 1, "I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?": 1, "I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help.": 1, "I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.": 1, "I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.": 1, "I'd stay away if I were you.": 1, "I'd... rather not get into that with you. If that's all right. ": 1, "I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.": 1, "I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments.": 1, "I'll bathe in your blood!": 1, "I'll be here.": 1, "...but only during... the day?": 1, "...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.": 1, "I'll be here if you change your mind.": 1, "I'll be heading back there soon. If you're interested, meet me at the ruins and we'll see what we can find. Now I'm off to pack for the expedition!": 1, "I'll be happy to assist you if you'd like to purchase something.": 1, "I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.": 1, "I'll be going now.": 1, "I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.": 1, "I'll be glad to oblige. What a touching gesture, to display the symbol of her devotion in such a way.": 1, "...captain promised me a life o' adventure on the high seas...instead I'm stuck on this cesspit of an island...": 1, "I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...": 1, "I'll be fine.": 1, "I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!": 1, "I'll be damned. Someone who actually escaped Cidhna Mine. You're the talk of the Warrens.": 1, "I'll be damned, you did it!": 1, "I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are.": 1, "I'll be back, and you'll be dead!": 1, "I'll be at the market come morning. You better be there too.": 1, "I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.": 1, "I'll be at the dock whenever you're ready.": 1, "I'll be at Castle Volkihar if you need me.": 1, "I'll be around here if you need me.": 1, "I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.": 1, "I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.": 1, "I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it.": 1, "I'd simply like to talk to you.": 1, "I'll feed your corpse to the Betrayed.": 1, "I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet.": 1, "I'll live to drink another day!": 1, "I'll let you live. This time.": 1, "I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her \"Nimhe,\" the poisoned one.": 1, "I'll let you explain that one to the Nords. ": 1, "I'll let them into the house and, you know, show them where everything is...": 1, "I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?": 1, "I'll let him know.": 1, "I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.": 1, "I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me.": 1, "I'll lead those who will follow. And most of these are the following sort. So yes, I think we'll be all right.": 1, "I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up.": 1, "I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away.": 1, "I'll kill you, I swear it!": 1, "I'll kill you if I have to!": 1, "I'll kill you for this!": 1, "I'll kill you another day.": 1, "I'll kill whoever I must, but I will see my plans fulfilled!": 1, "I'll keep that in mind.": 1, "I'll just wait here and make sure nothing foul escapes the catacombs.": 1, "I'll just stand over here while you flip that switch.": 1, "I'll just prepare the subject now...": 1, "I'll just make a copy for myself. It's far too dangerous to carry the real book around.": 1, "I'll just keep two of them for myself. No need for Neloth to know.": 1, "I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you.": 1, "I'll kill you where you stand!": 1, "I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde.": 1, "I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?": 1, "I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls...": 1, "I'll not go down without a fight!": 1, "I'll not fall to the likes of you!": 1, "I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?": 1, "...ale and mead, ale and mead, 'tis the only advice a sailor heeds...": 1, "I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.": 1, "I'll never tell you anything, vampire. My oath to Stendarr is stronger than any suffering you can inflict on me.": 1, "I'll never surrender Skyrim into the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.": 1, "I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.": 1, "I'll never get tired of killing these Imperial bastards.": 1, "I'll never forget you.": 1, "I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.": 1, "I'll need a witness and, well, you see the kinds of horker-brains I deal with around here. What do you say?": 1, "I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.": 1, "I'll mount your head on my wall!": 1, "...and I said to the baker, \"You're not dead! You're a faker!\" But if that's your wish, I'll oblige...": 1, "I'll meet you outside!": 1, "I'll meet you outside of town.": 1, "I'll meet you in Dimhollow Crypt. I owe these vampires a debt of vengeance.": 1, "I'll meet you at Dimhollow. It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen comrades.": 1, "I'll mark it down on your map.": 1, "I'll make you pay!": 1, "I'll make you pay for that!": 1, "I'll make the preparations immediately!": 1, "I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.": 1, "I'll make sure it's sent right away.": 1, "I'll introduce you to Farengar. He can be a bit... difficult. Mages. You know.": 1, "I'll fight anything that can be fought. Beyond that... I don't want your death on my conscience.": 1, "I'll hurt you if I have to.": 1, "I'll head back to Raven Rock and round up some diggers. Once we've got something worth looking at, I'll send word to you.": 1, "I'll give you a single chance to turn over the bow to me. There will not be a second.": 1, "I'll give you a fair price. Not many people headed over there these days.": 1, "I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. Go to Morthal and speak to Falion. He can help you. Otherwise you're dead to me.": 1, "I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?": 1, "I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door.": 1, "I'll give no quarter!": 1, "I'll give it a try, thanks very much.": 1, "I'll get it right this time, I swear.": 1, "...and he says to the man, \"That's not a horker! That's my wife!\" Ha ha ha ha ha... Ah... I love that one... ": 1, "I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...": 1, "I'll get back to court business, then.": 1, "I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.": 1, "I'll forge you a weapon tomorrow. Right now, I'm closed.": 1, "I'll fix you good!": 1, "I'll finish up here and head in that direction soon as I can. See you there.": 1, "I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.": 1, "I'll find you.": 1, "I'll find you, don't worry.": 1, "I'll find you yet, coward.": 1, "I'll find you soon.": 1, "I'll find that Elf. I always do.": 1, "I'll find some way to finish my book.": 1, "I'll find some coin for you. I always do.": 1, "I'll fight you to the end!": 1, "I'll follow your lead, Thane.": 1, "I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.": 1, "I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.": 1, "I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.": 1, "I'll have your head!": 1, "I'll have your head for a trophy!": 1, "I'll have your hands for that!": 1, "I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.": 1, "I'll have you drawn and quartered!": 1, "I'll have to use Talvas again, and he's a bit of a screamer.": 1, "I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear.": 1, "I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.": 1, "I'll have to come back to this place later and take detailed notes.": 1, "I'll have some mead.": 1, "I'll have some for sale soon.": 1, "I'll have food ready soon. You need to eat.": 1, "I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body.": 1, "I'll hang back for a bit, but you're not leaving me behind. This is too important.": 1, "I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.": 1, "I'll gut you like a horker!": 1, "I'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.": 1, "I'll go with you, but when things are back to normal I want an explanation.": 1, "I'll go to Raven Rock and you... you won't mention this to anyone. If you see me there, just... give a nod and I'll lend a hand if you need it.": 1, "I'll go hire a new crew, and some brawny types to keep them safe. Come back and check in on us. Nothing can stop us this time.": 1, "I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.": 1, "I'll go fetch some, Master Neloth. Canis root, right?": 1, "I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess.": 1, "I'll gladly kill you myself!": 1, "I'll give you this warning only once. Stay out of my way, and we'll do just fine.": 1, "I'll head out looking for her eventually. We'll wander the wilderness together. Just have to get some things in order here, first.": 1, "I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it.": 1, "I'd say you've more than earned it.": 1, "I'd say you're either brave or stupid, but I can already tell which one it is.": 1, "I wonder what happened here.": 1, "I wonder what became of Saint Jiub? I met him once, you know.": 1, "I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?": 1, "I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before.": 1, "I wonder sometimes if you are truly happy here, Nikulas.": 1, "I wonder if we will find some answers to what happened so long ago.": 1, "I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed.": 1, "I wonder if this fire pit has anything to do with the riddle.": 1, "I wonder if there is something here that tells the story of Miraak...": 1, "I wonder if the horse's remains are around here... someplace.": 1, "I wonder if the guardian was himself a man or a dragon?": 1, "I wonder what happened to them.": 1, "I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.": 1, "I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.": 1, "I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.": 1, "I wonder how many souls were lost when this ship met its fate.": 1, "I wonder how many copies I'll sell? Hundreds? Thousands? I'll hire the finest bookbinder I can find.": 1, "I wonder how long this effect will last. Perhaps it is permanent as with the others.": 1, "I wonder how long they've been like this. ": 1, "I wonder how long it took the ancient Nords to build this tomb.": 1, "I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.": 1, "...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. That's my boy.": 1, "I won't take no for answer!": 1, "I won't say no to that.": 1, "I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.": 1, "I wonder what these souls do all day. They look... bored.": 1, "I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?": 1, "I wonder what we're up against here.": 1, "I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.": 1, "I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.": 1, "I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.": 1, "I worry it'll never be safe to go home.": 1, "I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work.": 1, "I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings.": 1, "I work the forge.": 1, "I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal.": 1, "I work steel, weapons mostly.": 1, "I work silver, like my father, and his father before him.": 1, "I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.": 1, "I work in the mine, just like everyone else.": 1, "I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.": 1, "I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first.": 1, "I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.": 1, "I work for the Silver-Bloods. Help clean.": 1, "I work for Mogrul. You got a problem, you talk to him.": 1, "I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.": 1, "I work for Belethor, at the general goods store.": 1, "I work at the mill. Chop trees, carry logs, saw lumber, you know.": 1, "I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible.": 1, "I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.": 1, "I wonder... what effect might your spells have?": 1, "I wonder why they only stole Lucan's golden claw. I mean, we have plenty of things in the shop that are worth just as much coin.": 1, "I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?": 1, "I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire.": 1, "I would be honored. Beyond honored to have such a thing here at the College.": 1, "I won't lie - if this were any other situation, I'd put her down just on the chance she might be a vampire.": 1, "I won't hold back!": 1, "I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more.": 1, "I wish more of our ranks asked such questions. ": 1, "I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.": 1, "I wish Orthjolf and Vingalmo would just get it over with and kill each other. I'm tired of listening to them.": 1, "I wish Lokil would hurry it up. I have half a mind to return to the castle and tell Harkon what a fool he's entrusted this mission to.": 1, "I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!": 1, "I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.": 1, "I wish I had a more romantic tale to tell, but I was simply seeking my fortune and chose Raven Rock to ply my trade.": 1, "I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.": 1, "I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry.": 1, "I wish I could tell you. ": 1, "I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.": 1, "I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple.": 1, "I wish I could say it was courage, or skill at arms that saved me. But that would be a lie.": 1, "I wish I could say how many we numbered, but only a privileged few knew that, and they're dead now.": 1, "I wish I could play with fire like that.": 1, "I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous.": 1, "I wish I could help. The scrolls have changed hands so many times, it's impossible to keep track.": 1, "I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century.": 1, "I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.": 1, "I wish I could have said the same for my man here.": 1, "I wish I could have been there to hear the sounds of their screams.": 1, "I wish I could go with you...": 1, "I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure.": 1, "I wish I could say that I did, but without the other two Scrolls, the picture will remain incomplete.": 1, "I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.": 1, "I wish someone would find me.": 1, "I wish that I could give you a reward that is equal to the joy in my heart, but I don't have much to offer one who has so much already.": 1, "I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod. ": 1, "I won't go down so easily!": 1, "I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.": 1, "I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.": 1, "I won't fall for your tricks!": 1, "I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different.": 1, "I won't beg for protection, but I'm not even sure that would work with this Isran.": 1, "I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.": 1, "I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.": 1, "I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.": 1, "I won't back down!": 1, "I won't allow you to ruin years of planning!": 1, "I wished to bless the tombs with the monthly invocation, but I couldn't get the door to open.": 1, "I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.": 1, "I wish you'd stop acting like I've grown weak.": 1, "I wish you the best of luck.": 1, "I wish you luck in finding the verse.": 1, "I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.": 1, "I wish you could just relax a little...": 1, "I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left.": 1, "I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.": 1, "I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.": 1, "I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.": 1, "I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax.": 1, "I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better.": 1, "I won't let you defile this place, foul being!": 1, "I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.": 1, "I would be most impressed to see that.": 1, "I would gladly accept my fate at their hands if it robs Harkon of victory.": 1, "I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker.": 1, "I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.": 1, "I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.": 1, "I'd like to know as much as we can about it.": 1, "I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.": 1, "I'd like to be able to make a potion without tasting iron flakes, you know?": 1, "I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad.": 1, "I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.": 1, "I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "I'd heard stories about the Soul Cairn, but never thought I'd see it myself. So far it's... about what I imagined.": 1, "I'd have to be truly desperate to do that.": 1, "I'd like to offer you a place in my court, as a Thane. It's mainly an honorary title, but there are a few perks.": 1, "I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.": 1, "I'd guess that must be the pump activator up there.": 1, "I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected.": 1, "I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him.": 1, "I'd give you a bow, but it looks like you've already taken it from the rack.": 1, "I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!": 1, "I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.": 1, "I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused.": 1, "I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little joke.": 1, "I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.": 1, "I'd better tell Varona to bring apples and cabbage from Raven Rock.": 1, "I'd better check on Ulves. The kitchen supplies were getting low.": 1, "I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.": 1, "I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that.": 1, "I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...": 1, "I'd love to have a closer look, but those old ruins can be dangerous and I'm no adventurer. I'll pay you to watch my back down there.": 1, "I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard.": 1, "I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.": 1, "I'd saw off my own leg for a septim, but you couldn't pay me enough to do that.": 1, "I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect.": 1, "I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude.": 1, "...damn wizards... not good enough for yer precious college, eh? ": 1, "I'd really just rather get to the barrow, if that's all right with you.": 1, "I'd read stories about the Solitude windmill, but I didn't expect it to be that big!": 1, "...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always...": 1, "I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.": 1, "I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold.": 1, "I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.": 1, "I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.": 1, "I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.": 1, "I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.": 1, "I'd rather not be here either, but I needed to talk to you.": 1, "I'd rather make mead than ugly shrines. You did good getting us away from there.": 1, "I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend.": 1, "I'd rather be stuck out here than floating in there.": 1, "I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim.": 1, "I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.": 1, "I'd prefer not to get into the details, but let's just say our opinions about the current status of the Tribunal vary widely.": 1, "I'd never do anything that could hurt you.": 1, "I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.": 1, "I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.": 1, "I'd bet a fat purse of coin that he's either dead or hiding out up there.": 1, "I'd been waking every morning with my hands scrapped and raw and now I know why. I appreciate what you've done for me.": 1, "I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.": 1, "I'd be on the first ship off of this island if I had the coin. What a waste.": 1, "I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.": 1, "I wouldn't call it that. We've just got a bit of an infestation, is all.": 1, "I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.": 1, "I wouldn't be at Thirsk if I wasn't.": 1, "I would venture out myself, but long voyages and dangerous risks are precisely what people like you are for.": 1, "I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me.": 1, "I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.": 1, "I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.": 1, "I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.": 1, "...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms.": 1, "I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us.": 1, "I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.": 1, "I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma. ": 1, "I would not advise touching the stone again. The effects of repeated contact could be...": 1, "I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me.": 1, "I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here.": 1, "I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.": 1, "...first kill is always the best... the blood has never tasted as sweet since...": 1, "I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work.": 1, "I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic.": 1, "I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet.": 1, "I would have had it ready, but Master Neloth wanted his meal early.": 1, "I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.": 1, "I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.": 1, "I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.": 1, "I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do.": 1, "I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.": 1, "I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...": 1, "I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters.": 1, "I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines.": 1, "I'd be happy to, but your purse is lighter than you think.": 1, "I'd be happy to, but you already have a creature under your command.": 1, "I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.": 1, "I'd be glad to help a friend of Hadvar. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?": 1, "I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.": 1, "I'd be better off with some mead in my belly, but the air in Solstheim is almost as sweet.": 1, "I'd be a fool to turn down a chance of marrying you. I'm game if you're game!": 1, "I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.": 1, "I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.": 1, "I'd appreciate if you don't bother my wife, Tova. She's still in mourning.": 1, "I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken.": 1, "I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.": 1, "I'd also like to not have to smell troll all the time.": 1, "I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...": 1, "I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.": 1, "I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker.": 1, "I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire.": 1, "I wound up here, but... I... I don't know what to do. I miss her so much...": 1, "I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.": 1, "I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.": 1, "I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.": 1, "I wouldn't say that. But he and Ulfric have been at odds for years, and I'm afraid Balgruuf will end up siding with the Empire because of it.": 1, "I wouldn't if I were you. A wizard's pockets can be more dangerous than a dragon's mouth.": 1, "I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I.": 1, "I think that might have been what we were waiting for.": 1, "I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord.": 1, "I think something's... wrong... I...  ": 1, "I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.": 1, "I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet. ": 1, "I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done.": 1, "I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me.": 1, "I met Alain in the tavern, while I was... drinking my sadness away. He was handsome, and charming. He said I was the \"beautiful lily\" of his dreams.": 1, "I merely wish to talk to you.": 1, "I merely wish to respectfully ask a favor of you.": 1, "I mentioned that there was one more danger. Here it is.": 1, "I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows.": 1, "I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.": 1, "I meant no disrespect, of course.": 1, "I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them.": 1, "I mean... as much as anyone. Not a lot. ": 1, "I mean, why would that idea even cross your mind?": 1, "I mean, what do you think my father will do when we bring him the bow?": 1, "I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!": 1, "I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is... deliver a message? How sad.": 1, "I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept.": 1, "I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh.": 1, "I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?": 1, "I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller.": 1, "I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!": 1, "I mean, I don't have the money.": 1, "I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.": 1, "I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College.": 1, "I might be just a soul now, but I'm still not going to give my stuff away. Bring me at least twenty-five husks and then we'll talk.": 1, "I might be old, but I haven't forgotten that a Jarl's first duty is to look after his people.": 1, "I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!": 1, "I must get back to the village. As leader of the Skaal, I'm needed there.": 1, "I must focus now. This ritual is very important.": 1, "I must be on my way now.": 1, "I must be going mad. But then, so must everyone else.": 1, "I must be getting jumpy.": 1, "7,000 Steps indeed... next time they need to build it closer to the ground...": 1, "I murdered others for money. And before you think I belonged to some romantic or secretive guild, think again.": 1, "I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.": 1, "I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up. ": 1, "I misspoke. Never mind what I said. Now get back to work.": 1, "I miss those days, before the Forsworn took up arms again, when you could walk the roads in peace.": 1, "I miss the flowers.": 1, "I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats.": 1, "I miss my homeland, but I can't say that I miss all the noise!": 1, "I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe.": 1, "I miss Varona. She used to help me with the gardening.": 1, "I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable.": 1, "I miss Reyda. She was so nice to Narfi. Narfi's sad he can't be with Reyda.": 1, "I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless.": 1, "I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material. ": 1, "I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.": 1, "I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place.": 1, "I might not trust you, but I will trust your greed. Very well, take the map.": 1, "I might lend coin to people that need it, but I never lend to strangers. So shove off.": 1, "I might know someone. Or maybe not. I can't remember...": 1, "I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you.": 1, "I must get home, outsider.": 1, "I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you.": 1, "I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best.": 1, "I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit. ": 1, "I love it when dinner walks right into my arms.": 1, "I love him dearly, and I support everything he does, but I can't let him chase this silly idea or he may end up joining Gratian in a rocky grave.": 1, "I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.": 1, "I love a good fight!": 1, "I lost two wives to vampires. I will avenge them.": 1, "I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?": 1, "I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!": 1, "I lost my house, my family, my life... and then I lost my mind. How could it have gotten any worse?": 1, "I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going.": 1, "I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?": 1, "I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times.": 1, "I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.": 1, "I look forward to it.": 1, "I look forward to it then.": 1, "I long to taste battle again.": 1, "I lived in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm for years... it's a wretched place full of bitter Dunmer. Let's be done here quickly.": 1, "I live... again.": 1, "I live to serve.": 1, "I liked to explore. My parents almost never let me off the island, so yeah, I poked around down here a lot.": 1, "I like your shop, Lami.": 1, "I like your robes. Are you a sorcerer? From the College?": 1, "I like you Una. You've got presence.": 1, "I like what Isran has done with the place. It's good to see someone else who's really prepared.": 1, "I look forward to our next meeting.": 1, "I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story.": 1, "I love this part of the meal.": 1, "I love weddings, don't you?": 1, "I may sound like a crazy old man to you, but I'm telling you, the tunnels here are solid... they would never collapse like that.": 1, "I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it.": 1, "I may not have potions to block the sun, but I do have nearly everything else.": 1, "I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand.": 1, "I may not be an expert at it yet, but it's good to be back to work and have some coin in my pockets.": 1, "I may not be able to see you, but I can hear you.": 1, "I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's.": 1, "I may have lost a drop or two of blood. Truth is, I'm not going anywhere like this. Hurts to breathe.": 1, "I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.": 1, "I may be old, but I can put up a fight!": 1, "I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules.": 1, "I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian.": 1, "I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it.": 1, "I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father.": 1, "I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?": 1, "I managed to pick the lock and slip out while the guard slept, but now I'm completely lost. Can you help me, please?": 1, "I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.": 1, "I make no secret of it. I don't care if the Empire controls the city or not, I won't hide my loyalty to the dream of a free Skyrim.": 1, "I maintain a few contacts in other Dunmer settlements across Tamriel.": 1, "I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired.": 1, "I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.": 1, "I made a wish in the town well that a golden knight came to take me to his castle. Oh, does it spoil the wish if I tell?": 1, "I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer.": 1, "I love you.": 1, "I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.": 1, "I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.": 1, "I like to think I've aged well. I'm certainly wiser than I once was. And I know when one should speak... and when one should hold their tongue.": 1, "I must have been gone longer than I thought. Definitely longer than we planned.": 1, "I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds.": 1, "I never saw the end coming like it did... the mine running out of ebony.": 1, "I never said it would be. But either way, we have to try. Whether we succeed or not, it'll stir up some of the old blood in this crowd.": 1, "I never miss a good meal.": 1, "I never met her. Master Neloth took me on because she died.": 1, "I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever.": 1, "I never knew what became of Kvatch. I wonder if they were triumphant without me.": 1, "I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do.": 1, "I never knew my father... my mother and I always lived alone.": 1, "I never knew much about Weylin, except he lives in the Warrens, like all the other workers.": 1, "I never knew it would be this beautiful.": 1, "I never imagined we'd find something like this.": 1, "I never should have taken this job!": 1, "I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.": 1, "I never got a chance to thank you for everything you've done. Ever since your mother died...": 1, "I never get tired of that sound. It'll take me a few days to dig up some more laborers, but swing back when you get a chance. See how we're doing.": 1, "I never forget who my friends are. Or my enemies.": 1, "I never fancied becoming a miner... didn't want to spend the rest of my days cracking rocks.": 1, "I never expected... well, suddenly here you are and now I'm too muddled to explain myself.": 1, "I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does.": 1, "I never did understand the local custom of simply leaving one's trash wherever is convenient...": 1, "I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.": 1, "I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it.": 1, "I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.": 1, "I need you to start out by being my eyes and ears... search Raven Rock and see if you can root out these traitors.": 1, "I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with \"the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?\"": 1, "I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.": 1, "I never thought all I would want is peace and quiet, but I think our little adventure scared me straight.": 1, "I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.": 1, "I only know what she told me.": 1, "I only just got my hands on it. I can only work so quickly.": 1, "I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.": 1, "I only hope that you will allow me the precious moments of time there through your call.": 1, "I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning.": 1, "I only had enough coin saved to send one of us back to the Imperial City, so I sent my mother alone.": 1, "I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.": 1, "I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.": 1, "I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.": 1, "I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck... Well, you can see how that turned out.": 1, "I once paid 3000 gold for this fungus that grows in giants armpits. Couldn't stand up for days, but no where as good as this stuff.": 1, "I once killed thirty vampires with my bare hands, you know. Ask Arkay, he'll tell you.": 1, "I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol.": 1, "I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm.": 1, "I often wonder where we'd be if the Dwemer were still around. Ah well. We'll have to manage with the scraps we find.": 1, "I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back.": 1, "I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots.": 1, "I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again. ": 1, "I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.": 1, "I obviously don't have anything here, but... there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key...": 1, "I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now...": 1, "I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you.": 1, "...wait. Shor, you're serious! Well, I... all right then.": 1, "...when I next meet, that fair maid Nelly, I'll plunge my knife into her belly...": 1, "I never trusted those damn scrolls. Who knows what those things could have done to you... just look at Dexion.": 1, "I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.": 1, "I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.": 1, "I need you to pitch in a little more around here, dear.": 1, "I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.": 1, "I need only look for a few moments...": 1, "I need more children.": 1, "I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.": 1, "I need but a moment of your time, my lord.": 1, "I need at least five more, if you can find them.": 1, "I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!": 1, "I name you friend of the Skaal, and I will trust you with the knowledge of forging Stalhrim.": 1, "I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's shadow.": 1, "I must take this back to Skaal Village right away.": 1, "30th of Frostfall, 171. Thirty years ago. The Great War started that day.": 1, "I must speak to Delphine at once. There's no time to lose.": 1, "I need some help with this one!": 1, "I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.": 1, "I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...": 1, "I must rest now. The reading has made me weary.": 1, "I must protest, my Jarl.": 1, "I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.": 1, "I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength.": 1, "I must not fail my people.": 1, "I must leave you now.": 1, "I must head back to the Sanctuary before dawn. I will see you there, Listener.": 1, "I must have misheard you. Did you say you were leaving?": 1, "I must have forgotten. I'll take care of it tomorrow.": 1, "I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy, hasn't he.": 1, "I must return to Markarth.": 1, "I need some more ale, Orgnar.": 1, "I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?": 1, "I need some things for the ship.": 1, "I need you to head out to Fort Frostmoth and check it out. I'm going to head back to Raven Rock and prepare the men for further assaults.": 1, "I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf. ": 1, "I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly. Get moving!": 1, "I need you to examine one of them. Just investigate as much as you can.": 1, "I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor.": 1, "I need you to do me a favor, Dirge.": 1, "I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.": 1, "I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.": 1, "I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.": 1, "I need twenty of them for my current crop.": 1, "I need to speak to you, stranger. Now.": 1, "I need to return to Thirsk.": 1, "I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....": 1, "I need to keep Master Neloth distracted so he doesn't find out what I did.": 1, "I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready.": 1, "I need to get back to the customers. We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight.": 1, "I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.": 1, "I need to get back to Markarth. Here, take this. It's the least I can do for saving my life.": 1, "I need to be sure your child will have a safe, stable home to grow up in.": 1, "I need soul gems...": 1, "I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.": 1, "I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.": 1, "I need someone out in the field, taking the fight to the damn vampires, while we're getting the fort back into shape...": 1, "I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Hrongar of Whiterun.": 1, "I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun.": 1, "I need you to kill Arch-Curate Vyrthur... my brother.": 1, "I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way.": 1, "I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.": 1, "I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.": 1, "A Dreth never forgets a friend.": 1, "I knew it! A secret passage in the dining area just opened up.": 1, "I knew it would come to this one day. I knew, and no one believed.": 1, "I knew it was only a matter of time before your ambition outgrew your loyalty.": 1, "I knew it was only a matter of time before she'd return with hatred in her heart.": 1, "I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.": 1, "I knew it was a matter of time before the vampires would come for us.": 1, "I knew her parents quite well, you know. Bera and Ulfarr were good people, very much in love.": 1, "I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!": 1, "I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.": 1, "I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface.": 1, "I knew it! I knew Arkay would save me. I asked for help, and he sent you!": 1, "I knew I smelled mortal blood!": 1, "I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.": 1, "I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.": 1, "I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero.": 1, "I keep thinking that there's got to be another way, but he'll turn on us both the moment he gets the chance.": 1, "I keep the forge running day and night in case you need anything.": 1, "I keep the forge running day and night in case Lord Harkon needs anything.": 1, "I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles.": 1, "I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail.": 1, "I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.": 1, "I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.": 1, "I keep an eye on their comings and goings. No one suspects poor Cairine. Poor, poor Cairine. Ha!": 1, "I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?": 1, "I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.": 1, "I knew it! Let me see, please!": 1, "I knew it... Mercer sent you to kill me! Guards, there's an intruder!": 1, "I know Varona was your friend. It's okay to miss her.": 1, "I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.": 1, "I know I don't like the way he looks at me.": 1, "I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?": 1, "I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.": 1, "I knew, that day, that it was truly the beginning of the end.": 1, "I knew you'd miss me.": 1, "I knew you'd come eventually.": 1, "I knew you would be victorious.": 1, "I knew you looked like a clever one...": 1, "I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion.": 1, "I knew you had it in you! Arkay wasn't so sure. Between you and me, I think he didn't expect you to make it.": 1, "I knew you couldn't stay away. Admit it, you were lost without me.": 1, "I knew you could do it... I believed in you, and yet... I still didn't think I'd live to see this day.": 1, "I knew you could do it!": 1, "I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.": 1, "I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.": 1, "I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place. ": 1, "I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.": 1, "I knew this day would eventually come.": 1, "I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable.": 1, "I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn.": 1, "I knew that stupid kid would try and find a way to weasel out of his debt.": 1, "I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.": 1, "I knew she was deep into necromancy. I mean, she taught me everything I know. ": 1, "I keep a stable of thralls in the castle should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun.": 1, "I know a warrior when I see one, friend of the Skaal. You have the heart of a mighty bear.": 1, "I just... I just know it. I can feel it in my heart. You have to believe me.": 1, "I just...": 1, "I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.": 1, "A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.": 1, "I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.": 1, "I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.": 1, "I just hope both of you don't mistake my enthusiasm for insanity.": 1, "I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.": 1, "I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.": 1, "I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?": 1, "I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.": 1, "I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground.": 1, "I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things.": 1, "I just hope we weren't too late.": 1, "I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.": 1, "I just don't know if I can keep you safe.": 1, "I just don't feel comfortable sharing that moment with a total stranger, I'm sorry.": 1, "I just didn't know when.": 1, "I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me.": 1, "I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.": 1, "I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...": 1, "I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before.": 1, "I just can't fill an order that size on my own. ": 1, "I just can't believe that Ulfric is gone. Skyrim will never be free now.": 1, "I just can't be sure. I... I don't think I like talking about this.": 1, "I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more!": 1, "I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins .": 1, "I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you.": 1, "I just need a little to get going.": 1, "I just need to be alone. For a while. There's a lot of feelings wrapped up in this old place, and I don't think you're quite ready for them.": 1, "I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.": 1, "I just wonder if that meant it was my job to be giving.": 1, "I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him.": 1, "I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it.": 1, "I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband.": 1, "I just wanted to remind that codger you can't just go around taking things from other people.": 1, "I just wanted to make sure you were all right.": 1, "I just wanted to let you know that Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.": 1, "I just wanted to know if you needed anything.": 1, "I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.": 1, "I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear.": 1, "I just want to see. I promise not to get in the way of the hunters, and I'm not afraid of the beasts in the forest.": 1, "I just want to make sure I'm moving up.": 1, "I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me.": 1, "I just want to go home and read.": 1, "A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!": 1, "I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own.": 1, "I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.": 1, "I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.": 1, "I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.": 1, "I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.": 1, "I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.": 1, "I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock.": 1, "I just need to hire one, maybe two good men. You won't starve.": 1, "I just need to gather some more potions.": 1, "I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.": 1, "I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine.": 1, "I know everyone in Raven Rock, and they know me. You want stories? I've got plenty.": 1, "I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.": 1, "I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more...": 1, "I know, I was late. I'm sorry.": 1, "I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything.": 1, "I know, I know.": 1, "I know, I know, but just... anyway. Molag Bal is the original source of vampirism, and still grants it to his more worthy followers.": 1, "I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?": 1, "I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!": 1, "I know! Arkay told me of your success!": 1, "I know your sights are set beyond this town, but for now, while you're under our roof, I need you to pitch in a little more.": 1, "I know your friends would probably want to kill everything in here. I'm hoping you can show some more control than that.": 1, "I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!": 1, "I know, and I'm sorry that happened. But now...": 1, "I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?": 1, "I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?": 1, "I know you're here. Show yourself.": 1, "I know you're here.": 1, "I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess.": 1, "I know you're all starting to settle in here, and keep up the fat lives you got used to up in the hall.": 1, "I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on.": 1, "I know you will. And then I will give you the knowledge that you seek.": 1, "I know you risked a lot freeing me from Miraak's control. Thank you!": 1, "I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them.": 1, "I know you faced great danger to bring this map to me. There are no words to tell how glad my heart is. Thank you, brave one.": 1, "I know you do, but this is something I need to do alone.": 1, "I know you, champion. The Oghma Infinium was only the beginning.": 1, "I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon.": 1, "I know, but...": 1, "I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I like the pretty lights.": 1, "I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.": 1, "I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.": 1, "I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.": 1, "I like it here at Tel Mithryn. Hardly anyone bothers me. People can be so irritating.": 1, "I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him.": 1, "I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits.": 1, "I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.": 1, "I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.": 1, "I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.": 1, "I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn.": 1, "I leave the honor of pulling that handle to you. I do not want to put my hand anywhere near the mouth of that statue.": 1, "I leave politics to others. I serve the lord of the castle.": 1, "I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it.": 1, "I learned to cook from my father. Ah, but that was a long time ago. Before, you know... I killed him. But let's not talk about that now.": 1, "I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City. ": 1, "I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.": 1, "I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.": 1, "I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.": 1, "I know... I just... I wanted...": 1, "I know. The Skaal will not forget this. Storn's death will become another of the many tales of Herma-Mora's treachery.": 1, "I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.": 1, "I know, you could almost buy a house for that much, but like I said... we've got quite the reputation out here.": 1, "I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.": 1, "I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time.": 1, "I know you didn't know your parents. But if they were anything like mine, you're better off.": 1, "I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become.": 1, "I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to.": 1, "I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.": 1, "I know that better than anybody.": 1, "I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where.": 1, "I know that Tharstan has filled your head with stories, but those stories don't tell of the dangers and hardships of the world.": 1, "I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.": 1, "I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light.": 1, "I know plenty of spells that produce light, but stars? Hmm. There was that problem a few years ago, but that couldn't be related.": 1, "I know our ways must seem strange to you, but the nine gods of the Empire are equally strange to us.": 1, "I know old men sometimes have pains in their legs when they rise from bed. I know a few spells that could help.": 1, "I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get \"lost\"...": 1, "I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.": 1, "I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose.": 1, "I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?": 1, "I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.": 1, "I know it sounds crazy, but it's almost like they're becoming more organized and probing it for weaknesses.": 1, "I know it must seem strange to you, but for us, the thought of leaving our village is equally strange.": 1, "I know it must be hard for an adventurer such as you to understand this, but we Skaal live very boring lives.": 1, "I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere.": 1, "I know it isn't the best place to start, but we know they've been coming from this direction.": 1, "I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories.": 1, "I know it is not my place, but... may I offer a word of advice... of warning?": 1, "I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist.": 1, "I know how that feels. I mean... I know it isn't the same thing. But I was a pretty lonely child, myself.": 1, "I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done it long ago.": 1, "I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her.": 1, "I know he's from the Thalmor, and that he claims to be here simply as an advisor.": 1, "I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.": 1, "I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering.": 1, "I know that in my head. But I just can't help feeling bad about... the way things are.": 1, "I know that!": 1, "I know why you're asking, mother. I am happy here, but I want to know more of the world outside our lands.": 1, "I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me.": 1, "I know what you're thinking: \"This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?\"": 1, "I know what you want: to use your power as Dragonborn to bend the world to your will.": 1, "I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?": 1, "I know what you think of us. You think we're soft, that we're cowards. You think our deaths proved our weakness.": 1, "I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment.": 1, "I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.": 1, "I know very little about them.": 1, "I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.": 1, "I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.": 1, "I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.": 1, "I know this isn't an easy choice. Take your time.": 1, "I know this is difficult for you. I hope you trust me.": 1, "I know things. Hidden things. Things you aren't supposed to know.": 1, "I know things are tough, but at least you have a roof over your head. Please, help me.": 1, "I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.": 1, "I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.": 1, "I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like.": 1, "I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case.": 1, "I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.": 1, "I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about. Near what's now known as Karthspire, in the Karth River canyon.": 1, "I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have.": 1, "I know that... sounds a little silly. It's just the way it's written in the books, and that phrase has always stuck with me.": 1, "I know that. What else?": 1, "I know that it would be difficult for her, at least for a time, but I am a man now. I have the right to choose what life I will.": 1, "I only wish I had a better source for netch jelly. Those creatures are difficult to track down since it's so dangerous beyond the Bulwark.": 1, "I only wish to escape the constant glaring of my \"colleagues\" and discover an opportunity for repose. Your Arcanaeum is so lovely and quiet...": 1, "I ought to cut you to pieces right where you stand...": 1, "I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.": 1, "I suppose she's right. I shouldn't let my personal feelings get in the way.": 1, "I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.": 1, "I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.": 1, "I suppose it's been nearly a year now. My goodness, how the time has flown!": 1, "I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.": 1, "I suppose it is.": 1, "I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk...": 1, "I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.": 1, "...the Emperor.": 1, "I suppose he'll do. He makes dreadful canis root tea though.": 1, "I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.": 1, "I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.": 1, "I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?": 1, "I suppose I've always spoken my mind and tried to do what's best for the Skaal. That's why the others call me Fanari Strong-Voice.": 1, "I suppose I'll have to pay you.": 1, "I suppose I'd rather be here than most other places in Skyrim. If Isran needs me, it must be pretty bad.": 1, "I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting.": 1, "I suppose I should return to my papers...": 1, "I suppose I do. It's too bad it wore off so quickly though.": 1, "I suppose I could... what, praytell, is there?": 1, "I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.": 1, "I suppose I could dig up a staff or two for you.": 1, "I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.": 1, "I suppose Master Neloth won't mind. He's always telling me to get out of his way.": 1, "I suppose someone else will need to look after the Apprentices for now.": 1, "I suppose that depends. Are you willing to be an experimental subject?": 1, "I suppose that was Vahlok. He must have had this entire place built for him so that he could maintain his vigil, even beyond death.": 1, "I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.": 1, "I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?": 1, "I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?": 1, "I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here.": 1, "I suppose you're right. If she wants to spend her life at the bottom of an ale mug, it's her right.": 1, "I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.": 1, "I suppose you're right. At least here I'm safe from Mogrul.": 1, "I suppose you're lucky you're not dead. Or worse, one of them.": 1, "I suppose you'll have to find me a new steward.": 1, "I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else.": 1, "I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.": 1, "I suppose you think you should get paid for helping an old woman.": 1, "I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?": 1, "I suppose you have another question?": 1, "I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway.": 1, "I suppose you could have called me a bitter old hermit... now I'm just old.": 1, "I suppose you could call this the ultimate waiting game, each watching the other to see which will give in.": 1, "I suppose we're all a little crazy to be here, right?": 1, "I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions.": 1, "I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.": 1, "I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.": 1, "I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it.": 1, "I suppose that's true. Fine.": 1, "I suppose that's as much as I can hope for.": 1, "I suppose that's a benefit to having so few customers.": 1, "I suppose I can overlook it for now, but you better keep your hands clean or I'll come after you again... you got that?": 1, "I suppose... yes, I can see how that would have inverted the tether. Unfortunate. Couldn't you simply avoid water?": 1, "I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.": 1, "I suggest you put away your weapon. Wouldn't want to cause a... scene.": 1, "I stayed for a while and cared for him, then... I suppose we fell in love.": 1, "I stand with the Stormcloaks. You Imperial dogs will never break my will. Never!": 1, "I stand beside you, father, as always.": 1, "I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!": 1, "I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!": 1, "I spit on you, dead sister.": 1, "I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide.": 1, "I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed.": 1, "I spent my life tracking down that legend... until my damn apprentice stole everything from me, and published it all under his own name.": 1, "I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it.": 1, "I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living.": 1, "I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.": 1, "I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.": 1, "I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!": 1, "I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.": 1, "I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed.": 1, "I smell weakness...": 1, "I smell blood.": 1, "I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily.": 1, "I simply must have this! I'll pay you double what it's worth.": 1, "I simply locked the doors, hid beneath my counter and prayed to the Divines that my life would be spared and my shop wouldn't burn to the ground.": 1, "I showed up to watch, yeah.": 1, "I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits.": 1, "I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again.": 1, "I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!": 1, "I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...": 1, "I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.": 1, "I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...": 1, "I suggest you mind your own business and return to whatever it is you do here.": 1, "I suggest you listen to what Mercer has to say... if you want in.": 1, "I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.": 1, "I suggest you have Serana change you back. At once.": 1, "I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.": 1, "I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay.": 1, "I studied with them when I was young. They taught me how to Shout.": 1, "I studied with the Faculty of Chirurgeons in Cloudrest. I walked with the Hollow-Faced Men of Nohotogrha for three years.": 1, "I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband.": 1, "I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air. ": 1, "I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.": 1, "I still remember how to fight!": 1, "I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.": 1, "I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?": 1, "I still need some time to get used to the idea that there might be hope for us after all.": 1, "I still need some help, if you can spare the time.": 1, "I still have some research to do before I'll know anything for certain.": 1, "I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues.": 1, "I still have nightmares about what Ildari did to my friends.": 1, "I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.": 1, "I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.": 1, "I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.": 1, "I still cannot believe that Storn is gone.": 1, "I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.": 1, "I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it.": 1, "I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.": 1, "I supposed you want to be asked nicely. Very well.": 1, "I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.": 1, "I survived?": 1, "I think it's important, but... I couldn't really say.": 1, "I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward. Well done.": 1, "I think it may have to be far away from here.": 1, "I think it is, actually.": 1, "I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child.": 1, "I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!": 1, "I think he knew what would happen. He saw his death in that book.": 1, "I think he had regular contact with the Vigilants, and I know Isran kept track of them...": 1, "I think even Gunmar's been impressed with what we've managed to do with the Dwemer drawings. Let's see what we can do with these ones!": 1, "I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves.": 1, "I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.": 1, "I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier...": 1, "I think both of our parents have failed us. Just you and me against the world, now.": 1, "I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.": 1, "I think I've taught you everything I know. You might even be as good as me now.": 1, "I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.": 1, "I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.": 1, "I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing.": 1, "I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to.": 1, "I think I'm going to get another drink.": 1, "I think I'm going to be sick.": 1, "I think I'll like living here.": 1, "I think I'll hang on to my things, thank you.": 1, "I think I would, if it weren't for my son. And my wife.": 1, "I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.": 1, "I think it's time to leave...": 1, "I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations.": 1, "I think maybe I had a dream about someone with that name...": 1, "I think someone has a crush on Illdi.": 1, "...she said I'd forget, and usually I do, but sometimes... still remember their faces, their pleading...": 1, "I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are.": 1, "I think so. Just hold on a moment.": 1, "I think so. And thanks for asking.": 1, "I think so, but from where? I can't recall.": 1, "I think so, but I'm not sure where I heard the name.": 1, "I think so, but I can't remember how I know him. Or maybe I'm wrong. I'm not sure.": 1, "I think she would be happy to know that our collection has brought smiles to faces both young and old.": 1, "I think perhaps... I think you did more than that. You have my thanks.": 1, "I think perhaps you should speak to Isran. You don't look... well.": 1, "I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.": 1, "...she was real surprised when I pulled that knife from my boot...": 1, "I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.": 1, "I think our potential is on the rise. Hircine smiles on us. Let's not question too much.": 1, "...should have known she wouldn't wait for me... I'll gut that filthy farmer when I see him...": 1, "I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.": 1, "I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.": 1, "I think one of them came back. Nelacar. Stays at the Frozen Hearth, but I don't know why. He's not welcome in the College.": 1, "I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back.": 1, "I think not.": 1, "I think my voice is ready. I hope we've done this well. ": 1, "I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.": 1, "I think my father wanted to see you. Have you talked to him yet?": 1, "I think my father really died a long time ago. This was just... the end of something else.": 1, "I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.": 1, "I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.": 1, "I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.": 1, "I think I like the lake here just a little more.": 1, "I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!": 1, "I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay.": 1, "I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them.": 1, "I swear, is there no end to these uncouth savages, just throwing their trash wherever they please...": 1, "I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her...": 1, "I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!": 1, "I swear, if I'm being followed...": 1, "I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me.": 1, "I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really.": 1, "I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last.": 1, "...sweet Night Mother.": 1, "I swear, I'll kill you!": 1, "I swear, I left another bottle right here...": 1, "I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.": 1, "I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.": 1, "I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.": 1, "I swear I feel like I'm being watched.": 1, "I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I suspected there would be something down here. Do you know those spells already?": 1, "I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?": 1, "I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you. Not many survived Helgen.": 1, "I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.": 1, "I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim.": 1, "I suspect now it was Brother Adalvald's journals they were after. He was obsessed with ancient vampire artifacts and burial sites.": 1, "I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death.": 1, "I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me \"Why?\"": 1, "I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk.": 1, "I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.": 1, "I take care of the horses. And the goats. And the chickens. And the garden.": 1, "I think I know, but go ahead.": 1, "I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city.": 1, "I think I hear my daughter calling...": 1, "I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.": 1, "I think I have a few old spell books laying about. If you want more, you'll have to go to the College of Winterhold.": 1, "I think I expected more.": 1, "I think I almost got it.": 1, "...since she died. My aunt and uncle took over our farm and threw me out. Said I wasn't good for anything.": 1, "I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.": 1, "I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.": 1, "I think \"Seven Septims for Sigurd\" will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups.": 1, "I therefore honor-name you \"Qahnaarin,\" or Vanquisher in your tongue.": 1, "I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action.": 1, "I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.": 1, "I thank you, Morwen. It means very much to me to hear you say so.": 1, "I thank you for your protection, All-Maker.": 1, "I thank you for your kindness. ": 1, "I thank you for your help, my friend.": 1, "I thank you for your courtesy.": 1, "I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl.": 1, "I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.": 1, "I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back.": 1, "I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls.": 1, "I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.": 1, "I take my duties as Housecarl very seriously. I won't hesitate to shed blood if my uncle Vignar is threatened.": 1, "I take care of my friends.": 1, "I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people!": 1, "...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much...": 1, "I shouldn't be. Everyone wants to ask me about mama and uncle Roggvir.": 1, "I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me.": 1, "I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.": 1, "I remember my first feast. I envy you.": 1, "I remember her. Her stance. The way she walked. A trained warrior, no doubt.": 1, "I remember a temple on Solstheim, and working to build something. It... it was not a pleasant dream.": 1, "I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white.": 1, "I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Fort Dawnguard is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair.": 1, "I rejoice in my freedom, if only for a moment.": 1, "I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.": 1, "I recognize the name, but... I don't know how I know it. It sounds so familiar.": 1, "I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?": 1, "I remember she use to keep a small journal. See if you can dig it up.": 1, "I really need to get back to planning my wedding..": 1, "I really got myself into it this time.": 1, "I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable...": 1, "I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with.": 1, "I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.": 1, "I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices.": 1, "I really can't thank you enough for your help.": 1, "I really can't put this trip off for much longer.": 1, "I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.": 1, "I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.": 1, "I realize she cares about me, but she has to understand that I can't rest until I find out what happened to Gratian.": 1, "I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord.": 1, "I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.": 1, "I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.": 1, "I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you.": 1, "I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.": 1, "I said, next prisoner!": 1, "I said to put it on my account and that's the end of it. Understand?": 1, "I said shut up, scum!": 1, "I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.": 1, "I said no! No adventures, no theatrics, no thief-chasing!": 1, "I said my fine has been paid! Now let me out!": 1, "I said let's go. Now.": 1, "I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours.": 1, "I said get down there. Now.": 1, "I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment.": 1, "I said \"a free meat pie\". As in one. Here's yours.": 1, "I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake.": 1, "I run the mill, so I'm a busy woman. What is it?": 1, "I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.": 1, "I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.": 1, "I return you to the ash.": 1, "I return to you, Father.": 1, "I return from the war to find my home overrun with bandit filth.": 1, "I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us.": 1, "I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter.": 1, "...tra la la, tra la lee, da da dum dum, dee dee...": 1, "I requested refuge in the Soul Cairn, and in exchange, I would provide the Ideal Masters the souls that they craved.": 1, "I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!": 1, "I remember you... You were with us at Helgen... I heard you came around and picked the right side. Welcome to the Legion!": 1, "I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.": 1, "I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.": 1, "I said, on your knees, Elf!": 1, "I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!": 1, "I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!": 1, "I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.": 1, "I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.": 1, "I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell.": 1, "I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested.": 1, "I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite.": 1, "I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion.": 1, "I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work.": 1, "I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.": 1, "I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal.": 1, "I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work.": 1, "I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me.": 1, "I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?": 1, "I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.": 1, "I owed him a thousand septims, but not any more.": 1, "I owe you my life, friend.": 1, "I owe you a great deal, Nightingale.": 1, "I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks.": 1, "I owe you a debt for the timely rescue.": 1, "I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.": 1, "I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.": 1, "I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.": 1, "I oversee Markarth Smelter. Worker gets out of line, I get him back in line.": 1, "I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.": 1, "I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric...": 1, "I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull.": 1, "I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold.": 1, "I pledged myself to Molag Bal, and in his name I sacrificed a thousand innocents.": 1, "I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.": 1, "I promise you, it didn't always look like this.": 1, "I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me.": 1, "I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away...": 1, "I promise you, I have nothing but good intentions towards everyone in this town.": 1, "I promise to try and make this as painless as possible. Hold still.": 1, "I promise to make this as painless as possible. Hold still.": 1, "I promise to live up to your expectations.": 1, "I promise that any unrelated memories I run across will be kept in the strictest of confidences.": 1, "I promise a swift but painful end!": 1, "I promise I'll help you get out of here.": 1, "I probably have some potions around here that might interest you.": 1, "I presume you've already seen some of what I've accomplished. There is so, so much more to be done. I'm glad you're here.": 1, "I presume you're talking to me?": 1, "I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?": 1, "I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?": 1, "I presume you have something important to say?": 1, "I presume you are blind, given the state of your eyes.": 1, "I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together.": 1, "I prefer working in silver. More skill needed than forging iron or steel.": 1, "I prefer snow elf. The name \"Falmer\" usually holds a negative meaning to most travelers.": 1, "I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?": 1, "I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.": 1, "I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.": 1, "I pray you're right, Legate.": 1, "I pray to the All-Maker that whatever this was, it doesn't happen again.": 1, "I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be.": 1, "I saw a drawing of this once. This shard... it's... it's part of a key. A key made of pure Aetherium! The key to the Forge!": 1, "I saw it first! I'm taking it.": 1, "I saw more than enough political maneuvering in my time in House Dres. I was tired of it then, and I'm tired of it now.": 1, "I shall not fall!": 1, "I shall look around. We can proceed when you are ready.": 1, "I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.": 1, "I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband.

I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.": 1, "I set up the whole deal. A courier was supposed to be bringing it from Morrowind. He never arrived.": 1, "I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.": 1, "I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.": 1, "I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!": 1, "I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.": 1, "I serve the Dragonborn.": 1, "I serve no mortal!": 1, "I serve my master's will.": 1, "I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.": 1, "I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.": 1, "I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good.": 1, "I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages. ": 1, "I sense the power of the ancient blood in your veins. It has made you strong.": 1, "I sense his favor on you. For you... I will part with them, if you can pay my price.": 1, "I send you to your rest.": 1, "I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.": 1, "I served in the Great War against the Thalmor. I remember how bravely a Legionnaire can fight.": 1, "I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need.": 1, "I should bash your face in after all you've done.": 1, "I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.": 1, "I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff.": 1, "I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward.": 1, "I should think so! I'm well used to taking care of a house and the folk living in it.": 1, "I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!": 1, "I should say so.": 1, "I should remind Kleppr to clean this place up.": 1, "I should never have come to Markarth.": 1, "I should mix some of this into my next potion... who knows what would happen!": 1, "I should make sure Svari is okay.": 1, "I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.": 1, "I should kill you anyway, but that would be boring.": 1, "I should heat up the forge. Why does it have to be so hot?": 1, "I should have guessed.": 1, "I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.": 1, "I should have figured. Damn.": 1, "I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace.": 1, "I should have been more vigilant. I'm sorry.": 1, "I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer.": 1, "I should have another batch of vegetables ready for you soon, Geldis.": 1, "I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.": 1, "I should get back to work. Money doesn't count itself.": 1, "I should get back to memorizing recipes.": 1, "I should cut off your hands for that!": 1, "I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.": 1, "I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.": 1, "I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you.": 1, "I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.": 1, "I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?": 1, "I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.": 1, "I see you have little in the way of morals.": 1, "I see you chose a suitably high profile target. Well done.": 1, "I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.": 1, "I see you are eager to carry the light.": 1, "I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!": 1, "I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.": 1, "I see no harm in it, if you have the skill.": 1, "I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here.": 1, "I see everything, hear everything and know everything.": 1, "I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon! It is Auriel's Bow!": 1, "I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.": 1, "I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.": 1, "...told him to just hand it over, but did he listen? Oh, no... he had to fight back...": 1, "I second that, Igmund. Who knows what that family will do for power? They could be working with the Forsworn, for all we know.": 1, "I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers. Let me unlock it.": 1, "I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?": 1, "I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times.": 1, "I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship.": 1, "I say let them try. My men are ready for them.": 1, "I saw you. With the Forsworn. By the old gods, that was something.": 1, "I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!": 1, "I saw you steal that!": 1, "I saw two elves in the far distance, dragging something behind them. Hunters often visit our lands, so I thought little of it.": 1, "I saw this and thought of you. It would be a waste on anyone lesser. I hope you like it.": 1, "I saw the Fadrin brothers bobbing around in there this morning, so that makes three.": 1, "I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well.": 1, "I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir.": 1, "I see you have returned. Lord Harkon will be pleased.": 1, "I see you wish to be reasonable, perhaps I misjudged you.": 1, "...this is where I ended up. It was... quite the fall.": 1, "I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.": 1, "I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.": 1, "I see... similar to the exploding bolt, only this one will cause damage with splintering shards of ice sharp as glass. Charming!": 1, "I see... it looks like Suvaris has been traveling to Dawnstar to meet with a pirate crew there.": 1, "I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why.": 1, "...to you?": 1, "I see. You're simply here to stop the Tyranny of the Sun, despite the cost to Serana. Nothing else matters.": 1, "I see. You're a good soldier, Horik. I'm sorry for intruding.": 1, "I see. Where are you taking me, then? Is that much my business?": 1, "I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while.": 1, "I see. Well, perhaps you'll take pity on a humble priest who has lost something precious.": 1, "I see. Well, let's continue this discussion later then.": 1, "I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand.": 1, "I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you.": 1, "I see. Then there's nothing further to discuss. If you change your mind, speak with the Legate.": 1, "I see. That would explain much.": 1, "I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.": 1, "I see. It probably doesn't even matter now, what with the mess that's been made in here.": 1, "I see. Interesting that you can set aside your morals when it suits you.": 1, "I see. If something does happen, you know where I am.": 1, "I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?": 1, "I see you, heathen!": 1, "I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?": 1, "I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?": 1, "I see you still have the run of the place, traitor.": 1, "I'll paint the snow with your blood!": 1, "I'll pass it along.": 1, "...ain't goin' back to prison... rather die in the ash...": 1, "I, uh, I can't tell Thongvor. It's anyone's guess.": 1, "I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow - a \"Dragonstone,\" said to contain a map of dragon burial sites.": 1, "I've...failed...": 1, "I've... never heard of him. Is he well supported?": 1, "I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?": 1, "I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.": 1, "I've worked in the Treasury House for almost twenty years.": 1, "I've waited so long for this moment. We found it. At last.": 1, "I've waited an eternity for this day.": 1, "I've waited a long time for my chance to move up in the court.": 1, "I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.": 1, "I, uh... I'm going to be reading the spell book. Maybe it can tell me how to banish the Ash Guardian.": 1, "I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him.": 1, "I've tried to interest the villagers in reading and history, but I haven't had much luck.": 1, "I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.": 1, "I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.": 1, "I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse.": 1, "I've tried hitting against a stump by my tent but... iron needs iron, if you want it shaped right.": 1, "I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail.": 1, "I've tracked this damned bear for two weeks; I'll not let it have any more victims.": 1, "I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric...": 1, "I've told young Nikulas that the world beyond our lands is no place for the Skaal, but he won't listen. ": 1, "I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.": 1, "I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.": 1, "I've tried to tell him that the world beyond our lands is dangerous and cruel, but he won't listen.": 1, "I, uhh... wait, what?": 1, "I, well, no of course not. I would be glad to help.": 1, "I. Will. Destroy you!": 1, "I... I suppose this is difficult for you.": 1, "I... I submit. What is your bidding, master.": 1, "I... I see.": 1, "I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.": 1, "I... I must have been drugged. That's it. Someone drugged me. Maybe one of Mogrul's cronies.": 1, "I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.": 1, "I... I hadn't really thought of it. I'm still hoping we can go home.": 1, "I... I guess it would be all right if you want to adopt me. At least until my real parents get back.": 1, "I... I don't want to talk.": 1, "I... I don't understand. Where is it?": 1, "I... I don't remember. Ever since I got here... to Kolbjorn... I've heard whispers. Voices. Thoughts. Imaginings.": 1, "I... I don't know. What's wrong?": 1, "I... I don't know. It almost feels like a dream. Something about a temple on the island...": 1, "I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped.": 1, "I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going.": 1, "I... I don't know how I got here.": 1, "I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have.": 1, "I... I can't. I just can't be sure. I think maybe he had something to do with a temple. A temple here on the island. Does that help?": 1, "I... I can't really tell. ": 1, "I... I can't believe it. All those years on the farm, and my mother never told me about any of this.": 1, "I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.": 1, "I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you.": 1, "I... I apologize, master.": 1, "I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.": 1, "I... I almost can't believe it. We did it! We actually did it!": 1, "I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...": 1, "I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.": 1, "I've told you before, little cub, you're not old enough yet.": 1, "I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory.": 1, "I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield.": 1, "I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.": 1, "I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say.": 1, "I've seen better. Well, maybe not.": 1, "I've scrounged up a few things. Here, please, take a look.": 1, "I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.": 1, "I've said too much already.": 1, "I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!": 1, "I've really got to be going.": 1, "I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy.": 1, "I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting.": 1, "I've seen fresh recruits with more skill than you!": 1, "I've read stories. Stories about fools that managed to... communicate with them.": 1, "I've prepared the staff maker like you asked.": 1, "I've planted some new herbs in the courtyard garden. I hope they'll grow.": 1, "I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses.": 1, "I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off.": 1, "I've outlived worse than this!": 1, "I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here.": 1, "I've only heard stories. Not sure if any of them are true.": 1, "I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering...": 1, "I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way.": 1, "I've often asked myself that very same question. The blinding of my race was supposedly accomplished with a toxin.": 1, "I've no love for living out of a tent, but I'll take that over being ripped apart.": 1, "I've pried open another of Hermaeus Mora's secrets.": 1, "I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.": 1, "I've seen many visitors come and go, but you... there's something about you that I like.": 1, "I've seen outsiders in our village before, but none were like you.": 1, "I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again.": 1, "I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.": 1, "I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea.": 1, "I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard.": 1, "I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.": 1, "I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.": 1, "I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone.": 1, "I've sworn to keep Councilor Morvayn safe, and I intend to take that oath to the grave if need be.": 1, "I've still got some fight in me!": 1, "I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.": 1, "I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.": 1, "I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was.": 1, "I've spent years cleaning the place up and making repairs. You can be damn sure the vampires won't be burning this place down. ": 1, "I've spent quite a few years honing their skills and I can assure you they're not just your average city guard.": 1, "I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says.": 1, "I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports.": 1, "I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.": 1, "I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut.": 1, "I've sensed the blood pulsing a little stronger, of late. I had assumed you had as well. ": 1, "I've seen you walking with a bit of pain sometimes, Horik.": 1, "I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.": 1, "I've seen the way you look at her. Do you take me for a fool?": 1, "I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...": 1, "I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it \"Geirmund's Hall,\" but I don't know why.": 1, "I've seen plenty of drunks in my day, and I'll tell you right now that netch was sick.": 1, "I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone.": 1, "I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did.": 1, "I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.": 1, "I... I wish things were otherwise. All of these children deserve a better home. But there's nothing I can do.": 1, "If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself.": 1, "If I hadn't sunk every bit of gold I had into my mill, I would have picked up and left Ivarstead long ago.": 1, "If I hadn't lost all of the pages, I wouldn't be in this predicament and we wouldn't be having this conversation.": 1, "If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it. How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity for her...": 1, "If I had to guess, I'd say the moment mother fled the castle, father went on a rampage.": 1, "If I had the resources at my disposal, I'd build you a wall myself.": 1, "If I had my way, I'd spend all my time at parties like this, and none of it dealing with the common rabble.": 1, "If I had foreseen the value they placed on my own soul, I would never have come here.": 1, "If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry.": 1, "If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake.": 1, "If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already.": 1, "If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim.": 1, "If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed.": 1, "If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless.": 1, "If I don't, he'll find a new mycologist who will.": 1, "If I don't hear back from you after a while, you're probably dead. Maybe I'll send Talvas out next.": 1, "If I die today, it will not be in terror.": 1, "If I could only get my hands on Miraak. I'd make him pay for playing with my mind.": 1, "If I could just get my hands on Miraak for what he did to us...": 1, "If I could get a sample of ash from an ash spawn, that would be quite useful.": 1, "If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me.": 1, "If I cannot find a way to save them, there is no hope for our people.": 1, "If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can.": 1, "If I can remain useful, those above me will see fit to keep me here.": 1, "If I ever see her again, she will pay most dearly for that betrayal.": 1, "If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius.": 1, "If I may ask, what will you do with them now?": 1, "If I may, let me offer you a piece of advice.": 1, "If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?": 1, "If I'd known that I was married to a fox who digs under beds to look for treats, then perhaps I would have.": 1, "If I'd known it was so important to him, I'd have charged him more.": 1, "If I'd known Skyrim was so dangerous, I'd have brought more guards.": 1, "If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns.": 1, "If I were you, I'd look there.": 1, "If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here.": 1, "If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted.": 1, "If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor.": 1, "If I wasn't married to Ulfberth, I'd be out of business.": 1, "If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it.": 1, "If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.": 1, "If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir.": 1, "If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?": 1, "If I want to spend my last bag of coins getting drunk, that's my business. What does he care?": 1, "If I ventured far from the Soul Cairn, my strength would begin to wane until I was no more.": 1, "If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry.": 1, "If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me.": 1, "If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river.": 1, "If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry.": 1, "If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not.": 1, "If I return to Tamriel, that increases Harkon's likelihood of bringing the Tyranny of the Sun to fruition.": 1, "If I remember correctly, there's another cube somewhere to the south of the main Workshop.": 1, "If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind.": 1, "If I needed something from you, you would know it.": 1, "If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there.": 1, "I... I think I need to stop talking now...": 1, "If I can just... stand up...": 1, "If Harkon obtained Auriel's Bow and Serana's blood was used to taint the weapon, the Tyranny of the Sun would be complete.": 1, "I... don't know who that is. ": 1, "I... am... eternal...": 1, "I... am Lucien Lachance.": 1, "I... Yes, I understand.": 1, "I... Well, that's actually something I never would've anticipated. Interesting.": 1, "I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is...": 1, "I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.": 1, "I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.": 1, "I... I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but cannot place it.": 1, "I... I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought....": 1, "I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.": 1, "I... don't know who that is. Did he... mention my father at all?": 1, "I... I'm sorry.": 1, "I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that.": 1, "I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!  ": 1, "I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected...": 1, "I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?": 1, "I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet.": 1, "I... I'm so sorry, Torbjorn. You must be suffering terribly. I wish there was some way I could help.": 1, "I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is.": 1, "I... I'm not sure. I don't want to talk about this.": 1, "I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this.": 1, "I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and...": 1, "I... I'll get his things in order. ": 1, "I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.": 1, "I... fell. When the earthquake hit. The ground just... opened up.": 1, "I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.": 1, "I... it's like waking up out of a dream.": 1, "If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.": 1, "If General Carius is still alive, there must be something keeping him that way.": 1, "If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted.": 1, "If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it...": 1, "If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it.": 1, "If Bralsa wants to come back, she's welcome here... I swear.": 1, "If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat.": 1, "Idiot. You didn't really think I'd let you walk out of here either, did you? Vingalmo wants you both dead.": 1, "Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir.": 1, "Idiot.": 1, "Idiot! Those are hard to find. Next time don't fill it at all if you can't do it properly.": 1, "Idiot! I can't get to the scroll with Durnehviir attacking us!": 1, "I...I'm fading away!": 1, "I...I think I'm going to pretend that never happened.": 1, "I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.": 1, "I... you're right of course. It can be hard to hear the winds of Kynareth when all you hear are the rabble in the temple.": 1, "I... will... persevere...": 1, "I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.": 1, "I... well, let me think about it.": 1, "I... uh, I hadn't planned on it. Do you need my help?": 1, "I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.": 1, "I... see. And is this something I'll need to worry about in the future?": 1, "I... see.": 1, "I... oh, all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?": 1, "I... it's true, isn't it? You really are Dragonborn.": 1, "If I am to die today, so be it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "I've never trusted him... what has he done?": 1, "I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!": 1, "I've never seen leaves this color.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Falkreath.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Eastmarch.": 1, "I've called Raven Rock my home for a number of years. Azura knows why... it's a mess.": 1, "I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.": 1, "I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed.": 1, "I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.": 1, "I've been waiting for you, my sweet one.": 1, "I've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.": 1, "I've been waiting for this moment for a long time... even before I discovered Gratian's old things.": 1, "I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will. ": 1, "I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later. ": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Haafingar.": 1, "I've been trying to make my peace with it.": 1, "I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems.": 1, "I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.": 1, "I've been trying to adapt Redguard magic to the ash.": 1, "I've been trained by the Tong, fool!": 1, "I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him.": 1, "I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to.": 1, "I've been thinking... maybe Camilla needs a little help seeing Sven for what he is.": 1, "I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?": 1, "I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.": 1, "I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.": 1, "I've been thinking about this for a long time.": 1, "I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Hjaalmarch.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Whiterun.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Winterhold.": 1, "I've fought colds tougher than you!": 1, "I've finally located Vokun's crypt! The scroll I'm looking for just has to be here.": 1, "I've failed you... my lord...": 1, "I've even been attacked by dragons!": 1, "I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.": 1, "I've enchanted this ring to find the source of the attacks. Here, take it.": 1, "I've eaten more in the last two hours than I have in the last two weeks.": 1, "I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.": 1, "I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.": 1, "I've done some experiments in this area, but, well, my test subjects are far too fragile.": 1, "I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill.": 1, "I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.": 1, "I've discovered the whereabouts of one of the ancient Rings of Blood Magic.": 1, "I've discovered the whereabouts of a vampire lair.": 1, "I've discovered the whereabouts of a set of ancient Rings of Blood Magic.": 1, "I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.": 1, "I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique surely doesn't even approach yours... but whose would?": 1, "I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol.": 1, "I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.": 1, "I've come to know those ruins so well, I could draw you a map from memory. That's why I noticed the new passage the moment I laid eyes on it.": 1, "I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.": 1, "I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Rift.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Reach.": 1, "I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Pale.": 1, "I've been thinking about that, and I believe it does.": 1, "I've found a new candidate, ripe for Harkon's Gift. I'm sending you to welcome this soul into our family.": 1, "I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.": 1, "I've been the only girl here since forever. The boys pick on me, and they make me do all the chores.": 1, "I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.": 1, "I've been having difficulties with my heart stone experiments.": 1, "(Whistling)": 1, "I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.": 1, "I've been expecting you.": 1, "I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up.": 1, "I've been cleaning up spills and there is fresh linen for the rooms.": 1, "I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades.

This is a horror show!": 1, "I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave.": 1, "I've already told you everything I know, I swear.": 1, "I'm glad we could come to an agreement.": 1, "I'm glad to see you're well. I don't like sending people off to battle.": 1, "I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.": 1, "... what's that?": 1, "I'm glad to lend a hand.": 1, "I'm glad to know that, because I need your help. You see, I've lost something precious.  ": 1, "I'm glad to help any way I can.": 1, "I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.": 1, "I'm glad to assist you in any way I can.": 1, "I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!": 1, "I'm glad these platforms appear once you finish them. I don't want to find out what's down in that water.": 1, "I'm glad we found the scroll, but I... I wish she could come with us.": 1, "I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.": 1, "I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself.": 1, "I'm glad I could help.": 1, "I'm getting too old for this.": 1, "I'm getting there. Making my peace with it.": 1, "...\"he's got your eyes,\" she says... lyin' tramp...": 1, "I'm getting bored.": 1, "I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.": 1, "...As you say, sir.": 1, "I'm free! Thank you, outlander.": 1, "I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.": 1, "...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...": 1, "I'm glad that I'm finally traveling with someone who seems competent. My last patron was killed trying to tackle an entire fort of bandits alone.": 1, "I'm glad we're friends. I have something for you. Here.": 1, "I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.": 1, "I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.": 1, "... but I can get it. Sure, sure. Listen, I've heard this song before and I'm already tired of it. Come back when you're not a waste of my time.": 1, "I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot.": 1, "I'm going to hire some mercenaries this time, too. Having some people around who know how to fight should... ": 1, "I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam. If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book.": 1, "I'm going to have to go to Raven Rock soon. We're running low on some things.": 1, "... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it.": 1, "I'm going to go away for a while. I'll meet you back home when I'm done.": 1, "... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend.": 1, "I'm going to enjoy this!": 1, "I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!": 1, "I'm going to crush you like a bug!": 1, "I'm going to check the entrance to the Ratway. Be right back.": 1, "I'm going to check that out.": 1, "I'm going to be fine, my love. Captain Veleth would never allow anything to happen to us.": 1, "I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father.": 1, "I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?": 1, "I'm going to Dimhollow Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you.": 1, "I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.": 1, "I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I'm glad you're here. I need you to kill a Coldhearted Gravedigger, tends to work in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. This is all the gold I have.": 1, "I'm glad you're here. I don't think I could be doing this alone.": 1, "I'm glad you're here.": 1, "I'm glad you're here with me.": 1, "I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.": 1, "I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I'm flattered, but the village is my home. It's very rare for one of the Skaal to leave, and I have responsibilities here.": 1, "I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.": 1, "I'm fine, father. Work is fine.": 1, "...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy...": 1, "I'm busy right now, Colette.": 1, "I'm bored. What do you say we go smash a few heads in? This one's on me.": 1, "I'm bored, Benor. Nobody wants to have any fun with me.": 1, "I'm bored! Let's play a game!": 1, "I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you...": 1, "I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!": 1, "I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.": 1, "I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.": 1, "I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...": 1, "I'm being as careful as I can.": 1, "I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.": 1, "I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away.": 1, "I'm beginning to like this partnership. Here you go.": 1, "I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.": 1, "I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.": 1, "I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication.": 1, "I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls.": 1, "I'm asking myself why Miraak was making us build these shrines... and I'm afraid the answer will be far worse than any of us can imagine.": 1, "I'm as ready as I'm going to be.": 1, "I'm as ready as I can be.": 1, "I'm as much a Nord as the next man, but I'm no fool. I don't live in the past, like those Gray-Manes.": 1, "I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.": 1, "I'm an old woman. I can't possibly make that trip. It's way too dangerous.": 1, "I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.": 1, "I'm been farming this bit of land all my life.": 1, "I'm certain it's only stuck, Elder. I'll speak to Glover Mallory and see if he can take a look at it.": 1, "I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.": 1, "I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him.": 1, "I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's move on.": 1, "I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?": 1, "I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.": 1, "I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.": 1, "I'm feeling motivated. That's enough for now.": 1, "I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks.": 1, "I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.": 1, "I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.": 1, "I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend...": 1, "...Dawnguard getting to be more than a nuisance... gather some of the hunters... teach them a lesson...": 1, "I'm endin' you right now!": 1, "I'm eleven years old, and I could take you.": 1, "I'm dying for a rest. I swear, I could lie down right now, and just sleep forever.": 1, "I'm done for, little cub. Go. Run for it!": 1, "I'm doing my best to not think of him as my father anymore. ": 1, "I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?": 1, "I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?": 1, "I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.": 1, "I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.": 1, "...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...": 1, "I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.": 1, "I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices.": 1, "I'm counting on you.": 1, "I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius.": 1, "I'm commander of the guard, now.": 1, "I'm fine, Madena.": 1, "I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands.": 1, "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.": 1, "I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.": 1, "I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect.": 1, "I'm just one of the miners. I don't want any trouble.": 1, "I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace.": 1, "I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons...": 1, "I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.": 1, "I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself.": 1, "I'm just here to mine.": 1, "I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.": 1, "... Hmm...": 1, "... Hmm? ...": 1, "I'm just here to clean up.": 1, "I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work.": 1, "I'm just having trouble deciphering Master Neloth's handwriting.": 1, "I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?": 1, "I'm just as puzzled as you, lass.": 1, "I'm just as puzzled as you, lad.": 1, "I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.": 1, "I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?": 1, "I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.": 1, "I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me.": 1, "I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!": 1, "I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm.": 1, "I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.": 1, "I'm in your debt, Wulf. That bow you gave me is twice as strong as the last one I had.": 1, "I'm just glad we had this, now. I was almost getting ready to eat my servant and blame it on the Forsworn.": 1, "I'm just running some errands for the old man... Err... For myself. I'm just running some errands for myself...": 1, "I'm just sayin' you should pick one to settle down with.": 1, "I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.": 1, "I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history.": 1, "I'm no one special, just a miner who swings a pickaxe for his drinking money.": 1, "I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?": 1, "I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison.": 1, "I'm no fan of the sun, but it would be better than this.": 1, "I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.": 1, "I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.": 1, "I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.": 1, "I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.": 1, "*gasp*": 1, "I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.": 1, "I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?": 1, "I'm late! Gotta run!": 1, "I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that?": 1, "I'm kind of busy, but if you need any potions or ingredients, let me know.": 1, "I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's.": 1, "I'm keeping my eye on you.": 1, "I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can.": 1, "I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.": 1, "I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.": 1, "I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.": 1, "I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?": 1, "I'm just the cook, lass.": 1, "I'm just the cook, lad.": 1, "I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar.": 1, "I'm in the mood to ssssiiiiinnnggg! What about you, friend? Care to join me?": 1, "I'm going to put this back where it belongs. I'll never forget this. You've done a great thing for me and my sister.": 1, "I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could.": 1, "I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be.": 1, "I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble.": 1, "I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this.": 1, "I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men.": 1, "I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know.": 1, "I'm gonna wear that tail as a belt!": 1, "I'm gonna kill you!": 1, "I'm gonna have to kill you... again!": 1, "I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!": 1, "I'm gonna find you, Elf!": 1, "I'm gonna bleed you!": 1, "I'm going... as fast... as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see you... helping...": 1, "I'm guessing it's the one you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important to say to you.": 1, "I'm going with you whether you like it or not. ": 1, "I'm going to... put you down!": 1, "I'm going to track down that thief and murder him!": 1, "I'm going to tell father you said that. He'll tan your hide for sure!": 1, "I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.": 1, "I'm going to stay here and check on the mead.": 1, "I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect.": 1, "I'm going to send two of the best Redoran Guard we have to take them down. I want you to assist them any way you can.": 1, "I'm going to see if I can find some way out of here.": 1, "I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.": 1, "I'm going to rend you limb from limb!": 1, "I'm going to put you down.": 1, "I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing.": 1, "I'm guessing this one will be even faster. Just remember to stay focused, and most importantly, run!": 1, "I'm guessing you figured this part out already, but my father's not exactly a good person. Even by vampire standards.": 1, "I'm having fun, are you?": 1, "I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?": 1, "I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off?": 1, "I'm in charge of the prisoners here.": 1, "I'm in charge of Left Hand Mine. You cause trouble, you answer to me.": 1, "I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.": 1, "I'm in a bit of trouble here.": 1, "I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward. ": 1, "I'm impressed.": 1, "I'm impressed you could find a Moth Priest so quickly.": 1, "I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.": 1, "I'm hoping you didn't suffer much at the hands of those foul beings. Please, accept this as a token of my thanks.": 1, "I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.": 1, "I'm hoping to learn some of the Briarheart techniques, their methods.": 1, "I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.": 1, "I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.": 1, "I'm here! I knew I'd find you!": 1, "I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.": 1, "I'm here to help.": 1, "I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all.": 1, "I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that.": 1, "I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away.": 1, "I'm hearing that the Council will be staying in Blacklight permanently.": 1, "I'm hearing good things about you from Brynjolf.": 1, "... bah. It probably can't hurt to tell you. You look mostly honest.": 1, "I'm headed to the inn.": 1, "I'm in no mood to joke.": 1, "I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen.": 1, "I'm always happy to see a customer, but I won't deal in stolen goods. That's trouble I don't need.": 1, "I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?": 1, "I'll take care of you!": 1, "I'll take care of it.": 1, "I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.": 1, "I'll stick around this place if you need me.": 1, "I'll stay my weapon... for now.": 1, "I'll start translating it. Shouldn't take me more than a day or two.": 1, "I'll start round one. Down the hatch!": 1, "I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!": 1, "I'll stand guard here.": 1, "I'll stain the ground with your blood!": 1, "I'll stain the ash with your blood!": 1, "I'll take control of the family on my own time, Betrid. Until then, my brother remains in charge and you'll keep your mouth shut.": 1, "I'll spit you in two!": 1, "I'll spill your blood, fetcher!": 1, "I'll speak with Garyn and see if we can't increase the crop production this season.": 1, "I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.": 1, "I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.": 1, "I'll speak to Falion. I've heard he knows about these things.": 1, "I'll spare you - for now.": 1, "I'll skin you alive!": 1, "I'll show you what a real Orc can do!": 1, "I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.": 1, "I'll show you a real fight!": 1, "...Oh well. Thanks anyway, I suppose...": 1, "I'll spit on your corpse!": 1, "I'll take you as far as I can, but I'm not hanging around and it's gonna cost you extra.": 1, "I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you.": 1, "I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all.": 1, "I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.": 1, "...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim.": 1, "...Look, let's be realistic. You're an adventurer. It's not exactly a safe or reliable profession.": 1, "I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.": 1, "I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all.": 1, "I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?": 1, "I'll tell you what. The Guild's got a problem out here that I've been trying to deal with for years, but haven't been able to handle.": 1, "I'll tell you what. I appreciate what you're trying to do, so I'll play along.": 1, "I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer.": 1, "I'll tell you what we do. We spit in that curse's face and turn things around down here. Put things back the way they were.": 1, "I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.": 1, "I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere.": 1, "I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble.": 1, "I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.": 1, "I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...": 1, "I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.": 1, "I'll tear you to pieces!": 1, "I'll tear you apart!": 1, "I'll tear out your heart first!": 1, "I'll teach you to talk to me that way!": 1, "...Oh well. Thanks anyway, I guess.": 1, "I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?": 1, "I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment.": 1, "I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it.": 1, "I'll talk to Alvor about getting us a new one.": 1, "I'll shatter your bones like glass!": 1, "I'll tell you, the only thing more surprising than hearing from Isran after all these years was hearing that he wanted my help.": 1, "I'll set out at once, then.": 1, "I'll send your soul as a gift to Boethiah.": 1, "I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible.": 1, "I'll rip your heart out!": 1, "I'll rip you in half!": 1, "I'll rip the Dawnguard apart!": 1, "I'll return to my studies.": 1, "I'll return to Castle Volkihar as soon as I'm finished gathering my things.": 1, "I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!": 1, "I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!": 1, "I'll rend the flesh from your bones!": 1, "I'll remember this.": 1, "I'll remember that when the Stormcloaks liberate the city. No amount of money will protect you then, Battle-Born.": 1, "I'll scatter your ashes to the wind!": 1, "I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.": 1, "I'll raise a cup to your grave!": 1, "I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic.": 1, "I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return.": 1, "I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.": 1, "I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this.": 1, "I'll probably stay with the Dawnguard, for as long as they'll let me.": 1, "I'll probably stay here, for as long as they'll let me.": 1, "I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her.": 1, "I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques.": 1, "...You! Why?": 1, "I'll pay you back, if it means that much.": 1, "I'll read it. Thank you.": 1, "I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.": 1, "I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you.": 1, "I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm.": 1, "I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own. ": 1, "I'll send my men to secure any of the remaining goods you left behind. We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?": 1, "I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?": 1, "I'll see you.": 1, "I'll see you when I'm done. For now, I need to just do this.": 1, "...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing...": 1, "...Wait. You... you're one of us, aren't you? A werewolf?": 1, "I'll see you in pieces!": 1, "I'll see you hanged from the ramparts!": 1, "I'll see you hanged for this!": 1, "I'll see you dead and buried!": 1, "I'll see you burn!": 1, "I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.": 1, "...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero...": 1, "I'll see you at home.": 1, "...Yeah. I thought I was prepared for anything. How can you prepare for a damned earthquake?": 1, "I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend.": 1, "I'll see you at Fort Dawnguard.": 1, "I'll see you at Fort Dawnguard, then. Don't worry, Arkay will show me the way.": 1, "I'll see you again. Soon.": 1, "I'll see you again soon, I hope.": 1, "I'll see what I can do...": 1, "I'll see what I can do.": 1, "I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.": 1, "...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them.": 1, "I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.": 1, "I'll think about it.": 1, "I'll think on this, but I make no promises.": 1, "...I've almost got enough... just need one good haul...": 1, "I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.": 1, "I'm afraid not. If we don't do something soon, we may have to think about moving on.": 1, "I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.": 1, "I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?": 1, "I'm afraid not.": 1, "I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can.": 1, "I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.": 1, "I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.": 1, "I'm afraid it isn't that simple. If it was, I would have the book already.": 1, "I'm afraid in their current form, they still believe the Chantry to be an active center of worship.": 1, "I'm afraid in my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the time I needed to prepare. The failure is purely mine to bear.": 1, "...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf...": 1, "I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment.": 1, "I'm afraid he's a few years too late. I've moved on. I have more important business to attend to.": 1, "...I should go back to pickin' pockets in Windhelm... easy money, less chance of an axe in your skull...": 1, "I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically.": 1, "I'm afraid I've lost them.": 1, "I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines.": 1, "I'm afraid I'll need elven arrows if you want me to produce the Sunhallowed Arrows, and it seems you're all out of them at the moment.": 1, "I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe... oh, and he wants you dead.": 1, "I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with the scrolls any longer, milord.": 1, "I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with the scrolls any longer, milady.": 1, "I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.": 1, "I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.": 1, "I'm afraid he's asked to not be disturbed. He has important business.": 1, "I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll.": 1, "I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.": 1, "I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.": 1, "I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.": 1, "I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week.": 1, "I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate.": 1, "I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil.": 1, "I'm all ears.": 1, "I'm all alone. I... I try to sell flowers so I can buy food. It's not much but... what else can I do?": 1, "I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.": 1, "I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.": 1, "I'm afraid you've been a little mis-informed. I have something of mine, that I was going to sell to Arniel.": 1, "I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading.": 1, "I'm afraid you do.": 1, "I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries.": 1, "I'm afraid we're completely out of them at the moment.": 1, "I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.": 1, "I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.": 1, "I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.": 1, "I'm afraid there's not much more to tell. Even today, the Elder Scrolls remain a great enigma.": 1, "I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.": 1, "I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.": 1, "I'm afraid the necklaces aren't selling well. Customers are not interested in medallions engraved with the symbols of other provinces.": 1, "I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.": 1, "I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place is at least livable now. Good luck with, your, um... murders.": 1, "I'm afraid that's impossible.": 1, "I'm afraid that one day I'll awaken and discover him dead, and I don't want it to come to that.": 1, "I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.": 1, "I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though.": 1, "I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.": 1, "I'm afraid I didn't see anything...": 1, "I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful...": 1, "I'm Hroar. You know, like the sound the lion makes? That's what my mother used to say.": 1, "I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.": 1, "I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons.": 1, "I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.": 1, "I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.": 1, "I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.": 1, "I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.": 1, "I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?": 1, "I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.": 1, "I'll... gut you!": 1, "I'll... get you!": 1, "I'll... Kill you!": 1, "I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!": 1, "I'll... I can... just...": 1, "I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment.": 1, "I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.": 1, "I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.": 1, "I'll wait for you here.": 1, "I'll wait for you at the dock.": 1, "I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.": 1, "...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry!": 1, "I'll try to forget you ever asked.": 1, "I'll try and make this quick!": 1, "I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!": 1, "I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?": 1, "I'm Igmund's uncle as well as his steward. ": 1, "I'm not \"afraid\" of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong.": 1, "I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?": 1, "I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.": 1, "I'm afraid I can't give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of Miraak's toward the center of the island.": 1, "...I suppose you're right. What can it hurt?": 1, "I'm afraid \"acceptable\" just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent.": 1, "I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.": 1, "I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.": 1, "I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be \"nice.\"": 1, "I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith.": 1, "I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds.": 1, "I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.": 1, "I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?": 1, "...I'd kill for a decent bottle of mead... not fair that they always take the good stuff...": 1, "I'm a loyal servant of the lord of the castle, nothing more.": 1, "I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.": 1, "I'm a little nervous about all of this.": 1, "I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.": 1, "I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.": 1, "I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners.": 1, "I'm a cripple. I have a reason to be drinking.": 1, "I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line.": 1, "I'm a bit busy at the moment, what did you want?": 1, "I'm a bard by trade. Perhaps you've heard of me?": 1, "I'm a Thane. In the future, you may want to gain that information before talking with someone. Risk of looking like an idiot, and all that.": 1, "I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured.": 1, "I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter.": 1, "...I'll find you...": 1, "I'm Skald's housecarl and head of his guard in Dawnstar.": 1, "I'm not \"fretting.\" I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!": 1, "I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back.": 1, "I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy.": 1, "I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.": 1, "I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.": 1, "I'm still looking for someone to deliver my message to Sibbi Black-Briar...": 1, "I'm still hard at work on the second volume of my epic.": 1, "I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.": 1, "I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you.": 1, "I'm starting to think...": 1, "I'm starting to think you like this as much as I do!": 1, "I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.": 1, "I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas. ": 1, "I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.": 1, "I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place. ": 1, "I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't....": 1, "I'm sorry. We're only interested in helping our patrons.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to the Summerset Isle.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.": 1, "I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.": 1, "I'm sorry. The mead... it is good.": 1, "I'm sorry. What would you like to talk about?": 1, "I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments.": 1, "I'm still waiting for that ash sample from an ash spawn.": 1, "I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them.": 1, "I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.": 1, "I'm sure she would want you to be happy, father. Entertaining the guests and drinking and making your lewd jokes like before.": 1, "I'm sure she will prove most useful.": 1, "I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.": 1, "I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out.": 1, "I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger.": 1, "I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again.": 1, "I'm sure it will be fine. Just don't be late.": 1, "I'm sure he's learned his lesson. Let's try to enjoy ourselves.": 1, "I'm sure he's down there somewhere, buried under a mountain of rubble like the East Empire Company claims.": 1, "I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?": 1, "I'm sure he will prove most useful.": 1, "I'm sure everything will be fine.": 1, "I'm sure Talvas won't mind being my test subject again.": 1, "I'm sure Riverwood will be all right, dear. When the Jarl learns what's happened, he's sure to send soldiers.": 1, "I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier.": 1, "I'm sure Lord Harkon will be most pleased with your efforts. Find him at once.": 1, "I'm sure Lord Harkon is grateful you've returned his daughter.": 1, "I'm sure I'll manage to repay him later, but you... What can I do to thank you?": 1, "I'm sure I know what this is about.": 1, "I'm sure I heard something...": 1, "I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.": 1, "I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?": 1, "I'm stuck fighting a giant now, thanks to you. So you're going to help me.": 1, "I'm strong, and quick, and can do any chore you want. Come on, adopt me. Please?": 1, "I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever.": 1, "I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.": 1, "I'm sorry. My mind was just somewhere else. Did you need a room? Drink?": 1, "I'm sorry. I wish I knew a better way, something that would be easier for you. ": 1, "I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know... I didn't see.": 1, "I'm sorry, Legate. I didn't want to imply anything about your ability to lead. You're a hero to the Empire, and I....": 1, "I'm sorry, I've come too far to lose it now.": 1, "I'm sorry, I've already said too much. Talk to Second Councilor Arano if you're willing to help us.": 1, "I'm sorry, I'm still a bit dizzy from everything.": 1, "I'm sorry, I'm not about to do that without at least a single gyro to show for my efforts.": 1, "I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain.": 1, "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.": 1, "I'm sorry, I had heard there were vampire hunters here. I thought they might want to know about a vampire plot to enslave the rest of the world.": 1, "I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later.": 1, "I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.": 1, "I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.": 1, "I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable giving them to you.": 1, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize.": 1, "I'm sorry, I can't help you.": 1, "I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh....": 1, "I'm sorry, Elder. I'm doing the best I can.": 1, "I'm sorry, Betrid. I'll clean them right away.": 1, "I'm sorry, Betrid. I thought I had cleaned the tables properly.": 1, "I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account.": 1, "I'm sorry, Aduri, not this year. Perhaps next year after the harvest, I don't know. There's so much to do.": 1, "I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!": 1, "I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting.": 1, "I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman.": 1, "I'm sorry, I don't carry coin. Perhaps next time.": 1, "I'm sorry, but I really can't.": 1, "I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along.": 1, "I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold.": 1, "I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.": 1, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't bark at you like that.": 1, "I'm sorry. I just don't feel up to entertaining anyone just now.": 1, "I'm sorry. I don't think I can bare to sell anything right now.": 1, "I'm sorry. I don't know anymore. I'm just visiting here from Cyrodiil.": 1, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.": 1, "I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland.": 1, "I'm sorry, what?": 1, "I'm sorry, were you about to say something?": 1, "I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion.": 1, "I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems.": 1, "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect.": 1, "I'm sorry, no. Grelod is the headmistress here, and she's decided not to allow any adoptions right now.": 1, "I'm sorry, my love. It's this island... it's never felt the same since we left Vvardenfell. It's as though a part of me is missing.": 1, "I'm sorry, my friend. I can no longer be of use in this matter.": 1, "I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring.": 1, "I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care.": 1, "I'm sorry, it's not that... it's just that I don't know who I can trust just yet.": 1, "I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?": 1, "I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now.": 1, "I'm sorry, but you're not leaving alive.": 1, "I'm sorry, but you must leave now.": 1, "(muffled grunts)": 1, "I'm sorry, but until you own a home with a room for your children, I can't allow you to adopt anyone.": 1, "I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go.": 1, "I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you.": 1, "I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.": 1, "I'm sure that the owner of that place is relieved. They certainly came through with the coin.": 1, "I'm sure that, in time, this little sapling will grow into a new Gildergreen that will tower over Whiterun. Thank you. ": 1, "I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?": 1, "I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.": 1, "I'm warning you, when I get my heart set on something I'm not easily put off.": 1, "I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult.": 1, "I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim.": 1, "I'm waiting to hear what any of this means.": 1, "I'm very interested to find out what happens when they finish.": 1, "I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.": 1, "I'm very dangerous! Don't make me come out there and hurt you!": 1, "I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him.": 1, "I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them.": 1, "I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.": 1, "I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?": 1, "I'm trying to pay attention.": 1, "I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.": 1, "I'm trying to apologize. Do you want to listen?": 1, "I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working.": 1, "I'm truly grateful. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.": 1, "I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave.": 1, "I'm too upset to talk....": 1, "I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink.": 1, "I'm too old for this.": 1, "I'm too busy to deal with this right now. Go take them to her.": 1, "I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion.": 1, "I'm trying to put it to good use.": 1, "I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.": 1, "I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?": 1, "I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side.": 1, "I've already told him. I don't have it!": 1, "I've already said too much.": 1, "I've already put in a claim to the land and property you'll forfeit when you're found to be a collaborator.": 1, "I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.": 1, "I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again.": 1, "I've already learned more than I would have in twice the time at the College of Winterhold.": 1, "I've already agreed to pay him quite handsomely for the... well, the item in question.": 1, "I've allowed my hatred of your father to estrange us for too long. Forgive me.": 1, "I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me...": 1, "I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!": 1, "I'm...I'm invisible!": 1, "I'm... not sure. I've never heard of the Divines speaking directly to someone before.": 1, "I'm... Well, who I am isn't important. Let's leave it at that, hmm?": 1, "I'm... I'm so cold...": 1, "I'm... I'm not sure what happened.": 1, "I'm... I'm not really sure. I think it's important, but I can't say why...": 1, "I'm, uh... my name is Agmaer, sir.": 1, "I'm worried. I think she knows.": 1, "I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.": 1, "I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do.": 1, "I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.": 1, "I'm working on it, now give me some silence so I can think.": 1, "I'm wondering what my mother got up to, here. She definitely wasn't trying to keep the place clean.": 1, "I'm with you, Listener.": 1, "I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.": 1, "I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.": 1, "I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.": 1, "I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks.": 1, "I'm through with you. Get out of my way.": 1, "I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense.": 1, "I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.": 1, "I'm surprised you think you can manage without me, but it's your choice.": 1, "I'm surprised you succeeded. Please accept this as payment.": 1, "I'm surprised you had the wits to notice, Olfrid, what with your nose buried so far up the Emperor's backside.": 1, "I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.": 1, "I'm sure. I'm sure.": 1, "I'm sure your reward will be great for ensuring our Lord's success.": 1, "I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.": 1, "I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage.": 1, "I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before.": 1, "I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.": 1, "I'm sure you're right.": 1, "I'm sure you two will get along famously.": 1, "I'm sure you have more important things to do. Farewell, then.": 1, "I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.": 1, "I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved.": 1, "I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read.": 1, "I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage.": 1, "I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.": 1, "I'm sure we can strike a bargain.": 1, "I'm sure there's plenty of people in Raven Rock to choose from.": 1, "I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me.": 1, "I'm sure the Khajiit would have one- their toys are the best!": 1, "I'm sure the All-Maker has more important concerns than your potatoes, Oslaf.": 1, "I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.": 1, "I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor.": 1, "I'm taking it anyway.": 1, "I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.": 1, "I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it.": 1, "I'm thinking of going for a walk up the mountain later. Would you like to come?": 1, "I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your...": 1, "I'm the wife of a Second Councilor and certain things are expected of me.": 1, "I'm the only person alive that can cultivate nirnroot from a seed to a fully grown plant.": 1, "I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow.": 1, "I'm the leader of the Skaal, but it's the All-Maker who truly protects and provides.": 1, "I'm the last one. The others are all dead now.": 1, "I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.": 1, "I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.": 1, "I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.": 1, "I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course.": 1, "I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.": 1, "I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?": 1, "I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.": 1, "I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.": 1, "I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business.": 1, "I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.": 1, "I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price.": 1, "I'm telling you... there's something big down there, something that the East Empire Company wanted to hide from everyone.": 1, "I'm telling you, there's something strange with the moondial.": 1, "I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground.": 1, "I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.": 1, "I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun.": 1, "I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!": 1, "I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?": 1, "I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense.": 1, "I'm sorry to turn you away. I hope you understand.": 1, "I'm sorry to say I know very little about that... bee farm, was it?": 1, "I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...": 1, "I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane.": 1, "I'm not sure it's really your place to judge me.": 1, "I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.": 1, "I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck.": 1, "I'm not sure about this circle, but it's obviously... something.": 1, "I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead.": 1, "I'm not so sure we should be here.": 1, "I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.": 1, "I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.": 1, "I'm not setting foot out that door unless it's absolutely necessary. If I do that, I'll be even colder than I am now!": 1, "I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it.": 1, "I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message.": 1, "I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago.": 1, "I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?": 1, "I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.": 1, "I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things.": 1, "I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.": 1, "I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...": 1, "*Sigh* I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it.": 1, "*Sigh*... and that's the last one. All right, enough of this.": 1, "I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either.": 1, "I'm not playing with you, Kayd! You play mean!": 1, "I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.": 1, "I'm not seeing things again, am I?": 1, "I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else.": 1, "I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.": 1, "I'm not sure what they did to this Moth Priest, but he doesn't look right.": 1, "I'm not the only one seeing this, am I?": 1, "I'm not the most powerful of vampires, but I'm good with a hammer. See for yourself.": 1, "I'm not talking about this with you any more.": 1, "I'm not talking about that. I have a knack for smelling trouble, and for some reason you reek of it.": 1, "I'm not taking this trip for pleasure, you know. Let's get to Nchardak.": 1, "I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.": 1, "I'm not sure. Perhaps I'm just remembering something wrong.": 1, "I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.": 1, "I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?": 1, "I'm not sure. I think so, but the only thing that comes to mind is a shrine near the Earth Stone.": 1, "I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together.": 1, "I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.": 1, "I'm not sure. Did we build it? I can't remember...": 1, "I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper...": 1, "I'm not sure.": 1, "I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it?": 1, "I'm not sure you belong here, friend.": 1, "I'm not sure why House Redoran is so insistent on maintaining Solstheim. Seems like more trouble than it's worth.": 1, "I'm not sure whether that makes you brave or foolish. What brings you here?": 1, "I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest.": 1, "I'm not sure where else I'd go.": 1, "I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here.": 1, "I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.": 1, "I'm not sure what this is all about.": 1, "I'm not sure what they would do with one, but in this case Isran is probably correct in thinking it isn't good.": 1, "I'm not opening this door, so you might as well leave me alone.": 1, "I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.": 1, "I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around.": 1, "I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same.": 1, "I'm not exactly... comfortable around guards or jails. Definitely not when associates of mine have been locked up. No, I'll meet you outside of town.": 1, "I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it.": 1, "I'm not even sure... I can picture a temple, here on Solstheim. Must've been a bad dream.": 1, "I'm not chasing that map. It's a fool's errand. I'm done.  Leave me alone.": 1, "I'm not certain what use it would be.": 1, "I'm not certain what business it is of yours, but I'm moth... I mean Jarl Maven's steward.": 1, "I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.": 1, "*coughs* The cat... *gasp* Ra'jiir... ambushed me. He's trying to take the sword back! I... can't... *gasp*": 1, "I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow.": 1, "I'm not backing down!": 1, "I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes.": 1, "I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor.": 1, "I'm not asking you if I can stay, I'm telling you. Now that's the end of it.": 1, "I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private.": 1, "I'm not allowed to stand on furniture.": 1, "I'm not afraid of you. She's not coming in here, and that's that.": 1, "I'm not afraid of you.": 1, "I'm not afraid of you!": 1, "I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home.": 1, "I'm not afraid of anyone. Put a sword in my hand and I could defend this place if I had to!": 1, "I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.": 1, "I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.": 1, "I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.": 1, "I'm not a scholar, Esbern. How many times do I have to tell you?": 1, "I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid.": 1, "I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.": 1, "I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.": 1, "I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.": 1, "I'm not looking for special treatment, Aval. All I did was talk to Ulfric.": 1, "I'm not looking for conversation.": 1, "I'm not leaving this kitchen until that thing is gone!": 1, "I'm not known for my patience.": 1, "I'm not kidding. I'll hurt you!": 1, "I'm not kicking down anyone's door until I have solid evidence in hand.": 1, "I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.": 1, "I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask.": 1, "I'm not interested in fighting anymore.": 1, "I'm not impressed.": 1, "I'm not holding back. If I knew something I wouldn't wait until you strolled in, I'd come find you.": 1, "I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.": 1, "I'm not harassing her. She just needs to decide what kind of person she wants to be.": 1, "I'm not happy about this. He... he was still my father. But I suppose my father really died a long time ago.": 1, "I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying.": 1, "I'm not going to waste my time making sure your friend doesn't get killed. When it's just you and me, we can go.": 1, "I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I? I know, I know. I was just like you, once.": 1, "I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We're in a bad way down here.": 1, "I'm not going to lead them to their deaths if they aren't ready.": 1, "I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining the Legion.": 1, "I'm not going to do that for you.": 1, "I'm not going to die like this!": 1, "I'm not going to blamed for whatever happens.": 1, "I'm not going to be the one to destroy a marriage. I'm sorry.": 1, "I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.": 1, "I'm not one for commendations, but I might've lost everything that matters. So... thanks.": 1, "I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.": 1, "I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon! We need to fall back!": 1, "I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.": 1, "I'm so confused. What's happening?": 1, "I'm so close to the answer...": 1, "I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it!": 1, "I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer.": 1, "I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer, and you hurl baseless accusations at me?": 1, "I'm sick of all this ash. I know dunmer aren't supposed to mind the ash, but I hate it.": 1, "I'm shopping. Excuse me.": 1, "I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.": 1, "I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.": 1, "I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker.": 1, "I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass.": 1, "I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.": 1, "I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway.": 1, "I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore.": 1, "I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here.": 1, "I'm saying you've got the coin but you didn't earn a septim of it honestly. I can tell.": 1, "I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.": 1, "I'm running low on heart stones.": 1, "I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.": 1, "I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.": 1, "I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.": 1, "I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.": 1, "I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.": 1, "I'm running food and supplies to the miners.": 1, "I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?": 1, "I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.": 1, "I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.": 1, "I'm so glad you could attend today.": 1, "I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?": 1, "(screams)": 1, "I'm sorry to drag you into Markarth's problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time.": 1, "I'm sorry to bother you, but Second Councilor Arano asked me to come find you. He said it's quite urgent.": 1, "I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.": 1, "I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left.": 1, "I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.": 1, "I'm sorry my Brother.": 1, "I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him.": 1, "I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!": 1, "I'm sorry if I was hard on you before.": 1, "I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks.": 1, "I'm sorry about my housekeeper. She's a little protective of me.": 1, "I'm sorry about before. You're not wrong, it's just...": 1, "I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him.": 1, "I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild.": 1, "I'm sorry I lost myself for a moment there. I just need some time to get over the loss.": 1, "I'm sorry I don't have more to offer.": 1, "I'm so tired...": 1, "I'm so sorry. I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future.": 1, "I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon.": 1, "I'm so sorry Miss Temba. Perhaps if you would have been more specific...": 1, "I'm so nervous.": 1, "I'm so hungry...": 1, "I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.": 1, "(sigh)": 1, "I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly.": 1, "I'm relieved that you were able to save Baldor. I admit, I wasn't ready to become smith of the Skaal.": 1, "I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave.": 1, "I'm pleased you've reconsidered.": 1, "I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around.": 1, "I'm pleased I was mistaken about you, serjo.": 1, "I'm perfectly content with my current position.": 1, "I'm part of a group that's been looking for you... well, someone like you, for a very long time.": 1, "I'm over here!": 1, "I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family.": 1, "I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal.": 1, "(yawn) I'm so tired...": 1, "I'm one of the few native sons of the Reach that owns land. It doesn't make me very popular.": 1, "I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.": 1, "I'm one of General Tullius's agents. I was sent to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family.": 1, "I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.": 1, "I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.": 1, "I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.": 1, "I'm on my way to Skaal Village. Perhaps I'll see you there.": 1, "I'm on my way to Markarth to confer with my colleague, Calcelmo. I've no time to stop and chat.": 1, "I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?": 1, "*Gasp* Finally, someone came!... I...": 1, "I'm on fire!": 1, "I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me.": 1, "I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it.": 1, "I'm okay with the dark, but I've spent more than my share of time in caves already.": 1, "I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.": 1, "I'm off to take up my new position with Master Neloth.": 1, "I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time.": 1, "I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.": 1, "I'm prepared to negotiate my surrender!": 1, "I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee.": 1, "I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. ": 1, "I'm ready. More than ready.": 1, "I'm ready. Let's go!": 1, "I'm ready. I made my peace with the gods long ago.": 1, "I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.": 1, "I'm ready when you are.": 1, "I'm ready to go!": 1, "I'm ready to go when you are.": 1, "I'm ready if you are.": 1, "I'm ready for this party to be over.": 1, "I'm quite sure the boilers will not work while they're under water.": 1, "I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done.": 1, "I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.": 1, "I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?": 1, "I'm quite aware of what's going on here, and I will not stand for it!": 1, "I'm quite alright, thanks to you. Dexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth Priest of the White Gold Tower.": 1, "I'm putting a lot of faith in you. Don't let me down.": 1, "I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.": 1, "I'm proud to call a man like you friend.": 1, "I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side.": 1, "I'm proud of you, Hilund. You've held up well.": 1, "I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.": 1, "I'm proud of what we've managed to accomplish.": 1, "I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.": 1, "I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?": 1, "I joined with Bashnag then, but I thought of Savela every day. So I snuck off, hoping to find and steal away with her.": 1, "Absolutely. Here's your payment.": 1, "I do not think he has the patience to work the forge.": 1, "A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?": 1, "A boy's gotta make a livin', right?": 1, "A bunch of feral vampires are running wild, upsetting the mortals.": 1, "I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something.": 1, "A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.": 1, "A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.": 1, "I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something.": 1, "I hear your crops sold well at the market. Well done, Ennis.": 1, "I don't know you.": 1, "I grant you a new life!": 1, "I don't know you. You in Riften lookin' for trouble?": 1, "I hear you've been busy of late.": 1, "I don't know!": 1, "I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.": 1, "I don't know! I hope I didn't. But... maybe I... please, you have to believe me?": 1, "I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life.": 1, "I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.": 1, "I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely.": 1, "I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.": 1, "I got this for you. It's nothing big, but I hope you like it. I want you to know I appreciate your friendship.": 1, "I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!": 1, "I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss.": 1, "I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?": 1, "I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.": 1, "I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.": 1, "I got something for you. But you'll have to come and get it.": 1, "I cannot be beaten!": 1, "I don't know you, and the last thing I want is a stranger with her nose in my business. Go away.": 1, "I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested.": 1, "I cannot help with that. None here can. You will need the knowledge Miraak himself learned. You will need to learn more about this Black Book.": 1, "I grow restless. As does my blade.": 1, "I grow ever stronger, Dragonborn.": 1, "A bit of jewelry for your journey home?": 1, "I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti.": 1, "I cannot deny it. You remind me of all the things I miss about Skyrim, and my heart beats a little quicker when you are near. Do you feel the same?": 1, "I grow ever nearer to you.": 1, "I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.": 1, "I cannot be defeated!": 1, "I grieve that you must meet your end this way, but necessity demands it.": 1, "I don't know you, and the last thing I want is a stranger with his nose in my business. Go away.": 1, "I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?": 1, "I hear you put Laelette out of her misery. ": 1, "I grew up in the city of Blacklight in Morrowind. If you ever get the chance, you should visit there... it's spectacular.": 1, "I hear you're doing a lot of the work in tracking down these vampires. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.": 1, "I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles.": 1, "I don't know yet. The Moth Priest died before finishing the transcription, but he did name the Elder Scrolls that contained the prophecy.": 1, "I hear you're the reason Councilor Morvayn's still breathing today. Serves those damn Hlaalu traitors right!": 1, "A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere.": 1, "A book? I'd hardly call a twenty-six volume epic simply a \"book.\"": 1, "I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk.": 1, "I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders.": 1, "I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent.": 1, "I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.": 1, "I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.": 1, "I heard a lot of vague nonsense. You could interpret that a hundred different ways.": 1, "I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here.": 1, "I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!": 1, "I heard it was messy.": 1, "I don't know, my darling wife. I assume you're going to tell me?": 1, "I can't think of anyone better suited to return the Key. Just remember to keep your eyes open and walk true with the shadows.": 1, "I got a warmer welcome from my father, and that's saying something.": 1, "I don't know, not for sure.": 1, "I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.": 1, "I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.": 1, "I can't think of any reason I'd want to lose this gift. Especially after what I did to get it.": 1, "I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.": 1, "I heard something.": 1, "I don't know, maybe. Won't know until we get him out of there.": 1, "I give, and I give.": 1, "I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.": 1, "I can't think of a more deserving champion to carry it than you.": 1, "I heard that you and Tharstan explored an ancient crypt. That sounds like an exciting adventure.": 1, "I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?": 1, "I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.": 1, "I don't know. Are you not listening at all?": 1, "I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock.": 1, "I don't know. But I mean to find out.": 1, "I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?": 1, "I don't know. Certainly not longevity. Kind of a waste of time for a vampire.": 1, "I don't know. Coming from a place like this, well... it's not really me. I hope you can believe that.": 1, "I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.": 1, "I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.": 1, "I don't know, look for someone else to hop into bed with perhaps!": 1, "I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful.": 1, "I can't wait to see what's inside!": 1, "I don't know, Babette. Looks like he may have suffered a head wound. Best not let him out of our sight...": 1, "I can't wait to see the courtyard again.": 1, "I don't know, Babette. Looks like she may have suffered a head wound. Best not let her out of our sight...": 1, "I don't know, I don't know!": 1, "I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'.": 1, "I got nothing on me. If you're looking for Skooma, head on downstairs.": 1, "I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.": 1, "A Moth Priest?": 1, "I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.": 1, "I got no quarrel with you, but I won't turn one down, neither.": 1, "I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.": 1, "I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.": 1, "I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like.": 1, "I can't wait to get back to the village and start writing about this place.": 1, "I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them.": 1, "I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see.": 1, "I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.": 1, "I heard about you being pardoned. What were the guards thinking, taking you in?": 1, "I got enough troubles on my mind just tryin' to scrape by out here.": 1, "I heard crazy old Crescius has been sneaking into Raven Rock Mine again. At his age, he's going to get himself killed in there.": 1, "I heard from Deor how you went in search of Baldor. That was very brave, and in fact, that's just the kind of courage I'm looking for.": 1, "I don't know, it's hard to remember...": 1, "I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music.": 1, "I can't think of anyone better.": 1, "I grow tired of counting coin all day. Put steel in my hand, not gold.": 1, "I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.": 1, "I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?": 1, "I cannot leave this unfinished. I must remain.": 1, "I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.": 1, "I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that.": 1, "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here to do a job, and that's it.": 1, "I come from three generations of miners, and I'm telling you that the East Empire Company was wrong.": 1, "I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.": 1, "I don't know what your aunts told you, but...": 1, "I don't know what your playing at, Glover... but something about you just doesn't add up.": 1, "I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.": 1, "I guess that comes down to footwork, then.": 1, "I guess someone else will be taking his room, now.": 1, "I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble.": 1, "I command powers you can only dream of!": 1, "I claim your soul for Nocturnal!": 1, "I haven't lived this long to be beaten by you!": 1, "I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.": 1, "I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may be injured.": 1, "I haven't seen him in many years. I wonder what became of him...": 1, "I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.": 1, "I haven't seen the city in over fifty years. Even for a Dunmer, that seems like an eternity.": 1, "I guess so.": 1, "I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.": 1, "I guess not. ": 1, "I certainly hope so.": 1, "I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten. ": 1, "I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf.": 1, "I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.": 1, "I haven't heard that name in a long time.": 1, "I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.": 1, "I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems.": 1, "I could have sworn...oh well.": 1, "A Silt Strider carapace is so strong it can withstand the harshest of weather.": 1, "I guess we also owe you something for locking you up. Here, my family's ring. And everything the guards confiscated from you.": 1, "I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...": 1, "I could have left it behind. I could have put it back where it came from.": 1, "I haven't changed my mind, if that's what you're asking. I won't leave Whiterun defenseless, even for a day.": 1, "I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.": 1, "I don't know what you overheard, but the Riverwood Trader is still open. Feel free to shop.": 1, "I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.": 1, "I guess this is it. Wish me luck.": 1, "I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.": 1, "I haven't even said what it is.": 1, "I haven't figured it out yet, but I will.": 1, "I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.": 1, "I could do this all day. Here's your payment.": 1, "I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.": 1, "I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.": 1, "I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you. ": 1, "I could almost admire these Dwemer machines if they weren't so annoying.": 1, "I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.": 1, "I don't know what you're talking about. But if I were you, I'd hold my tongue.": 1, "I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf.": 1, "I commanded every vampire in the court to look for them, but after centuries of searching without success, I lost hope.": 1, "I could feed again.": 1, "I haven't seen you hunting in a while.": 1, "I guess it doesn't matter now. At least Isran is trying to do something noble with the name.": 1, "I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time.": 1, "I don't know why I decided to make my way to Solstheim to seek my fortune. I should have stayed home.": 1, "I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.": 1, "I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it.": 1, "I guess I'll see you at Fort Dawnguard.": 1, "I guess I shouldn't boast so much... it gets expensive!": 1, "I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you.": 1, "I don't know why, but I'm thinking about a temple, here on the island. Maybe it was just a bad dream.": 1, "I cannot stay. Not here, not in Whiterun. It likely won't be safe for Avulstein, either.": 1, "I cannot say for certain which is currently protecting me, but it bears further investigation at some point.": 1, "I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.": 1, "I hear that name, and I see a temple, here on Solstheim. What could that mean?": 1, "I don't know why I bother.": 1, "I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the way things are going around here.": 1, "I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.": 1, "I don't know why... but I actually believe you. You've got the look of someone who's just seen a dragon.": 1, "I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though.": 1, "I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.": 1, "I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun.": 1, "I guess I expected too much from you.": 1, "I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.": 1, "I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.": 1, "I guess I can look the other way, this time.": 1, "I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons.": 1, "I cannot maintain the barrier for much longer.": 1, "I guess I should join you more often.": 1, "I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals.": 1, "I cannot thank you enough for all of the help.": 1, "I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken. ": 1, "I guess it could be worse. But... I'm sick of sleeping outside with the horses. I want a real home, real parents. Not... this.": 1, "I certainly don't expect it to have quite the same results. I'm no tonal architect, of course!": 1, "I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years.": 1, "I certainly do.": 1, "I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride? ": 1, "I don't know whether to kill it or pet it.": 1, "I haven't told him anything, of course. What I'm doing is far too important. Can't breathe a word of it.": 1, "I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.": 1, "I cast you to Oblivion!": 1, "I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend.": 1, "I don't know who sent you here, but you've given us something to build on here. I hope someday we can repay you for your kindness.": 1, "I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.": 1, "I cast you out!": 1, "I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.": 1, "I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.": 1, "I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?": 1, "I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.": 1, "I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?": 1, "I hear one of them, Nelacar, still hangs around the Frozen Hearth. Guess he has no where else to go, poor thing.": 1, "I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!": 1, "I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.": 1, "I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.": 1, "I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.": 1, "I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.": 1, "I guess I'm expected.": 1, "I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it.": 1, "I don't know. He never told me.": 1, "I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.": 1, "I can't thank you enough. Here, take this. It's not much, but please accept it as a token of my thanks.": 1, "I hope my son has found some nice, well-mannered girl to settle down with.": 1, "I can't guarantee you'd be free from harm. Becoming blind could be the least of your worries.": 1, "I don't mean to confuse you.": 1, "I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.": 1, "I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.": 1, "I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?": 1, "I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!": 1, "I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.": 1, "I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.": 1, "I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar.": 1, "I find your choice of words quite interesting considering that Serana is in far more danger now than she was following my \"foolish plan.\"": 1, "I hope monsters come and eat you.": 1, "I can't get them out.": 1, "I don't mind working at the Retching Netch, but I was hoping for a bit more when I moved to Solstheim. Ah well.": 1, "I can't get it open.": 1, "I can't get a bead on him!": 1, "I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!": 1, "I don't much like him, but I can't allow the people of Skyrim to be preyed upon by those monsters.": 1, "I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value.": 1, "I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.": 1, "I hope one day to see it restored to its former glory.": 1, "I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.": 1, "I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now.": 1, "I don't need luck, I need rest.": 1, "I can't get them out!": 1, "I don't need so many, but thank you, Tharstan. You are as sweet as honey from the comb.": 1, "I hope life's treating you well, friend.": 1, "I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him.": 1, "I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.": 1, "I can't imagine that opinion has changed.": 1, "I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.": 1, "I hope Master Neloth can explain this.": 1, "I don't mean to be rude outsider, but I must get back to the village.": 1, "I found an unsent letter he'd written to the East Empire Company, and a key.": 1, "I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.": 1, "I found a willing subject for you. Payment has already been discussed, of course. ": 1, "I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.": 1, "I can't imagine living here. Or... being dead here. Or... whatever they'd call it. Ugh.": 1, "I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!": 1, "I hope it's worth it.": 1, "I can't imagine Skald ever being young.": 1, "I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again.": 1, "I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper.": 1, "I can't help that space is cramped in here, Florentius.": 1, "I don't mean to be rude, but I need to concentrate.": 1, "I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure.": 1, "I can't help it if I have a black thumb. It's like the mushrooms hate me.": 1, "I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed \"plot.\"": 1, "I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.": 1, "I can't help but wonder if this place has some connection to the history of the Skaal.": 1, "I hope in his next life, he's reborn as an Argonian forced to live in a slum because of some bigoted Nord dictator.": 1, "I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.": 1, "I can't hold these things! We need to leave!": 1, "I hope she finds what she needs out there.": 1, "I find these parties such a dreadful bore.": 1, "I find them, clean them up and resell them.": 1, "I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.": 1, "I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.": 1, "I don't really have time for this.": 1, "I can't decide which parts of you I'd like to keep for a while...": 1, "I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.": 1, "I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.": 1, "I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.": 1, "I finally bit off more than I could chew.": 1, "A butler's work is never done.": 1, "I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.": 1, "I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.": 1, "I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.": 1, "I figured it would be more of an issue for you.": 1, "I fight... because I must.": 1, "I don't recall asking you to kill Miraak. That was your own project.": 1, "I fight. I protect the hall. I bring in meat. And I think I could take on most of the tree lovers up in the Skaal Village.": 1, "I can't believe you found a way to reopen the mines. I don't know how to thank you.": 1, "A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm.": 1, "I hope that you can make my son see wisdom.": 1, "I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?": 1, "I don't recall inviting you into my tower. I do hope you make this worth my while.": 1, "I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. ": 1, "I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.": 1, "I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?": 1, "I don't recall addressing you, worm.": 1, "I can't deny the man is right about a few things...": 1, "I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time.": 1, "I don't plan on being killed by the likes of you.": 1, "I can't express how much easier you've made my job.": 1, "I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.": 1, "I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?": 1, "I don't need to know if it's fresh from this distance.": 1, "I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice.": 1, "I find that highly unlikely... but the court will love it. I'm writing it in.": 1, "I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so.": 1, "I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.": 1, "I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help.": 1, "I can't even begin to imagine how much time she spent in this room. Doesn't look too cozy.": 1, "I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.": 1, "I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.": 1, "I find that highly unlikely... I think it would be irresponsible to write that in to the verse.": 1, "I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.": 1, "I hope so. The Legion is Skyrim's only hope right now. Come on, we'd better get moving.": 1, "I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.": 1, "I find it tiring to converse with someone in that form. Too much effort.": 1, "I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?": 1, "I don't need your help.": 1, "I can't do everything for you.": 1, "I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.": 1, "I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is.": 1, "I don't owe you money, do I?": 1, "I hope that Nikulas will hear your words. He no longer seems to hear mine.": 1, "I find it hard to believe he's changed his mind. He said some very hurtful things to me before I left.": 1, "I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.": 1, "I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful.": 1, "I don't like you... I think you're a heretic.": 1, "I don't like where this is going.": 1, "I heard... a voice in my head. It told me to bring the cultists to Windhelm. I didn't want to do it, but I did it anyway. I couldn't control myself.": 1, "I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon.": 1, "I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.": 1, "I don't know. Someone in town said it.": 1, "I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense.": 1, "I can't take this much longer.": 1, "I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong.": 1, "I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk.": 1, "I help in the mines as well as the forge.": 1, "I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon.": 1, "I don't know. There are many who would've already expected us to leave this place.": 1, "I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.": 1, "I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.": 1, "I help my father in more ways than people realize.": 1, "I don't know. When I asked her where she was going she just muttered \"Where the end began.\"": 1, "I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.": 1, "I don't know... Did we build that?": 1, "I don't know... I don't want to do anything that might offend Elenwen. There is a lot of money at stake, after all.": 1, "I don't know... I feel strange just thinking about it. A temple, maybe? Here on the island? Something about a temple...": 1, "I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!": 1, "I get so lonely out here.": 1, "I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.": 1, "I can't speak now, friend. I must return home.": 1, "I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.": 1, "I don't know. What'd he look like?": 1, "I can't talk now. I must get back to the village.": 1, "I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?": 1, "I don't know. If you see any big strong men around, let us know, will you?": 1, "I don't know. I can't remember everything clearly.": 1, "I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power.": 1, "I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit.": 1, "I heard what's going on. The vampires, the Dawnguard, all of it. I wanted to help, so here I am.": 1, "A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant.": 1, "I don't know. I feel like I knew something about it, but now I can't remember.": 1, "I don't know. I honestly don't know. After all these years, it's a miracle even this much survived.": 1, "I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full.": 1, "I don't know. I keep thinking of the Earth Stone... Something to do with that. ": 1, "I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.": 1, "I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.": 1, "I can't thank you enough for what you did. ": 1, "I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence.": 1, "I can't thank you enough for reopening the ebony mines. You've brought light to the darkness, my friend.": 1, "I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...": 1, "I get them fresh from the farms daily, Nazeem.": 1, "I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.": 1, "I don't know. I... maybe? It's what... it's what he wanted. He just needed their energy.": 1, "I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone.": 1, "I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it.": 1, "I can't tell you how relieved I am that Miraak's gone from my mind. I appreciate what you've done.": 1, "I can't tell if he expects me to blow myself up, or to try and murder him. But he clearly doesn't trust any of us.": 1, "I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.": 1, "A bit melodramatic, even for you Laila.": 1, "I can't talk right now.": 1, "I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit.": 1, "I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?": 1, "I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.": 1, "I can't see you, Reyda! I can't find you! Why are you hiding? Hiding, hide, hide, hide! Don't make me sad!": 1, "I gave them no such pleasure.": 1, "I gathered some plants that are useful for making potions, but I have other goods as well.": 1, "I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.": 1, "I don't like the feel of this place. I'll wait for you back by the entrance.": 1, "I can't remember when I last slept...": 1, "I found this. I thought you might like it.": 1, "I found them near the old Dwemer bridge in the far west. I'll mark it down for you on your map for a small fee.": 1, "I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.": 1, "I don't like the look of this...": 1, "I hope Geldis proved useful. Have you made any progress?": 1, "I can't really remember... I think I knew at one time, but now I'm not sure.": 1, "I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it.": 1, "I found their \"reading room\" in the ruins of Nchardak. The book is there, but it's sealed in a protective case which I wasn't able to open.": 1, "A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me.": 1, "I can't pay you, but I could teach you the Ash Guardian spell... although maybe that doesn't sound like a good idea to you after this.": 1, "I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.": 1, "I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now.": 1, "I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.": 1, "I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...": 1, "I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard.": 1, "I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!": 1, "I can't keep helping you with everything. ": 1, "I hope I have something that interests you. I always wish to be of service.": 1, "A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.": 1, "I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.": 1, "I hope Elynea has something to help me sleep at night.": 1, "I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know.": 1, "I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold.": 1, "I help, I do the chores. What else would you have me do?": 1, "I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.": 1, "I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.": 1, "I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in Falkreath hold. Talk to my steward if you're interested.": 1, "I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.": 1, "I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.": 1, "I hesitate to ask for anything else. Your family's done so much for us already.": 1, "I don't like doing business with Azura's faithful. Make it quick.": 1, "I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him.": 1, "I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway.": 1, "I honor my lord by destroying you!": 1, "I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer.": 1, "I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace.": 1, "I don't like him any more than you do. But he is my father.": 1, "I hope Alva is not what you think.": 1, "I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters.": 1, "A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own.": 1, "I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.": 1, "I hope Alvide doesn't think less of me, but I can't protect her on my own. We're safer here.": 1, "I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.": 1, "I can't say that I'm surprised by your answer. Until I get my second volume published, no one will ever know of my achievements.": 1, "I hope Councilor Morvayn will still be alive when you decide to return.": 1, "I hope Elynea has something for headaches.": 1, "I can't say it surprises me. I kind of figured we were heading for this some day.": 1, "I don't like strangers...": 1, "I don't like being out in the open like this.": 1, "I could learn a lot from the people in this room.": 1, "I could listen to her play all day.": 1, "I guess we should have seen this coming... Moth Priest, moths... they're apparently related in some way.": 1, "I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible.": 1, "I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?": 1, "I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.": 1, "I do, and if you count yourself among their numbers then you've blood on your hands as well.": 1, "I do! Thank you.": 1, "I hate this game.": 1, "I have much to learn yet from Storn, if I am to one day become the shaman.": 1, "I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything.": 1, "I do the cookin' and cleanin' round the palace.": 1, "I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?": 1, "I hate this ash. It gets into everything.": 1, "I do. I want to know what happened to Gratian, and what the East Empire Company is keeping from all of us.": 1, "I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself.": 1, "I do so love dealing with mortals.": 1, "I hate them.": 1, "I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?": 1, "I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.": 1, "I hate most of the travelers that come through here, but you've shown yourself as one of the better ones.": 1, "I do not wish to imagine the kinds of things that happened in this chamber. Who were the poor souls trapped in these cages?": 1, "I do not understand. Why would he send you, an outsider, to find me when he knows why I have come here?": 1, "I do not think that is wise.": 1, "I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.": 1, "I hate it. Everyone feels sorry for me, so they don't treat me too bad, but...": 1, "I do not recognize this statuary. We passed by a few of them earlier, but they are becoming more frequent as we get further in.": 1, "I have my doubts. But the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now... reduced to this.": 1, "I have my ways, but it's not easy these days.": 1, "I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.": 1, "I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here!": 1, "I have kept my end of the bargain, now I expect you to keep yours.": 1, "A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?": 1, "I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face.": 1, "I have learned some of what he knows, but it is not my place to divulge anything to an outsider.": 1, "I do... I do indeed.": 1, "I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.": 1, "I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!": 1, "I don't have any gold to pay you with, but I can give you this staff.": 1, "I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur.": 1, "I have letters to read.": 1, "I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.": 1, "I do. I've received some information from my sources that there could be elements of Ulen's house, House Hlaalu, already in Raven Rock.": 1, "I hate to break it to you, but there isn't a scrap of ebony left in the mines. You might want to just move on.": 1, "I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available.": 1, "I have made it quite clear that my only role here is as an advisor to the Arch-Mage.": 1, "I do. So few people possess the taste and sophistication of a proper wardrobe these days.": 1, "I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.": 1, "I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art.": 1, "I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.": 1, "I do. It's how the vampire has survived for millennia, and the only way we can continue to survive in the future.": 1, "I don't have anything to say.": 1, "I do. It is I, Bujold. You blessed me in the past, and now I've rid the hall of Rieklings and returned it to its rightful owners.": 1, "I don't have much of a reputation in Skyrim yet, but I'm working on that, one sweet lady at a time. Haha!": 1, "I don't have much to give in reward, but return to me when the task is done and I'll do what I can. Thank you, Skaal-friend.": 1, "I do. Still want to buy it?": 1, "I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.": 1, "I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding.": 1, "I hate it here. I... I wanna go home.": 1, "I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.": 1, "I don't have time to go traipsing all over Solstheim.": 1, "I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!": 1, "I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.": 1, "I do know that heart stones sometimes raise ash spawn from the bits of bone buried in the nearby ash.": 1, "I do indeed.": 1, "I don't have to know what you are to kill you.": 1, "I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think.": 1, "I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.": 1, "I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.": 1, "I don't have to take that from you!": 1, "I hardly felt a thing.": 1, "I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery.": 1, "I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.": 1, "I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.": 1, "I do hope you know what your doing with those flames. It would be quite a shame if something caught fire.": 1, "I do hope you know what you're doing with those flames...": 1, "I have no idea what to do!": 1, "I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa.": 1, "I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that.": 1, "I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.": 1, "I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.": 1, "I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad.": 1, "I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry.": 1, "I don't have to take this from the likes of you.": 1, "I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.": 1, "I do miss that helmet....": 1, "I do my best to counsel my people, but I cannot allay their fears.": 1, "I do not practice my art for free, however. I doubt you can afford my services. You have the smell of the vagabond about you.": 1, "I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.": 1, "I do not like this place. It almost looks as if these statues will come to life at any moment.": 1, "I have never doubted that, husband.": 1, "I do not like fish.": 1, "I have never understood the Nord fascination with weapons. Magic is so much more versatile, don't you think?": 1, "I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.": 1, "I don't have time for this nonsense.": 1, "I do not know what it is Miraak learned that gave him reason to turn on his masters.": 1, "I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.": 1, "I do not know this word Thalmor, but if you mean the elves, they were trying to learn the secrets of forging Stalhrim.": 1, "I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!": 1, "I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us.": 1, "I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.": 1, "I hate giving speeches.": 1, "I do not fear you, Dovahkiin!": 1, "I have no business with you. Leave me.": 1, "I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do.": 1, "I do not fear death.": 1, "I hardly think the bears are clever enough to hold a grudge against you, Miss Temba.": 1, "I have no choice. As I told you before, I'm a Daughter of Coldharbour.": 1, "I do not fear death!": 1, "I have no desire to seek religion.": 1, "I have no doubt that lever turns these blades off. I shall wait here for now.": 1, "I do not blame you. I know he chose this. I just wish he had seen another way.": 1, "I don't appreciate loiterers, if that's what you're here to do.": 1, "I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.": 1, "I don't believe it. I guess you were right!": 1, "I don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you.": 1, "I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.": 1, "I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.": 1, "I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.": 1, "I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!": 1, "I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost.": 1, "I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme.": 1, "I have a long way to go before I'm ready for the kind of advanced magic I've been attempting.": 1, "I have a letter here from Quintus Navale in Windhelm. He said it was urgent.": 1, "I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!": 1, "I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.": 1, "I don't care what Beem says. It's high time we get in there and find our fortune.": 1, "I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.": 1, "I have done all that can be done. There is nothing left.": 1, "I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that.": 1, "I have a few very detailed missives from border patrols, beginning with Fifth Irregulars' reports on the movements of....": 1, "I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.": 1, "I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over.": 1, "I don't care much for the war one way or the other.": 1, "I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.": 1, "I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person.": 1, "I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me.": 1, "I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?": 1, "I have a few things laying around that weren't worth adding to the collection. You may look through them.": 1, "I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.": 1, "I have a letter here for you.": 1, "I have a lot to do around the farm, so make it quick please. What is it you wanted?": 1, "I have been taken against my will! I am in need of rescue!": 1, "I have been preparing for it all my life. There is no question that I'm ready, but...": 1, "I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance.": 1, "I have a staff for you, but I would also like to make you a member of my household. A member of House Telvanni.": 1, "I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.": 1, "I have a very close relationship with Savos Aren, the current Arch-Mage.": 1, "I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.": 1, "I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one.": 1, "I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?": 1, "I don't care, a deal's a deal.": 1, "I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant.": 1, "I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that. ": 1, "I don't converse with my meals.": 1, "I don't converse with my prey.": 1, "I have a prison to run.": 1, "I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.": 1, "I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.": 1, "A bit ripe, isn't it? Here. Take this.": 1, "I have already defeated your friends once. Beyn. I do not fear them.": 1, "I have a present for you. A nice, shiny present.": 1, "I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.": 1, "I have an alternative for you, if you'd be interested.": 1, "I have an idea. I'll wait here and retrieve this cube once you find the last one we need. Good luck!": 1, "I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.": 1, "I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading. ": 1, "I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone.": 1, "I don't care where she is. Go get her. Now.": 1, "I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking.": 1, "I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.": 1, "I have everything I need right here.": 1, "I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.": 1, "I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.": 1, "I don't expect you to be capable of even that.": 1, "I don't expect you to know what that means. ": 1, "I have gone to some pains to ensure that I am immune to many forms of control. ": 1, "I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too.": 1, "I have goods to offer, if you have need.": 1, "I don't fear hardship and danger. I am Skaal. The only thing that I fear is not to follow my heart, and to die an old man filled with regret.": 1, "A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist.": 1, "I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about.": 1, "I have a choice?": 1, "I don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland.": 1, "I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items.": 1, "I have herbs to mix.": 1, "I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.": 1, "I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do.": 1, "I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.": 1, "I don't blame you.": 1, "I don't go down easy if you raise your hand against me again.": 1, "I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere.": 1, "I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes.": 1, "I don't believe you. That's not your way.": 1, "I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.": 1, "I don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before.": 1, "I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin.": 1, "I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.": 1, "A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed.": 1, "I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.": 1, "I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.": 1, "I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem.": 1, "I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.": 1, "I don't even know what to think anymore...": 1, "I don't care if he's a Master Wizard. He can't treat me like this!": 1, "I don't even know who that is... ": 1, "I don't even know who they said I killed.": 1, "I don't care how much you're paying me, there's no way I'm doing that.": 1, "I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.": 1, "A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.": 1, "I have a favor to ask of you, Tharstan.": 1, "I don't care how many Colleges they build, or how much the sea swallows up. I'll outlast them all.": 1, "I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.": 1, "I don't care about politics. You want to fight over the throne with the rest of them, go right ahead.": 1, "I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.": 1, "I don't buy that story, either.": 1, "I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.": 1, "I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it.": 1, "I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.": 1, "I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.": 1, "I have feasted on many greater than you.": 1, "I have found such a soul and the stars appear cooperative.": 1, "I don't even want to think about what those... creatures are doing with my fires.": 1, "I have friends in Raven Rock, and a few among the Skaal. There's not much metal on the island itself, but we can find what we need, when we need it.": 1, "A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.": 1, "I have given my answer, little cub. I know you are brave and have the heart of a great she-wolf, but all things have a time and place.": 1, "I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.": 1, "I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions.": 1, "I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.": 1, "I do hope it's true. So many opportunities...": 1, "I have things I should see to, but go ahead.": 1, "I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way.": 1, "I have things to study, what is it?": 1, "I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...": 1, "I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city.": 1, "I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.": 1, "I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.": 1, "I count the nobility of both the Empire and the Dominion among my clients.": 1, "I count my blessings every day.": 1, "I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.": 1, "I have to admit, I'm impressed. I didn't think you had the spirit for it.": 1, "I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.": 1, "I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.": 1, "I have to get back home.": 1, "I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.": 1, "I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.": 1, "I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?": 1, "I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!": 1, "I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?": 1, "I have to remember... ward first, then summon.": 1, "I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.": 1, "I couldn't be more pleased. Take this small token of my appreciation.": 1, "I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand.": 1, "I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.": 1, "I have to be. As Second Councilor, the security of Raven Rock is my primary concern.": 1, "I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?": 1, "I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this.": 1, "I had a bad dream again last night.": 1, "I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.": 1, "I did not ask for that! No more magic.": 1, "I did indeed. When are you going to do something about our central Ancestral Tomb? I can't even go down there any longer. It's getting intolerable!": 1, "I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help.": 1, "I had a map, in my journal. That's where we should start.": 1, "I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest.": 1, "I had a friend over there, a dark elf named Vanryth... a very talented armorsmith.": 1, "I don't know if I can do this anymore, Modyn.": 1, "I despise your presence, mortal!": 1, "I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.": 1, "I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.": 1, "I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.": 1, "I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!": 1, "I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary.": 1, "I definitely missed the forge. I wonder if it missed me.": 1, "I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.": 1, "I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I doubt I'd have made it out myself if not for my friend here.": 1, "I daresay you've learned all I can teach you.": 1, "I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak.": 1, "I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.": 1, "I don't know if they were right to execute him for what he did, but I'll tell you something...": 1, "I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.": 1, "I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?": 1, "I had a feeling you'd be willing to listen to me.": 1, "I don't know that name. You say she's Jarl of Solitude? Who supports her?": 1, "I could, but I won't.": 1, "I could use your help.": 1, "I don't know what spell you freed us from, outsider, but I thank you.": 1, "I could see through my eyes, but I could not control my actions.": 1, "I could see it in your eyes. You looked about a thousand leagues away.": 1, "I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.": 1, "I have your list of soul gems, but nothing else.": 1, "I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!": 1, "I could really use some more experience in the field. I'd be happy to join you again, and it won't cost a thing.": 1, "I guess you had your reasons.": 1, "I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.": 1, "I guess you get used to it.": 1, "I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!": 1, "I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?": 1, "I could never leave Adril behind, and he will never leave Lleril.": 1, "I guess you don't have potatoes in your ears after all. Just make sure we get a fresh batch in soon.": 1, "I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.": 1, "I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?": 1, "I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.": 1, "I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?": 1, "I don't know what we'd do without him. Send him my thanks.": 1, "I don't know what you did in those mines, but it put a smile on Crescius's face. I've never seen him so happy.": 1, "I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!": 1, "I could never hope to approach her.": 1, "I could listen to him play all day.": 1, "I have. There was a time, years ago, when we were both members of the Vigilants, and both equally dissatisfied with them.": 1, "I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us.": 1, "I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.": 1, "I could sure use some coin.": 1, "I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...": 1, "I could use some help over here!": 1, "I could use a hand here.": 1, "I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.": 1, "I don't know what a Moth Priest is, but I did see an old man in a robe not long ago. He was riding in a wagon with some Imperial guards.": 1, "I have to see her. Please, excuse me.": 1, "I could travel to Raven Rock and purchase some more.": 1, "I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine...": 1, "I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it.": 1, "I guess... we kind of have to go way back. To the very beginning. Do you know where vampirism came from?": 1, "I guess you're smarter than you look.": 1, "I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.": 1, "I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.": 1, "I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.": 1, "I could swing a pickaxe better than any man in the mines. Made thousands of coins. Now it's all gone.": 1, "I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off.": 1, "I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business.": 1, "I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.": 1, "A Moth Priest? What in Oblivion do you need a Moth Priest for?": 1, "I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked.": 1, "I guess you'll never get to find out.": 1, "I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!": 1, "I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.": 1, "I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.": 1, "I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine.": 1, "I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.": 1, "I have spread false rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth Priest here.": 1, "I had always just assumed that the other tower was completely destroyed inside.": 1, "I did not wish her to risk herself, and I worry for her safety. If you could find her and see that she is safe, I would be grateful.": 1, "I have spoken. The Rotmulaag waits.": 1, "I had quite the mentor. He taught me everything he know about the nirnroot and its strange properties.": 1, "I have nothing more to say to you.": 1, "I didn't think you'd get pinched.": 1, "I didn't think you were going to survive that fall, let alone those things that were down there.": 1, "I didn't think you had the stomach for it.": 1, "I have nothing to say to you. Just... leave me alone.": 1, "I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack.": 1, "I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice.": 1, "I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us...": 1, "I have one. A nephew. He's in prison for being a member of the Forsworn.": 1, "I have ordered the court to assemble. I have a new task for us all to carry out, and that includes you.": 1, "I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide.": 1, "I had particularly high hopes for her. Once she'd overcome her difficulties, she could have been quite successful here.": 1, "I have overcome my nature only through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice.": 1, "I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry.": 1, "I didn't take you for a coward. But until we know the limits of our courage, we don't really know ourselves.": 1, "I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead.": 1, "I have plenty of room in my bed.": 1, "I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.": 1, "I didn't say that. I wondered if perhaps he did it for the attention, but every now and then he'll say something that makes me reconsider.": 1, "I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here? ": 1, "I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?": 1, "I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills.": 1, "I had no idea you felt that way about me, Serana. It was never my intention to push you aside.": 1, "I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.": 1, "I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us.": 1, "I have not always been a ragged beggar. I learned my art from the masters of the art of flesh sculpture.": 1, "I didn't touch it!": 1, "I have no more business with you.": 1, "I have no problem killing you. How do you feel about dying?": 1, "I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.": 1, "I do have a staff I could give you instead, if you think the Ash Guardian spell is too risky.": 1, "I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either.": 1, "I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive.": 1, "I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business.": 1, "I had to get this for you when I saw it. I hope you like it.": 1, "I do enjoy sharing stories of my travels in Tamriel with young Nikulas.": 1, "I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion.": 1, "I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!": 1, "I have no time or patience for a student. Perhaps the College of Winterhold will grant you admission.": 1, "I had to clean out the riff-raff last time I was here, too. Where do they come from?": 1, "I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions.": 1, "I have no time to speak now, outsider. I'm on my way home.": 1, "I had thought better of you.": 1, "I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here.": 1, "I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.": 1, "I discovered too late that the Ideal Masters favor deception over honor and had no intention of releasing me from my binding.": 1, "I disagree.": 1, "I die, serving my homeland...": 1, "I die for my people.": 1, "I didn't want you to think I was one of those... you know, the women who just sit in their castle all day?": 1, "I didn't want to, but she attacked to try and keep me from leaving.": 1, "I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific.": 1, "I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children...": 1, "I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course.": 1, "I have records I need to tend to.": 1, "I had no idea that her laboratory even existed.": 1, "I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again.": 1, "I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.": 1, "I didn't expect to see you again. What became of my doting husband?": 1, "I didn't even think you knew what a book was, my brutish friend.": 1, "I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.": 1, "I didn't even know the crests could be removed. Maybe my mother's trying to tell us something?": 1, "I didn't do it! You saw! I didn't do it!": 1, "I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.": 1, "I did. Strange days when the monks will do that. I wonder what it means.": 1, "I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland.": 1, "I did. But something about you makes me think I can trust you. I hope I'm not wrong.": 1, "I have some things that belonged to my daughter, Friga. She... she won't be needing them any more.": 1, "I had heard Miraak had turned against the Dragon Cult, but to display the remains in such a manner as this...": 1, "I did, in fact. Quite perceptive of you.": 1, "I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought.": 1, "I did what needed to be done. Nothing more.": 1, "I don't know how you made it this far, but you'll go no farther.": 1, "I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!": 1, "I did that engraved piece just last month!": 1, "I have something I want to give to you. Here.": 1, "I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.": 1, "I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention!": 1, "I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on.": 1, "I have spent my entire life searching for it. ": 1, "I had expected Ysgramor's city to be... bigger.": 1, "I don't know how you do it, getting them into that pen and putting armor on them. A very special relationship, clearly.": 1, "A bold but foolish move.": 1, "I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.": 1, "I had no choice, don't you see?": 1, "I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped!": 1, "I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.": 1, "I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.": 1, "I have seen more wolves and bears among the trees since the last dark moon. Something is driving them north into our lands.": 1, "I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.": 1, "I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil. ": 1, "I have served you for long enough. Tiidi do ahmik oblaan.": 1, "I have several elixirs for sale.": 1, "I had my suspicions that he was undead. How else could he have survived for over 200 years?": 1, "I had just moved from my ancestral home in Morrowind to the continent of Cyrodiil.": 1, "I don't know how he drinks that stuff.": 1, "I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.": 1, "I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak. ": 1, "I have silver to bend.": 1, "I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing.": 1, "I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?": 1, "I had hoped you would have chosen a higher profile target. But the deed is done, and it's effect secured.": 1, "I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...": 1, "I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.": 1, "I have some associates and correspondents who find things for me. One of them has a credible rumor on where this book might be.": 1, "I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me.": 1, "I have some cubes I'm sure you're going to need.": 1, "I didn't know it when we were... with each other... but Alain is actually the leader of a band of cutthroats. Bandits.": 1, "I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.": 1, "I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.": 1, "A cadre of lesser beasts has become a nuisance, taking too bold an approach to their feeding.": 1, "I have a task that will test your new powers, but first, do you have any questions?": 1, "I can't believe you came for me!": 1, "I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.": 1, "I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?": 1, "I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.": 1, "I can't be sure. I know I've heard that name, but it... it doesn't feel real. Does that make any sense?": 1, "I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?": 1, "I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.": 1, "I hope to see you again soon.": 1, "I don't think anyone's ever met the Ideal Masters. I'm not even sure anyone knows what they look like.": 1, "I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.": 1, "I can't bear it... make it stop...": 1, "I can't believe Fastred ran off to Riften with that... that bastard.": 1, "I feel I owe you my life for thwarting the House Hlaalu plot to have me assassinated. My deepest thanks.": 1, "I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.": 1, "I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.": 1, "I don't want to be hurt again!": 1, "I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood...": 1, "I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.": 1, "I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected.": 1, "I hope to get into the Bards College one day.": 1, "I can't believe I got caught.": 1, "I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose.": 1, "I hope this isn't something I did.": 1, "I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee.": 1, "I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.": 1, "A cave. Dark. Dangerous.": 1, "I hope this is important... I get little sleep as it is.": 1, "I hope this is important.": 1, "I hope this is important, I have an experiment I'm working on.": 1, "I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.": 1, "I don't think Rikke even knows my name. Probably because I'm not \"The Dragonborn.\"": 1, "I enjoy steady patronage in the Bannered Mare. I do hope you'll watch me perform.": 1, "I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs.": 1, "A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.": 1, "I feed when I'm hungry, I sleep when I'm tired, and I kill whenever I'm in the mood. Those are the things that are important to me.": 1, "I don't visit there often anymore, but we still get the occasional supply ship and visitors from there.": 1, "I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.": 1, "I hope we didn't offend him somehow.": 1, "I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?": 1, "I hope we can go home soon. I don't like it here.": 1, "I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.": 1, "I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos.": 1, "I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.": 1, "I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.": 1, "I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?": 1, "I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.": 1, "I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.": 1, "I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes.": 1, "I can be trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is always wise to mistrust a dovah.": 1, "I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.": 1, "I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.": 1, "I don't think he even sees me as his daughter anymore. I'm just... a means to an end.": 1, "I enjoyed our talk.": 1, "I feared that it would be so.": 1, "I can always use the practice.": 1, "I can appreciate that this... thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying.": 1, "I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!": 1, "I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.": 1, "I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!": 1, "I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day.": 1, "I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.": 1, "I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know.": 1, "I don't think going back is a good idea.": 1, "I can't afford to make any assumptions. That's how people wind up dead.": 1, "I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!": 1, "I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!": 1, "I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is. ": 1, "I don't think so!": 1, "I don't want to choose! They're both so amazing.": 1, "I feel like I can beat anything.": 1, "I hope you've read the first volume of my epic by now.": 1, "I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.": 1, "I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!": 1, "I came from three generations of miners, and I couldn't get anyone to believe me.": 1, "I feel like we've done this before, but that just means we're getting good at it. ": 1, "I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.": 1, "I came across a few of my mother's old things not long ago. Among them was a necklace that my father gave to her when they were married.": 1, "I feel nothing but sympathy for the Betrayed, despite my actions against them.": 1, "I came a long way to kill you.": 1, "I don't think I like where this is going.": 1, "I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside. ": 1, "I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days.": 1, "I don't think Galmar even knows my name. Probably because I'm not \"The Dragonborn.\"": 1, "I can't believe Raven Rock Mine is open again. Finally, something worth defending.": 1, "I can't believe Miraak made us build those shrines. To take our free will like that... just horrible.": 1, "I called it home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live here. So was she.": 1, "I can't believe Varona is dead.": 1, "I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways.": 1, "I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?": 1, "I don't suppose you'll carry some of this for a while.": 1, "I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!": 1, "I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...": 1, "I hope you've reconsidered helping us. Councilor Morvayn's life may be depending on it.": 1, "I can't believe any of this is happening!": 1, "I can't believe how carelessly the dead are buried here. I can't imagine my body just rotting away like that.": 1, "I doubt very much that they'll hasten to exact revenge for freeing me from the ruins.": 1, "I call upon the powers of the sun, moons and stars. Ildari Sarothril, reveal yourself!": 1, "I hope the rest of the cubes are this easy to find. Although knowing the Dwemer, I rather doubt it.": 1, "I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.": 1, "I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now.": 1, "I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench. ": 1, "I don't want to hear about it. I want what I asked for.": 1, "I feel like it was a long time. Who is Skyrim's High King?": 1, "I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together.": 1, "I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.": 1, "I can't believe I lost those pages.": 1, "I can almost hear its heart.": 1, "I don't want to do this!": 1, "I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.": 1, "I can't believe I'm trading this for some dried up plants. Oh well, a sale's a sale.": 1, "I don't think I've come across more than a chunk or two in my lifetime, and smithing's my trade.": 1, "I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.": 1, "I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway.": 1, "I can actually assist you in that regard.": 1, "I don't want to either, but you're going to have to jump. I'll be... right behind you. Above you. Just go.": 1, "I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war. ": 1, "I hope you're not planning on picking my pocket.": 1, "I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.": 1, "I came here to study the history of Solstheim, but it's the Skaal who intrigue me the most.": 1, "I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.": 1, "I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed.": 1, "I dunno, Drahff. They'd skin us alive if they knew we were doin' this.": 1, "I don't want to have my spirit outstripped by some wanderer. So let's get up there and kill us some Rieklings!": 1, "I dunno, sounds like I should try it.": 1, "I hope you've got some coin.": 1, "I can't believe Kuvar would do that. To his own wife!": 1, "I don't want to get comfortable here. We need to be back up there.": 1, "I don't want to die. I can't die here!": 1, "I hope you're not trying to lord your abilities over me.": 1, "I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.": 1, "I enchanted the ring with a bit of ash from the last ash spawn attack.": 1, "I can't believe I've been stuck here this long.": 1, "I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off.": 1, "I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan.": 1, "I don't want to fight you again.": 1, "I can't believe I've finally made it here.": 1, "I can't abide Samuel's constant talk of his parents. \"They're coming for me.\" \"This is only temporary.\" The boy must accept his fate.": 1, "I hope we don't bump into any Forsworn around here. I heard they're as wild as a pack of beasts.": 1, "I can tell you're no stranger to the wilds. I'm sure we can meet your hunting needs.": 1, "I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.": 1, "I can see that disapproving look in your eye.": 1, "I can hardly wait.": 1, "I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.": 1, "I don't trust that man, and I don't want him here.": 1, "I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.": 1, "I can hardly believe it. This is it. We've actually found the Forge! At last!": 1, "I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family.": 1, "I hope you will give me word if you find anything about my brother.": 1, "I don't trust you, whelp. Keep that in mind.": 1, "I hope you have coin to spend, and you're not just here to gawk at my goods.": 1, "I can see that in my eagerness for adventure, I have forgotten my duties as a son and as a Skaal.": 1, "I can see that is no idle threat. Very well, we will depart the island once we have loaded the ship.": 1, "I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself.": 1, "I don't think you're quite ready yet. ": 1, "I hope you find life in the castle to be to your liking.": 1, "I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear.": 1, "I hope you enjoy your stay in Raven Rock.": 1, "I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.": 1, "I don't think so. Sorry. I would love to help you, but Elenwen can be very vindictive. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.": 1, "I can see that. This has been my life for a long time, though. Do you understand that much?": 1, "I don't think so. She said she wanted to stay awake in case the situation was resolved.": 1, "I can hardly believe it.": 1, "I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there.": 1, "I hope you will return to us soon with the news that justice has finally been done.": 1, "I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception.": 1, "I expect there's another riddle in here, along with a puzzle.": 1, "I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help. ": 1, "I hope you comprehend killing better than you comprehend speech.": 1, "I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.": 1, "I hope you find Lord Harkon's court to your liking.": 1, "I hope you know what you're doing.": 1, "I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.": 1, "I can hear your heart beating.": 1, "I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.": 1, "I don't think that's something you want. You're a little... I just don't think you're the type.": 1, "I don't think there's a need for that!": 1, "I can not return to the village until I have found the source of this evil. Will you come with me, further into this accursed temple?": 1, "I don't think that's needed, Horik. It's the same strategy we used for every major defense during the Great War. It'll serve just as well now.": 1, "I don't think this day is ever going to end.": 1, "I don't think that's how the Circle works. ": 1, "I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak.": 1, "I fashioned an amulet to guard me against whatever has taken hold of the Skaal, but it is the only one of its kind.": 1, "I can only assume the gates have been closed by now.": 1, "I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College.": 1, "I don't think we need that old ghost anymore.": 1, "I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed. ": 1, "I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur.": 1, "I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.": 1, "I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?": 1, "I don't think we've reached the top yet. I'd bet there's some kind of secret passage around here.": 1, "I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.": 1, "I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really.": 1, "I don't think you know how dangerous it is to say what you've just said. ": 1, "I can see Boethiah smiles in your heart.": 1, "I don't think that was a compliment.": 1, "I don't think you can ever be ready to kill your parent.": 1, "I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine.": 1, "I fear for what is to come.": 1, "I can pay you.": 1, "I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?": 1, "I can help you find out what that is.": 1, "I can help you get it, but first I must have your assistance.": 1, "I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...": 1, "I don't think you belong here.": 1, "I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked.": 1, "I can handle it. Just wish there was more mead, is all.": 1, "I can send you into Azura's Star as soon as you're ready.": 1, "I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?": 1, "I hope we reach Markarth soon.": 1, "I can tell you don't like me. Well guess what. I don't give a damn.": 1, "I can cut you loose inside. Come on!": 1, "I hope we reach Ancestor Glade soon.": 1, "I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that?": 1, "I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish.": 1, "I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Perhaps you're a wealthy one, too, hm?": 1, "I can crush skulls with the best of them. Let me show you a few things.": 1, "I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.": 1, "I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough.": 1, "I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.": 1, "I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon full of gold isn't good enough for you?": 1, "I hope you're enjoying the music, ma'am.": 1, "I hope you're enjoying the music, sir.": 1, "I don't understand. I thought the village was safe. What are we going to do now?": 1, "I hope we haven't just created a martyr.": 1, "I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice.": 1, "I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you.": 1, "I can call you back to my tower as often as I like.": 1, "I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?": 1, "I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that.": 1, "I fear what would have happened if you hadn't freed us.": 1, "I fear to think what would have happened if you hadn't saved me from the elves.": 1, "I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother.": 1, "I hope you're enjoying yourself.": 1, "I can certainly try.": 1, "I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final.": 1, "I don't think so, though it sounds like a name I've heard before...": 1, "I don't understand. This should produce some notable effect.": 1, "I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.": 1, "I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am.": 1, "I fear there is too much we do not yet know.": 1, "I don't suppose you have the gold yet?": 1, "I can do that! I did it yesterday!": 1, "I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend.": 1, "I can smell the blood. Good and sour.": 1, "I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword.": 1, "I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what.": 1, "I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon loaded with silver isn't good enough for you?": 1, "I hope you come up with that gold soon.": 1, "I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.": 1, "I can smell your fear.": 1, "I can still put up a fight!": 1, "I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.": 1, "I can take a hint, lad. You want to make some coin, come find me.": 1, "I can take a hint, lass. You want to make some coin, come find me.": 1, "I can take care of myself.": 1, "I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.": 1, "I hope you brought a little something for me.": 1, "I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.": 1, "I hope whatever you're going to do will work.": 1, "I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...": 1, "I can tell this is important to you. Would you... do you want me to be just a normal human?": 1, "I can do this all day!": 1, "I fear that my time here has taken its toll upon me. I share a bond with this dreaded place.": 1, "I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister.": 1, "I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it.": 1, "I can feel it. The Tree Stone is free again. The Oneness of the land is restored.": 1, "I fear that will be the way of it.": 1, "I don't understand why you let him do these things to you.": 1, "I can feel it. The balance of the living land has nearly been restored.": 1, "I can take you to any port on the coast.": 1, "I can feel my strength returning each time I am set free from that prison!": 1, "I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.": 1, "I can feel you laughing behind my back.": 1, "I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future... ": 1, "I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said.": 1, "I don't suppose you have some good news for me.": 1, "I expected too much. I'll seek someone else to salvage the family honor.": 1, "I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites.": 1, "I brought down as much as I could when we ran off, but it will only last so long.": 1, "I bring the might of House Redoran upon your head!": 1, "I can't believe it.": 1, "I doubt that was truly necessary.": 1, "I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.": 1, "I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father.": 1, "I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...": 1, "I bring death from the shadows!": 1, "I bid you safe travels.": 1, "I can't believe it. You're one of them... Talk to Isran. Maybe he can help you. Please, I don't want to have to kill you.": 1, "I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.": 1, "I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too.": 1, "I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left.": 1, "I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice.": 1, "I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least.": 1, "I can't believe that I was building that shrine at night... I never knew.": 1, "I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.": 1, "I can't believe we found my mother alive... well, you know what I mean.": 1, "I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived.": 1, "I don't suppose you could come back another time? I'm very busy.": 1, "I feel wonderful, just like every night.": 1, "I hope your luck changes soon, friend. I'll do what I can to keep the ash from burying your investment, but we'll need more to keep going.": 1, "I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.": 1, "I don't suppose it matters much anymore.": 1, "I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.": 1, "I hope you've reconsidered lending me a hand. Could really use it right now.": 1, "I don't see 'em any more.": 1, "I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves!": 1, "I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!": 1, "I don't want to step on anyone's toes. Come back to me when you're alone.": 1, "I better stay back and see to the old man. Good luck you two.": 1, "I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?": 1, "I doubt it can be repaired. You'll have to buy a new one.": 1, "I hunt soon. Go bother Majni.": 1, "I don't. All I know is that the ash spawn are coming from this direction, so this is as good a place to start as anywhere else.": 1, "I hope your stay in Markarth treats you better.": 1, "I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.": 1, "I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.": 1, "I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born.": 1, "I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.": 1, "I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.": 1, "I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.": 1, "I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms.": 1, "I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that.": 1, "I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now.": 1, "I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.": 1, "I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers.": 1, "I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?": 1, "I doubt that very much.": 1, "I hope the Caller turns you inside out!": 1, "I hunt. He talks. Go talk to him.": 1, "I bleed for the people of the Reach!": 1, "I feel terrible for the dead who end up here for eternity. Seems awful. Like they're still suffering.": 1, "I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.": 1, "I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?": 1, "I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls.": 1, "I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.": 1, "I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.": 1, "I doubt that an outsider could truly understand, but I hope my words have helped to answer your question.": 1, "I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.": 1, "I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe.": 1, "I don't see why. He's your problem now.": 1, "I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.": 1, "A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.": 1, "I don't want you to feel like I'm forcing you into this.": 1, "I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!": 1, "I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us.": 1, "I doubt my mother would waste her time with those fools.": 1, "I don't want you harassing Hilund anymore.": 1, "I don't want you hunting them again. You almost got killed last time.": 1, "I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.": 1, "I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths.": 1, "I doubt he'll be free, but all right.": 1, "I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.": 1, "A captive dragon, just think of the possibilities!": 1, "I immediately realized things must be pretty bad. Looks like I was right.": 1, "I better get back to sorting the dry goods.": 1, "I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them.": 1, "I don't suppose I could convince you to take care of it now, could I?": 1, "I don't relax. Ever.": 1, "A basic one? Of course. That is, assuming you know anything about steel smithing. It's pretty simple.": 1, "I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.": 1, "I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.": 1, "I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.": 1, "I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces.": 1, "I felt I had two choices. I could either live in fear of the night, or I could do something to help protect my people.": 1, "I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor. ": 1, "I don't want to see any of you get hurt.": 1, "I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.": 1, "I feel... unbeatable.": 1, "I bet your family would be amazed, right?": 1, "I don't remember seeing you at one of these before.": 1, "I can't believe we're doing this.": 1, "I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.": 1, "I don't want your apologies. I want Thirsk to live up to its name.": 1, "I hope the Empire is sending reinforcements to drive these heathens out of Whiterun.": 1, "I doubt there's any other place like it in Skyrim. It's beautiful.": 1, "I can't believe it. We... we actually found it!": 1, "I doubt it will fully stop whatever Miraak is doing, but it may slow his progress.": 1, "I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth.": 1, "I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.": 1, "I don't see the relevance.": 1, "I don't require an answer, Qahnaarin. Simply speak my name to the heavens when you feel the time is right.": 1, "I don't sail for free. Come back when you can actually pay me.": 1, "I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil.": 1, "I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. ": 2, "Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls.": 2, "I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care.": 2, "We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.": 2, "What would the Empire want in return?": 2, "His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg. ": 2, "Kill him!": 2, "Here in Shor's house we honor it still.": 2, "Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this.": 2, "We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.": 2, "When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak.": 2, "Kest...": 2, "Bless you, sera.": 2, "We will find her eventually.": 2, "Come back when you grow a backbone.": 2, "Banning said I could come play with his dogs. I want a dog.": 2, "Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.": 2, "His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains.": 2, "Bandits... the worst type of scum.": 2, "Khajiit has wares, if you have coin.": 2, "What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!": 2, "I'm just doing what I'm told.": 2, "Careful with that fire.": 2, "Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin.": 2, "I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.": 2, "Bleed!": 2, "I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.": 2, "Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs.": 2, "Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.": 2, "... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.": 2, "We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.": 2, "When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place.": 2, "Baroo?": 2, "Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell.": 2, "I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.": 2, "Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need.": 2, "Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.": 2, "We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.": 2, "Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.": 2, "Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?": 2, "Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim.": 2, "Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you.": 2, "Barbas, at your service.": 2, "We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.": 2, "Bless you, muthsera.": 2, "When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport.": 2, "We were told you may be coming.": 2, "His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side.": 2, "Keep your scales on.": 2, "When you find your nerves, then we'll talk.": 2, "Come back to me if you find anything.": 2, "You're not planning on hurting anyone with that weapon there, are you?": 2, "Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.": 2, "We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.": 2, "Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!": 2, "I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.": 2, "On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for your service.": 2, "On behalf of the Empire, and myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank.": 2, "Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed.": 2, "Between the cliff and Snapleg Cave there, I hate this stretch of road. There's an evil air up here. Getalong, horse.": 2, "Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?": 2, "Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.": 2, "Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.": 2, "What's mine is yours, Thane.": 2, "Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?": 2, "When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well.": 2, "We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?": 2, "Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.": 2, "Silence!": 2, "Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight.": 2, "Just pay them, Bersi!": 2, "Better get used to it. Snows most all the time in Windhelm.": 2, "What's the matter with you? We said keep it clean! Well, you can just forget about your payment.": 2, "Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.": 2, "When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power.": 2, "We want Hjaalmarch back, and Idgrod Ravencrone restored as Jarl.": 2, "We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile.": 2, "We want Kraldar removed as Jarl of Winterhold, and an Imperial candidate put in his place.": 2, "What's that supposed to mean?": 2, "Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.": 2, "When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.": 2, "His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him.": 2, "Better question would be \"what did he leave.\"": 2, "Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth.": 2, "I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.": 2, "Better than nothing, I guess. But Tullius will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Riften without a fight.": 2, "What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then... there really is hope after all?": 2, "We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.": 2, "Skyrim was betrayed, the blood of her sons spilled in doomed struggle against fate.": 2, "I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.": 2, "We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.": 2, "I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.": 2, "What's going on? What happened in there?": 2, "Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.": 2, "I'm not taking any visitors.": 2, "What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him.": 2, "His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.": 2, "Beyond these doors is the inner sanctum and the Skull of Corruption.": 2, "We were... very close.": 2, "Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?": 2, "Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need.": 2, "Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.": 2, "What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?": 2, "What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises?": 2, "Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.": 2, "Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.": 2, "Big talk for someone with a light purse.": 2, "I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat.": 2, "When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.": 2, "Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing.": 2, "You're not planning on using that weapon in here, I hope.": 2, "Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.": 2, "What's going on?!": 2, "I'll begin searching up here.": 2, "What's it say?": 2, "Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere.": 2, "Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.": 2, "...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire.": 2, "I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred-": 2, "Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.": 2, "Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself.": 2, "Hmm. The gate below still looks closed.": 2, "Bex!": 2, "Beware the dragon Durnehviir, destroyer of souls and harbinger of the fallen.": 2, "Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family.": 2, "Beware. Hermaeus Mora will betray you as he has me.": 2, "We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman.": 2, "I don't dare show my face, lest they recognize me, so you'll have to find out where they are. ": 2, "Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga.": 2, "Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.": 2, "I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.": 2, "What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?": 2, "Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you.": 2, "What was it you needed, again?": 2, "Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.": 2, "Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them.": 2, "Hhyyaarrggh!": 2, "Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?": 2, "What is it? What is it?": 2, "Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.": 2, "Bother someone else.": 2, "What is it? I haven't had much sleep.": 2, "We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.": 2, "What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?": 2, "You're not supposed to be in here.": 2, "I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.": 2, "I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?": 2, "Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer.": 2, "I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat. ": 2, "Kodlak did not care for vengeance.": 2, "Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.": 2, "I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.": 2, "I don't think you belong here. Does Master Neloth know about you?": 2, "Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.": 2, "Once your thrall is suitably sedated, you will be able to impart the gift without resistance.": 2, "I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do.": 2, "What is it with you and all these questions? Very well, ask away.": 2, "Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.": 2, "I'd say things couldn't be any better.": 2, "Here she is. ": 2, "Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.": 2, "I don't know if that's such a good idea...": 2, "We'll have to find another way around.": 2, "I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings.": 2, "Where are you going? Come back!": 2, "I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.": 2, "Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!": 2, "What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!": 2, "Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.": 2, "Somehow Master Neloth found out about the Ash Guardian. I'm terrified of what he's going to do.": 2, "Somehow I doubt that will persuade them.": 2, "What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.": 2, "What is this?": 2, "I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.": 2, "I don't know if we can outrun 'em.": 2, "Can't trust these things.": 2, "Hi Ma!": 2, "I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.": 2, "Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.": 2, "I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you.": 2, "What is it this time?": 2, "We'll see about that, won't we?": 2, "Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes.": 2, "We just need the shards of the blade and the hilt, now.": 2, "I'm on it, lass.": 2, "What in the Eight Divines is this thing?": 2, "We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now.": 2, "What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?": 2, "So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay.": 2, "You're not very good at this, are you.": 2, "What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!": 2, "We just need the hilt and the pommel, now.": 2, "Just leave me in peace.": 2, "What have you got for me today? Nothing illegal I hope!": 2, "You're not welcome here. Go.": 2, "Brilliant!": 2, "What have you done to me?": 2, "We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.": 2, "Krosis, the land below us is empty of prey.": 2, "Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.": 2, "Krosis, thuri. That is impossible.": 2, "Break our men out and head to the courtyard. We'll meet you there.": 2, "Make a thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without mercy.": 2, "Okie dokie, Listener.": 2, "I'm gonna join the Stormcloaks. They're the best!": 2, "Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own. ": 2, "What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!": 2, "Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.": 2, "I'll do it.": 2, "Braith. I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.": 2, "Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. ": 2, "Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.": 2, "A real home. A real family. I almost can't believe it.": 2, "Where are you hiding?": 2, "You're not going to get richer with that attitude.": 2, "Just let me know what needs doing.": 2, "Hey... we did pretty well for ourselves here. Good work.": 2, "What in the nine holds is that?": 2, "Where are you... get me down from this!": 2, "So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.": 2, "We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.": 2, "So I'm told. Try and keep up.": 2, "Bah. What's so good about it, hmm?": 2, "Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.": 2, "Hmm. Yes, here it is.": 2, "Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.": 2, "Just like Ysgramor himself. ": 2, "What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.": 2, "When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back.": 2, "Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman.": 2, "Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and would leave Whiterun dangerously exposed...": 2, "Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?": 2, "Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.": 2, "Help me out of here!": 2, "Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?": 2, "Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.": 2, "Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with.": 2, "Hmm. We could use the time to bring in new recruits. Our losses have been heavy recently...": 2, "I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved.": 2, "We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed.": 2, "We'd better find out what's happened.": 2, "Bandits are desperate men. They have nothing to lose, and they fight like it.": 2, "Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.": 2, "Sometimes being Master Neloth's apprentice is...painful.": 2, "Looks like the way out's up ahead. Come on.": 2, "Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.": 2, "What the... Don't do that!": 2, "Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath.": 2, "I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you.": 2, "I'll bury you in darkness!": 2, "When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame him.": 2, "We will see if they still remember us.": 2, "We will see if you truly have the gift.": 2, "We will see.": 2, "We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the All-Maker.": 2, "We know what path you've set him on. But he has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.": 2, "Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.": 2, "We know what path you've set her on. But she has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.": 2, "I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.": 2, "Come back when you have the coin.": 2, "I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things.": 2, "We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here. Remember that.": 2, "What troubles you, my son?": 2, "What troubles you, my daughter?": 2, "We won't return empty handed.": 2, "Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.": 2, "Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler.": 2, "When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame her.": 2, "What trickery is this?": 2, "I'm itching for a fight.": 2, "Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find.": 2, "What sort of power was that?": 2, "I'll carve you into pieces!": 2, "Kill.": 2, "When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either.": 2, "Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he.": 2, "What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?": 2, "Captain Gjalund does the business around here... I'm just a ship's mate.": 2, "Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, brother.": 2, "Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, sister.": 2, "Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now.": 2, "What matters is their heart.": 2, "Just look at this place. Is this what passes for a fort in Skyrim?": 2, "Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's.": 2, "I'm of a mind with Irileth.": 2, "Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do.": 2, "I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.": 2, "I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.": 2, "Hiding only prolongs your demise.": 2, "We'll get him when he comes back around. Hold your fire.": 2, "So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion.": 2, "Looking to fix your armor?": 2, "We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.": 2, "Sigh.": 2, "Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.": 2, "Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.": 2, "Sometimes it pays to look in every nook and cranny.": 2, "Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.": 2, "What some call devotion to the dark arts, I call foolishness.": 2, "We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.": 2, "I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter.": 2, "I'll claw the eyes out of whoever did this!": 2, "We'd better stick together down here.": 2, "Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.": 2, "What say you, Dragonborn?": 2, "I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.": 2, "Kill one of us, and three more will take their place. The Forsworn are unstoppable.": 2, "We'll be waiting to take her into custody.": 2, "You're short on coin.": 2, "I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans.": 2, "Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear.": 2, "I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.": 2, "Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder.": 2, "Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there.": 2, "We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart.": 2, "Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.": 2, "What now...": 2, "Bo pruzaan. Better to fly.": 2, "Help me! Help!": 2, "Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.": 2, "When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours?  Both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.": 2, "We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.": 2, "Clamoring in angry voices, calling out for justice, for war, they sat me on the throne.": 2, "We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe.": 2, "Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.": 2, "We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.": 2, "Just thinking that some madman was inside my mind. Gives me shivers just thinking about it.": 2, "You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same way.": 2, "Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive. ": 2, "Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?": 2, "Karliah?": 2, "Sit back and enjoy the ride.": 2, "I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.": 2, "Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.": 2, "Kawafoo.": 2, "What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about.": 2, "We need to talk.": 2, "Something to report?": 2, "I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.": 2, "Karliah? Then she's finally found it.": 2, "Sometimes I feel sorry for them. Master Neloth's experiments tend to be fatal.": 2, "Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.": 2, "Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent.": 2, "When finally set free, I returned to Windhelm, and was greeted by a city in mourning, at one with my own grief and anger.": 2, "Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place.": 2, "Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin.": 2, "Whatever you want. But let's go, now.": 2, "When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?": 2, "Clavicus sent you didn't he?": 2, "Whatever you say, boss.": 2, "Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.": 2, "Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing.": 2, "We must end the nightmares!": 2, "Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?": 2, "Clavicus gave him an axe.": 2, "Karliah's taught you nothing! Your lessons begin anew!": 2, "Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion.": 2, "Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?": 2, "Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them.": 2, "Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.": 2, "Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can.": 2, "Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.": 2, "Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude.": 2, "Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist.": 2, "What? You're... can it really be true? Dragonborn?": 2, "Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.": 2, "I'm not done yet...": 2, "We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.": 2, "On your knees!": 2, "When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask.": 2, "Just step into the painting he said. Yeah, sure... like it's that simple.": 2, "Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.": 2, "What? Who... what do you want then?": 2, "Be more careful next time. This isn't a game. ": 2, "Lynly, would you mind taking care of the customer please?": 2, "Something is wrong. There is an intruder.": 2, "Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within.": 2, "Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.": 2, "Lurbuk?": 2, "Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this.": 2, "I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.": 2, "Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do.": 2, "What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!": 2, "I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm.": 2, "Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.": 2, "Come and see what is for sale, traveler.": 2, "Hm. I had not thought of it that way.": 2, "Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit.": 2, "Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!": 2, "What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - don't you? I won't let her have you!": 2, "Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.": 2, "I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside.": 2, "I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?": 2, "I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!": 2, "Be patient and your time will come.": 2, "Keep a sharp eye out.": 2, "I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.": 2, "Before the Blades wiped them all out.": 2, "Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor.": 2, "I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.": 2, "Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.": 2, "What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!": 2, "Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again.": 2, "You're not going to shoot, right?": 2, "What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!": 2, "Before the ancient flame...": 2, "Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.": 2, "Become one with the Evergloam!": 2, "Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job.": 2, "We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.": 2, "When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief.": 2, "When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt.": 2, "Just... just let me get my things and say goodbye to everyone. I'll meet you at home. Thanks! Thanks again!": 2, "When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon.": 2, "We must succeed here today.": 2, "*cough*": 2, "Be wary! The reavers have camps all over the island.": 2, "Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning.": 2, "I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!": 2, "We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.": 2, "We mustn't tarry... the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.": 2, "Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting.": 2, "Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others.": 2, "Maah!": 2, "I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess.": 2, "I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.": 2, "Collect the Rueful Axe from Rimerock Burrow, and I believe we'll have a deal.": 2, "When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping.": 2, "You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?": 2, "Close...": 2, "I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!": 2, "We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose.": 2, "You're still alive?": 2, "When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat.": 2, "Hmm. Feel a bit better now. Thanks.": 2, "When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall, my heart's desire.": 2, "I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!": 2, "Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!": 2, "When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work.": 2, "Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man.": 2, "Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that.": 2, "Sir!": 2, "When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil.": 2, "Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion.": 2, "When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through...": 2, "We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn.": 2, "Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.": 2, "When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far.": 2, "Just... die!": 2, "Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued.": 2, "I'm not looking for a conversation.": 2, "I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.": 2, "Before we wage war upon our foes, we must wage a war against our lesser selves. Cleave to your higher voice and with it shatter your foes.": 2, "Ma! You're home!": 2, "Because he himself bestowed upon you a portion of his vitality when he infused you with his own blood the night you returned with Serana.": 2, "I don't want to kill you, but I will.": 2, "When I find you, you're dead.": 2, "Once Kodlak began looking for his cure, I'd wager Skjor didn't bring it up again.": 2, "I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!": 2, "Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process.": 2, "I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.": 2, "I'm not going to warn you again.": 2, "We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow...": 2, "Help! Assassin!": 2, "A trick of the dark perhaps?": 2, "Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake.": 2, "Because war is good for business, of course.": 2, "When Brynjolf brought you before me I could feel a sudden shift in the wind.": 2, "Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.": 2, "Help! In here!": 2, "I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.": 2, "Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth.": 2, "Hmm hmm.": 2, "When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold.": 2, "Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth.": 2, "Ma took me to the market. We saw this huge fish! I bet even you couldn't lift it!": 2, "I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.": 2, "Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah.": 2, "We must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.": 2, "Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about.": 2, "We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that.": 2, "Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can convince him of the need.": 2, "We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss.": 2, "Hmm. I could be a great hunter like this.": 2, "Colorful...": 2, "When I grow up, I wanna join the Legion!": 2, "We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.": 2, "We need to bring it down!": 2, "Climb in back and we'll be off.": 2, "Climb down that ledge and see if you can...": 2, "Just... stay back.": 2, "Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination.": 2, "Ma! Look what followed me home!": 2, "When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way.": 2, "Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back.": 2, "I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.": 2, "Just what I was thinking.": 2, "Come back and see me if you ever need pickpocket training.": 2, "Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.": 2, "Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us.": 2, "Certainly. Be careful.": 2, "Keep under cover until it's down!": 2, "Keep up the effort, boy. Eyes on the horizon, always.": 2, "Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again.": 2, "Keep up the effort, young one. Eyes on the horizon, always.": 2, "We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.": 2, "When we are done with that, we will take our army to the Dominion, and show those pointy-eared bastards not every man is fit to be their slave.": 2, "Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.": 2, "What...? Whoever did this, you're dead. You hear me? Dead!": 2, "I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.": 2, "Certainly.": 2, "What... what am I going to do?": 2, "His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.": 2, "We stand out here in the cold, as brothers, warmed by the knowledge that we fight for the rights of every free citizen of the Empire.": 2, "Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.": 2, "Be careful out there... wouldn't want to lose such a promisin' cutpurse now, would we.": 2, "I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.": 2, "I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together...": 2, "We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming.": 2, "Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will begin to lose respect for you.": 2, "Keep to the shadows.": 2, "Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!": 2, "We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.": 2, "Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.": 2, "I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence.": 2, "Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy.": 2, "Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen.": 2, "I don't want a trail of dead bodies leading here. Keep it clean.": 2, "His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.": 2, "Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?": 2, "When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin.": 2, "We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.": 2, "What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?": 2, "I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.": 2, "We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.": 2, "What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?": 2, "Just remember the rules... keep it clean and keep it quiet. Here's the details.": 2, "Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way.": 2, "Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you.": 2, "Keep this up and you'll be rich enough retire before you know it. Good luck.": 2, "Keep to the shadows and you'll do fine.": 2, "Lots of lawless folk around here. Foreigners, mostly. No offense.": 2, "Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion.": 2, "Skyrim is a beautiful and harsh mistress, but her people cling to such a petty notion of honor.": 2, "Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.": 2, "Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.": 2, "I don't understand. Why can't we go home?": 2, "I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.": 2, "Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!": 2, "What's the situation?": 2, "Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought.": 2, "Best to keep clear.": 2, "We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways.": 2, "Silent means I don't tell and it's none of your business.": 2, "Best we all forget about her. Bad luck to talk about the dead in Markarth.": 2, "Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.": 2, "Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place.": 2, "Come back later and I may have some work for you.": 2, "What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?": 2, "We understand the Nightgate and Roughwater inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.": 2, "Betrid. No! We had a deal you Forsworn bastards!": 2, "Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.": 2, "Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors.": 2, "Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!": 2, "What's this now?": 2, "What's this?": 2, "Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again.": 2, "On the coldest of nights, in the steam rising from my breath, I see the many faces of the dead.": 2, "What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.": 2, "We still buy what we have to, but I make as much as I can.": 2, "Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so.": 2, "Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies will think twice after this victory.": 2, "Certainly, I'm ready.": 2, "What's your sign? I was born under the Steed, as luck would have it. Really ought to visit my doomstone somtime. It's fairly near here.": 2, "I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand.": 2, "Best leave the past buried, I say.": 2, "I'm listenin'.": 2, "Be careful out there.": 2, "Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.": 2, "I'll be right here. Be careful now!": 2, "We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?": 2, "Keep your eyes on it!": 2, "Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again.": 2, "Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door.": 2, "Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank...": 2, "Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.": 2, "Be careful out there. Solstheim is full of dangers.": 2, "I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much as we are from these dragon attacks.": 2, "Be careful!": 2, "Skyrim being sold to the Thalmor so the Emperor could keep his throne!": 2, "Come back as soon as you have the helm.": 2, "Be careful, there's no telling what lurks within these walls.": 2, "Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!": 2, "Begone, invader!": 2, "Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.": 2, "I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn.": 2, "What? That's not possible!": 2, "Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes.": 2, "I'm not asking, but if you happen to be the type, I hear that Kilkreath Ruin is a shrine to Merdia. You know. Daedra worship.": 2, "What? Something you're still confused about?": 2, "Keep it away from me!": 2, "Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me.": 2, "When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die.": 2, "We shall soon find out.": 2, "Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties.": 2, "Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it.": 2, "Someday I'll be Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.": 2, "Once we get inside, all will become clear.": 2, "When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die.": 2, "Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.": 2, "Keep firing!": 2, "We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to kill us!": 2, "We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted.": 2, "Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.": 2, "Lucky... hit...": 2, "We seem to have run out of Colovian brandy. I'll check in the wine cellar for more when I get a moment.": 2, "We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself.": 2, "Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.": 2, "Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse.": 2, "We meet at last, my dear lady.": 2, "I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority.": 2, "When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed.": 2, "You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?": 2, "Just sit back. This won't take long.": 2, "Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people.": 2, "Madness. It was madness to attack that coven of witches! Why didn't they listen to me?": 2, "I don't have time for this.": 2, "Just shut up and keep out of sight.": 2, "Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.": 2, "When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.": 2, "Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.": 2, "Be careful, lass. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.": 2, "Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.": 2, "Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.": 2, "Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship.": 2, "I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.": 2, "I don't do charity. No gold, no ride.": 2, "When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.": 2, "I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.": 2, "Keep quiet! We're hunting vampires spotted in the area.": 2, "We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.": 2, "What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city!": 2, "We should go get the axe.": 2, "Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.": 2, "I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own.": 2, "What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?": 2, "Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge.": 2, "Sky guard you.": 2, "We make quite a team, eh?": 2, "Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.": 2, "Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?": 2, "When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful. ": 2, "I'll be here when you're done.": 2, "I'll be here when you have more Stalhrim weapons and armor.": 2, "A problem? Let me see it.": 2, "We should get moving. There's no time to waste.": 2, "Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sorli the Builder assuming the Jarlship.": 2, "Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.": 2, "We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.": 2, "Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret.": 2, "Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it.": 2, "Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look. ": 2, "We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.": 2, "What? Now's not the time to chat.": 2, "What? Nooo!": 2, "Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet.": 2, "What? No. No don't kill me. Please!": 2, "I don't want that coming back to haunt me.": 2, "Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught.": 2, "Being friends with the bartender's son has its advantages, huh?": 2, "Her heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.": 2, "On the other hand, you've weeded out the weak from among those who would deign worship me.": 2, "Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.": 2, "Hjaalmarch would allow us to directly threaten the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...": 2, "Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.": 2, "What? Nightingales? But, I always assumed they were just a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line.": 2, "Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.": 2, "Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.": 2, "What do you suppose this is all about?": 2, "I'll enjoy killing you!": 2, "By the All-Maker!": 2, "So you can tell that heartless Daedra bitch I'm done doing her dirty work.": 2, "Let's have a closer look at these runes.": 2, "A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end.": 2, "But regrets are pointless. Here we are.": 2, "By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up.": 2, "Welcome to you.": 2, "Well, no... I... I mean...": 2, "I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there.": 2, "I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny...": 2, "Let's hope the miners didn't unearth anything besides precious stones, if you take my meaning.": 2, "Let's hope we both live through this day.": 2, "But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?": 2, "Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.": 2, "Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.": 2, "But someone keeps taking them down.": 2, "Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here.": 2, "I don't think I need to tell you why.": 2, "So you know what it's like to have your life in someone else's hands. Why should they get to decide? Isn't judgment for the gods?": 2, "I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.": 2, "I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!": 2, "So you may think.": 2, "I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway.": 2, "Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.": 2, "Here. Take my amulet as a reward.": 2, "Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us.": 2, "Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place.": 2, "Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!": 2, "By the Divines, I'm tired.": 2, "Let's get out of here.": 2, "Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago.": 2, "Let's get the axe and be done with this.": 2, "Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.": 2, "Well, spit it out. What's the matter?": 2, "I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.": 2, "Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?": 2, "Welcome to the Winking Skeever. Take a load off and enjoy the atmosphere.": 2, "Let's get to the stables before they find me.": 2, "Here? Right here? Very well, J'zargo shall wait.": 2, "Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you.": 2, "Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here.": 2, "I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question.": 2, "But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - \"Evgir Unslaad.\"": 2, "Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons.": 2, "But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.": 2, "Let's go tell the others.": 2, "Oh, um, Hi Papa!": 2, "I'm a man. Skyrim is man's homeland. That's a fact. A fact I'm proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history.": 2, "But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back.": 2, "Let's go!": 2, "I'm a mage, not a pawnbroker, you know.": 2, "Hermaeus Mora is laughing at us, you know.": 2, "Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.": 2, "Oh. Oh I see.": 2, "By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun.": 2, "You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so long...": 2, "Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you.": 2, "I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need.": 2, "Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again.": 2, "But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.": 2, "Let's make the bastards pay.": 2, "By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.": 2, "But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.": 2, "I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.": 2, "By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out.": 2, "But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within.": 2, "Well I don't know what that means. But we need to find out. She must either have something the vampires want, or be someone important to them.": 2, "I'll wait here.": 2, "Let's move out. Time's a wasting.": 2, "By all the gods...": 2, "I'll wait for you at the Jarl's Longhouse in Falkreath until you need me again, Thane.": 2, "So... now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?": 2, "By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers...": 2, "I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.": 2, "I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.": 2, "I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.": 2, "I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net.": 2, "I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it.": 2, "But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.": 2, "By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.": 2, "Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.": 2, "Look at them. The legendary sharpness of a deadric weapon. Marvelous.": 2, "A small price to pay for the betterment of our kind.": 2, "I'll make you pay for this, daughter!": 2, "Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold.": 2, "Let's just say a tiny part of you rubbed off on it, and in its place, a bit of the Soul Cairn filled the void.": 2, "Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.": 2, "But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim.": 2, "So you think you can make it on your own, then? We'll just see about that.": 2, "Look at the sky!": 2, "Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.": 2, "Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?": 2, "By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.": 2, "So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak.": 2, "By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor.": 2, "Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.": 2, "But that's your problem, not mine.": 2, "But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with.": 2, "But the Moot has not yet met to name her High Queen. And they won't. Not as long as I have any say in it.": 2, "Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead.": 2, "I'll meet you over there.": 2, "By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again.": 2, "Here. I'd like you to have this as a token my friendship.": 2, "I don't like it. What are they waiting for?": 2, "But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?": 2, "By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.": 2, "Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!": 2, "Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly.": 2, "Hey! I didn't ask you to magic me.": 2, "We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?": 2, "Let me take a look...": 2, "We've made you a fair offer. If you're really serious about this truce, you need to reconsider.": 2, "We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about.": 2, "We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.": 2, "But it's not even dark yet!": 2, "Look out, I think we have company.": 2, "So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong.": 2, "Hey! Don't get mad and hurt me again.": 2, "Hey! Don't do that.": 2, "Well, we can always use contributions.": 2, "Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders.": 2, "We've taken it before. I'm only asking for what will be ours soon enough anyway.": 2, "I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.": 2, "Look out! Gargoyles!": 2, "Your objective is Fort Sungard.": 2, "I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right.": 2, "Look out! Another Steam Centurion!": 2, "But learning a Word of Power is only the first step... you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout.": 2, "So we take matters into our own hands.": 2, "Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.": 2, "Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.": 2, "Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.": 2, "Let the darkness rip you asunder!": 2, "So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.": 2, "Well, well. Hello there, big man.": 2, "So this is how you defeated Alduin. Ruth... zu'u ni Alduin.": 2, "Well, what do you say, my brothers?": 2, "Well, what are you waiting for?!": 2, "Look! Here's another wall with dragon language inscriptions on it!": 2, "But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here.": 2, "Well, well... color me impressed, lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!": 2, "Well, well... color me impressed, lad. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!": 2, "Well, well. You've slain my followers. I should destroy you for your impudence!": 2, "Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?": 2, "Let me see... ah, yes. This is the Wheelstone. It's an heirloom symbol of the power of Windhelm. ": 2, "But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple.": 2, "So this is what it's like on the other side.": 2, "Well, well. Looks like one of the Dark Brotherhood rats escaped its burning nest. I can fix that.": 2, "Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?": 2, "Well, well. Look at you. Your kinsmen have turned you into an animal, Nord. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.": 2, "Well, well. Look at you. The Nords have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.": 2, "A smart man came and told us about a blade piece. ": 2, "I'll keep watch at Lakeview Manor until you return, Thane. Good hunting.": 2, "But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out.": 2, "You're right, you're right. I just... I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or... what?": 2, "Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty.": 2, "Your objective is Fort Snowhawk.": 2, "But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.": 2, "Look what I found! Here, take it!": 2, "Oh, this should be good.": 2, "Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances. ": 2, "So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?": 2, "But never mind all that. What brings you out this way?": 2, "Let's cut you loose.": 2, "Your objective is the enemy held fort.": 2, "Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course.": 2, "But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade.": 2, "Well, that's your business. Was there anything else you needed?": 2, "But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?": 2, "By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.": 2, "I'm afraid I had to pay off a few officials to keep you out of jail, boss. Expensive to get murder off the books, know what I mean?": 2, "Let's find out what's written here.": 2, "Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother.": 2, "Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister.": 2, "By the Eight... look at the sky!": 2, "But not all of them, because some of them are still here.": 2, "By the Eight...": 2, "Oh. Well. Good day.": 2, "Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.": 2, "Look at you! You're as filthy as a pig in a pen!": 2, "Your presence will be revealed.": 2, "But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin hunts me as we once hunted our prey - a bitter payment for many bloody deeds.": 2, "Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?": 2, "Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer.": 2, "But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert.": 2, "Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.": 2, "Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance.": 2, "Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.": 2, "Let's continue, we still have much to do.": 2, "Welcome back. I've left a few surprises for you to discover.": 2, "Welcome home.": 2, "You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?": 2, "Look how persistent you are. It's charming, really.": 2, "Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.": 2, "Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.": 2, "So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!": 2, "Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.": 2, "Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight.": 2, "But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.": 2, "So what do you think about it all, then?": 2, "Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like...": 2, "Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.": 2, "Well, then. Repeat after me.": 2, "Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places.": 2, "Well, then, I'm going to head back and get myself a drink. Maybe I'll see you soon.": 2, "Let's begin again.": 2, "Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.": 2, "Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.": 2, "Look deeply into the faces of the warriors around you. These are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim. See her strength and nobility in their eyes.": 2, "But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead.": 2, "I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin.": 2, "But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born.": 2, "But never mind all that. We've got a job to do.": 2, "Oh. Hi.": 2, "Well I...": 2, "Well, if I were a betting woman, I'd say it's a scraper of some sort.": 2, "But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!": 2, "I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.": 2, "So, perhaps you are not entirely useless... We shall soon find out.": 2, "Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own.": 2, "Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show.": 2, "I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.": 2, "By Her Benevolence, you shall not stop us!": 2, "So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself.": 2, "By Azura. The Gourmet!": 2, "Here, take these. Looks like you're running low.": 2, "Well met, hunter.": 2, "Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city.": 2, "Like... with the little girl.": 2, "Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.": 2, "Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!": 2, "Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!": 2, "But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.": 2, "So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you.": 2, "Well met, mage of Skyrim.": 2, "Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did.": 2, "Well, I guess that's good enough... let's be off...": 2, "I don't need you to teach me how to play high politics in Skyrim.": 2, "So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked.": 2, "So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.": 2, "Well, I guess Margret isn't around to complain. It's yours.": 2, "Well met again, Hunter.": 2, "So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?": 2, "But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!": 2, "But which among you truly exceeds the rest?": 2, "Well hello.": 2, "I'll stay here. You try not to get into too much trouble.": 2, "Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.": 2, "Oh, we'll make sure it's emptied out by morning. You can trust us!": 2, "I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.": 2, "Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason.": 2, "I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news. ": 2, "I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.": 2, "But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle.": 2, "Here, take this gift as a sign of the Empire's appreciation, and my own.": 2, "Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out.": 2, "I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.": 2, "So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that.": 2, "Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.": 2, "By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist.": 2, "So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace.": 2, "Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.": 2, "So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome.": 2, "Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.": 2, "So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?": 2, "So, name your poison! Ha ha ha. Oh, I never get tired of that one!": 2, "I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done.": 2, "So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?": 2, "I don't see why someone would actually use them.": 2, "I'll send you to Oblivion!": 2, "I'll see you back in Riverwood.": 2, "Well said! You may be fighting on the wrong side in this war.": 2, "But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?": 2, "But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold.": 2, "But, give me... just a moment... I must gather a few things...": 2, "I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the good of the village. So... thank you.": 2, "But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to \"persuade\" him to aid our cause, indirectly of course.": 2, "Oh, yes please!": 2, "Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.": 2, "But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting.": 2, "But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do. Don't we?": 2, "But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?": 2, "So, what can I do for ya today?": 2, "Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?": 2, "Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath.": 2, "Listen. All of you!": 2, "I'll scatter your ashes myself!": 2, "Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.": 2, "Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.": 2, "Oh, wow! Are you... are you sure? You really wouldn't mind?": 2, "But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College.": 2, "So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?": 2, "I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill.": 2, "But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother.": 2, "Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde.": 2, "So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut.": 2, "I'll return to Windstad Manor and remain on guard, my Thane.": 2, "Here's your share of their reward.": 2, "Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned.": 2, "So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.": 2, "Here's your share. Well done.": 2, "Your Thu'um is no match for mine.": 2, "So, you use my own Shout against me. You learn quickly.": 2, "Oh, well. You know. A bit of this, a bit of that.": 2, "Well now, this is unexpected...": 2, "But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this. ": 2, "Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.": 2, "Oh, yes, right, of course!": 2, "But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.": 2, "But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.": 2, "But... you're right. There's nothing to be gained by refusing the Greybeards' request.": 2, "I'll see you soon.": 2, "Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.": 2, "But, I need that money! I earned it.": 2, "Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.": 2, "So, you in for a little fishin'?": 2, "Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled.": 2, "Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better.": 2, "I'll return to Highmoon Hall in Morthal until you need me again, Thane.": 2, "But... we could use the breathing space to regroup.": 2, "Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.": 2, "Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?": 2, "Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin.": 2, "Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that.": 2, "So, Dragonborn. What do you say?": 2, "So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.": 2, "Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one.": 2, "Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!": 2, "I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.": 2, "But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud.": 2, "Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.": 2, "Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though.": 2, "By Ysmir, a thief!": 2, "But those days are behind us, now.": 2, "Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.": 2, "But those gold-grubbers at the East Empire Company started charging more than their share for bringing it over.": 2, "So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.": 2, "Let's see where this goes.": 2, "So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh?": 2, "But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.": 2, "Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish.": 2, "Let's see. From a Loredas of Last Seed until a Middas of Heartfire... it will happen soon. Very soon.": 2, "But tomorrow. Definitely.": 2, "Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then.": 2, "But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait.": 2, "Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.": 2, "Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here.": 2, "Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.": 2, "Here, this is for you.": 2, "So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?": 2, "I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.": 2, "So you're the one that burned down Goldenglow Estate.": 2, "Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?": 2, "Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!": 2, "Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that.": 2, "By a bold stroke, you bested me, friend.": 2, "I don't like the look of this place.": 2, "Well all right, then.": 2, "Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.": 2, "I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.": 2, "Oh. All right... I guess I'll just keep practicing on my own. Sorry to bother you.": 2, "Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks.": 2, "Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful.": 2, "But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back.": 2, "A small measure of his blood now and forever flows through your veins.": 2, "Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts.": 2, "By Ysmir, you won't leave here alive!": 2, "Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.": 2, "I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle...": 2, "Well, for the thrill of course.": 2, "I'll need this... No, no, useless trash... where'd I put my annotated Anuad?": 2, "But they don't say how he does this.": 2, "Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins.": 2, "But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.": 2, "Let's see if we can find a way out of here.": 2, "I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere.": 2, "Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up.": 2, "Look at all the snow! I want to go sledding! Or skating!": 2, "Here's your gold, as promised.": 2, "Well, I... Don't you see?": 2, "Let's try not to make too much noise. I've heard that cave-ins can start that way.": 2, "So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me.": 2, "Here, take your gold and leave me in peace.": 2, "Lets see how tough you are without Sam keeping an eye on you.": 2, "I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.": 2, "Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.": 2, "Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely.": 2, "I'll take this one back to the castle.": 2, "Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor. ": 2, "Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have.": 2, "Here's your gold.": 2, "Well enough. Riften's a tough city, but... it's a tough world. Kid has to learn to stand up for themselves sometime.": 2, "Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.": 2, "Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart.": 2, "But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?": 2, "where welcome, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join that fellowship of honor.": 2, "Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership.": 2, "Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.": 2, "Well fought, friend. Your fury is unmatched.": 2, "Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me.": 2, "So, he wants to take my city, walls intact.": 2, "Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat.": 2, "Well done. You have now passed all the trials.": 2, "By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for.": 2, "Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts.": 2, "I'll never speak to you again!": 2, "Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it.": 2, "I'll never submit!": 2, "So, are you working with them? You think you can take me? You so much as touch me, and you're going to lose fingers.": 2, "Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.": 2, "Well, aren't you the pretty one. I bet all the men chase after you.": 2, "Well, aren't you the handsome one. You and I should spend some time together.": 2, "By Ysmir! Nothing kills it!": 2, "So, can I interest you in anything today?": 2, "Well done.": 2, "Well done. Again.": 2, "Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus.": 2, "Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return.": 2, "So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?": 2, "I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful.": 2, "Let's talk for moment.": 2, "Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice.": 2, "By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!": 2, "Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?": 2, "I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet.": 2, "Well done. I wasn't certain you'd even know what to look for.": 2, "So, did you still need my assistance?": 2, "By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?": 2, "So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?": 2, "Oh, wait... it gets much better.": 2, "Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.": 2, "Well, what is it you want?": 2, "You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.": 2, "What could drive a man to do something like this?": 2, "What could be worth studying about a long-lost civilization?": 2, "But I at least will negotiate in good faith.": 2, "Your Thu'um is strong, Dovahkiin. But not strong enough!": 2, "I'm glad we agree on this.": 2, "We're mounting our final attack on Windhelm. You're needed on the front line. Get a move on soldier!": 2, "But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.": 2, "We're not done here.": 2, "But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.": 2, "But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?": 2, "What can I get for you, sir?": 2, "What can I get for you, ma'am?": 2, "We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!": 2, "Hey, over here!": 2, "Some other time, perhaps.": 2, "I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember.": 2, "What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?": 2, "Look, if you just want to sit around the Flagon all day getting drunk, that's your business. Just quit wasting my time.": 2, "Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?": 2, "Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful.": 2, "What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?": 2, "Your objective is Fort Dunstad.": 2, "Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.": 2, "I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.": 2, "I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.": 2, "Last mistake.": 2, "What day is it? What year? What era even?": 2, "Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with.": 2, "I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.": 2, "Here you are.": 2, "We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called \"The Dreamstride.\"": 2, "We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.": 2, "What did you need?": 2, "We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us.": 2, "I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?": 2, "Business is absolutely booming, my friend.": 2, "I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.": 2, "We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help. ": 2, "Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.": 2, "I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.": 2, "I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border.": 2, "What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!": 2, "We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?": 2, "But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.": 2, "What did ya do that for?": 2, "I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.": 2, "Look, it's all very simple.": 2, "But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith.": 2, "But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.": 2, "I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.": 2, "Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.": 2, "You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!": 2, "So he has talked! I knew it!": 2, "What brings you here?": 2, "Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?": 2, "What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?": 2, "What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?": 2, "Lead on, Thane.": 2, "We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's cousin is getting married! ": 2, "You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.": 2, "I'm getting out of here!": 2, "We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's visiting! The goddamned Emperor!": 2, "A risky game to play, friend.": 2, "Here you go, ma'am. The finest Colovian brandy.": 2, "We're right behind you.": 2, "Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?": 2, "What are you doing, s'wit?": 2, "What are you doing that for?": 2, "Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?": 2, "What are you doing in here?": 2, "What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.": 2, "Lead on, we're ready.": 2, "So it falls to me to be the one to give up the secrets to our ancient enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him.": 2, "Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead. ": 2, "What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind.": 2, "Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here.": 2, "But I need your help. We need your help.": 2, "I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.": 2, "Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.": 2, "You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of your kinsmen stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.": 2, "But I don't want to!": 2, "Can anyone hear me? I am a prisoner of the Thalmor. help!": 2, "Last warning. Leave, now.": 2, "A stirring in the dark?": 2, "You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the Nord stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.": 2, "I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere.": 2, "Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad.": 2, "Hey, let's talk a second.": 2, "Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?": 2, "I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously.": 2, "I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail.": 2, "Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.": 2, "What are you waiting for?": 2, "So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands.": 2, "I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.": 2, "What are you talking about?": 2, "We're off to a good start.": 2, "We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you.": 2, "Here you go, boss. All the details.": 2, "But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!": 2, "I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it.": 2, "I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.": 2, "What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.": 2, "We're passing Fort Sungard. Unbelievable view from up there. No wonder the Empire built a fort on that hill way back when.": 2, "Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there.": 2, "Can I help you with anything else?": 2, "I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him.": 2, "Lars is such a milk-drinker. He can't even stand up to a girl.": 2, "Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble.": 2, "I'm going to make you sorry for this!": 2, "Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always.": 2, "What exactly did this amulet look like?": 2, "We're gathering for our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in Haafingar.": 2, "We're gathering for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.": 2, "I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.": 2, "I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me.": 2, "Okay, what'll it be?": 2, "What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-": 2, "Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you.": 2, "Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary.": 2, "Hey, where do you think you're going? We have work to do.": 2, "What does it take to kill this monster?": 2, "Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.": 2, "Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.": 2, "We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.": 2, "What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.": 2, "What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.": 2, "Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves.": 2, "Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?": 2, "I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway.": 2, "Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold.": 2, "What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more.": 2, "Can you not hear me? Are your ears full of hate? ": 2, "Bring whatever he's carrying to me, and I'll send you with convincing misinformation back to Dawnstar.": 2, "We're fighting because we're done bleeding for an Empire that won't bleed for us.": 2, "Somebody get that idiot some armor...": 2, "So about this axe... ": 2, "Can't fail now... must hang on...": 2, "We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.": 2, "Somebody get that fool a blanket.": 2, "We're attacking Riften. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!": 2, "Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you.": 2, "Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.": 2, "Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine.": 2, "Okay. I'll get this inside the Embassy for you. I've got to go. I'll find you at the party, don't worry.": 2, "We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.": 2, "Bring me whatever he's carrying, and I'll send you to Morthal with something convincing but full of lies.": 2, "So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them.": 2, "So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good above our own interests.": 2, "So be it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the greater good above our own interests.": 2, "Some take to it more than others.": 2, "Can't a man drink in peace?": 2, "So be it. We gave you a choice.": 2, "Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then.": 2, "I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.": 2, "We're fighting because Skyrim needs heroes, and there's no one else but us.": 2, "We're fighting because our own Jarls, once strong, wise men, have become fearful and blind to their people's suffering.": 2, "I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did.": 2, "Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward, that's your problem.": 2, "Burn the king!": 2, "Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?": 2, "I'm going to find you...": 2, "Lady Mara... preserve me...": 2, "Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions.": 2, "So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.": 2, "What do you need, stranger?": 2, "You're nothing!": 2, "I'm goin' to tell you'll somethin' you'll never hear me say again, and if you tell anyone I told you, I'll deny it.": 2, "Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here.": 2, "We're going to take out their sentry, then sneak into their camp and ambush them.": 2, "I'm glad you're on our side.": 2, "I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am.": 2, "Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said \"after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.\"": 2, "What do you mean? Why were the vampires after this woman?": 2, "I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.": 2, "What do you mean?": 2, "I don't think that could have gone any better.": 2, "I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders.": 2, "I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.": 2, "Land? Ah, yes. The Heljarchen estate. I thought of you immediately when it became available.": 2, "I'll follow your lead.": 2, "Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...": 2, "Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.": 2, "Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.": 2, "Here we go...": 2, "What do you say? Can you do this?": 2, "Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning us on to welcome long sought?": 2, "Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you? ": 2, "Lady Mara... I await your embrace...": 2, "Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire.": 2, "What do you want, lizard?": 2, "What do you want, little elf?": 2, "Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?": 2, "What do you want, cat?": 2, "Here we go!": 2, "What do you want, Imperial?": 2, "What do you want to play?": 2, "We're going to make them pay.": 2, "What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?": 2, "So endeth the lesson.": 2, "I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?": 2, "We're going to slaughter them. All of them.": 2, "What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start.": 2, "What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start?": 2, "Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.": 2, "Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.": 2, "Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?": 2, "Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away.": 2, "Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up.": 2, "Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.": 2, "What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?": 2, "I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.": 2, "So, what's the plan?": 2, "But I never knew if nights-end brought victory - a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.": 2, "But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.": 2, "What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to.": 2, "We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.": 2, "A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.": 2, "We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years.": 2, "Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.": 2, "We've got a murderer on the loose...": 2, "Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set.": 2, "I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.": 2, "Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him.": 2, "Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables.": 2, "Let me do the talking.": 2, "Your objective is Fort Greymoor.": 2, "We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.": 2, "But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead.": 2, "Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.": 2, "Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules.": 2, "By what right do you request entry?": 2, "Hey! Where did I go? I can't see myself!": 2, "Well. You surprise me. I was expecting you to favor Ulfric. Maybe this council will achieve something after all.": 2, "I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?": 2, "Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see...": 2, "So that's my sad story. What do you think?": 2, "So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?": 2, "But first, you must restore to me my beacon.": 2, "A soul gem... that's what it was. Then... I must be... Oh, no.": 2, "Look, I got the message. What else did you want?": 2, "Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces.": 2, "Bye, Mama!": 2, "Hey, I still have plenty of work to do here.": 2, "Bye, now.": 2, "Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?": 2, "But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you.": 2, "We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?": 2, "You're outmatched!": 2, "Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you.": 2, "Hey, I got you something. Hope you like it!": 2, "Look, I told the client you probably had a good reason to kill the mark, but well, they demanded reparations.": 2, "Well... yes. I mean, all of the gold didn't come from me. I have a silent partner that helped with the finances.": 2, "We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions.": 2, "Bye, Papa!": 2, "Bye, Pa!": 2, "Less talk, more hunt.": 2, "Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about.": 2, "Well... we could use some breathing space to regroup. Things haven't been going well for us lately.": 2, "We've failed. The city is lost. They're through the gates and will be here soon.": 2, "Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.": 2, "Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.": 2, "But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.": 2, "But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.": 2, "But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm.": 2, "Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?": 2, "Bye, Ma!": 2, "Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!": 2, "Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.": 2, "Your objective is Fort Kastav.": 2, "Let me know when you're ready.": 2, "We've got to get out of here.": 2, "So there's nothing more to be said.": 2, "But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything.": 2, "Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.": 2, "But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces.": 2, "Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence.": 2, "I don't know, but he sounded impatient.": 2, "Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade.": 2, "Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really.": 2, "I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.": 2, "But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding.": 2, "Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.": 2, "I'm afraid you'll have to come back later. I've been given strict instructions that no one be allowed to trouble Lady Elisif.": 2, "Let me out. They're going to kill me!": 2, "Here's everythin' you need. You get caught, and we've never heard of you.": 2, "So they don't like us either. ": 2, "Let me put the pieces on the altar. We'll see if Mehrunes Dagon can still be reached.": 2, "But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life.": 2, "But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.": 2, "A sad time.": 2, "Your objective is Fort Neugrad.": 2, "You're right. Let Tullius be the one to insult the Greybeards by refusing their summons.": 2, "Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves.": 2, "By the way, if you're looking for something to do...": 2, "Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it.": 2, "Hey! Wanna play tag?": 2, "Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here.": 2, "Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards.": 2, "So that's why you were in the cart. Thieving.": 2, "Look, I don't like wasting my time. Come back when you decide to get serious.": 2, "Well. Good! You favor the Empire less than I feared. Maybe we will be able to come to some agreement here after all.": 2, "So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?": 2, "I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.": 2, "So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone.": 2, "I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, \"find\" and I'll see what I can do.": 2, "So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming?": 2, "Well, you've certainly proven your worth around here to me. Please, accept this gift as a token of my appreciation!": 2, "Hey! What did you do to me? My body is gone!": 2, "By the nine!": 2, "Oh?": 2, "Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here.": 2, "I'll just be tending the museum if you need me.": 2, "But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.": 2, "Well, you seem like the honest sort. Here you are.": 2, "Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.": 2, "But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.": 2, "But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him \"the Unliving.\" I wouldn't approach him directly.": 2, "Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll... I'll pay next month.": 2, "By the gods... I've never seen anything like it... I, uh... I don't think this will go in my book.": 2, "Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work.": 2, "Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.": 2, "I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later.": 2, "I'm busy right now, lass. We can talk later.": 2, "Leave me alone, Braith...": 2, "Hey, be careful!": 2, "But I'm disappointed to hear you ran away from the battle. The gods do not reward cowardice. Nor do I. I expect better from you.": 2, "What a relief. Master Neloth surely would have punished me had he found out.": 2, "What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.": 2, "What a horrible place.": 2, "So long \"friend.\" Ha ha ha!": 2, "I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.": 2, "I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.": 2, "I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see.": 2, "Look, Papa! I made a new friend!": 2, "What a delightful find! This should cover it.": 2, "Look, Mama! I have a new friend!": 2, "We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better.": 2, "Hey, Talen... get off your lazy tail and take care of the customer!": 2, "I'm eager to try.": 2, "We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.": 2, "You're right. We're not alone.": 2, "Here you go, miss. Colovian brandy.": 2, "Leave me be.": 2, "I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight.": 2, "So many say that, at first, until they realize the truth.": 2, "Here you go, sir. Colovian brandy.": 2, "I join you in death, father...": 2, "Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.": 2, "We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!": 2, "So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.": 2, "Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path.": 2, "Hey, good to see you!": 2, "What am I doing here? I don't belong in a place like this!": 2, "Hey, get out of here!": 2, "But I still hear the call of the blood.": 2, "But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.": 2, "But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.": 2, "We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?": 2, "What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding.": 2, "I don't know who in Windhelm would even have something like that. Other than me, of course. ": 2, "Look, before I have you help track Mercer down I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything.": 2, "Okay! You stand right there and count to 10... no peeking! Ready? ...Go!": 2, "Can I give you a little tip? Take every job you can get or else you'll end up a beggar.": 2, "But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young.": 2, "We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.": 2, "Can I get you something?": 2, "What about him?": 2, "Leave - me - a - lone!": 2, "But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.": 2, "We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.": 2, "We're taking Dawnstar. Get down there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!": 2, "Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.": 2, "We're taking Winterhold. Get over there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!": 2, "We're taking the capital. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!": 2, "Hey, Pa, I got you something! I hope you like it!": 2, "Hey, Pa! Welcome back!": 2, "Wha? But.... but it's dark out. Is it... really okay?": 2, "We've almost got it!": 2, "Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.": 2, "Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.": 2, "I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here.": 2, "Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake.": 2, "I'm calling it \"Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue.\" It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings.": 2, "Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!": 2, "Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important.": 2, "I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?": 2, "Call... that... a... swing?": 2, "Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do.": 2, "Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is... astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself...": 2, "I'm busy, is this important?": 2, "I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.": 2, "Here you go. This should cover it.": 2, "Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do.": 2, "Some layabout named Sabjorn.": 2, "Well? Out with it.": 2, "Legate. We represent the Emperor here.": 2, "Here you go. Your continued assistance to the cause is appreciated.": 2, "Hey, I want to talk to you... now.": 2, "Your objective is Fort Greenwall.": 2, "You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.": 2, "Well? You done or what?": 2, "But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If not you, then someone else. ": 2, "...I can't believe this...": 2, "You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.": 2, "Here you go, sir. The finest Colovian brandy.": 2, "Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people.": 2, "Wha... seriously? No way... With this, I... I could buy everything in the market! Wow! Thanks!": 2, "But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...": 2, "Hey, Pa!": 2, "But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this.": 2, "Leave that to me.": 2, "I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.": 2, "But Shor restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep-counselled, your doom he foresaw.": 2, "I'm cutting your pay for this job.": 2, "Hey, Ma! Welcome back!": 2, "A bit much, going around like that...": 2, "But Ulfric and his \"Stormcloaks\" are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire.": 2, "Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds.": 2, "Were you certain in your purpose, you would have no need to apologize.": 2, "Leave us now.": 2, "We're with you.": 2, "We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?": 2, "I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.": 2, "We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.": 2, "Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do.": 2, "But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!": 2, "Leave, outlander.": 2, "I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.": 2, "I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.": 2, "But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.": 2, "Good. Make it it happen, soldier.": 2, "Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?": 2, "I can't believe we're the only ones who survived.": 2, "All set, let's go.": 2, "All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.": 2, "All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.": 2, "People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.": 2, "I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long.": 2, "All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum.": 2, "People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.": 2, "Is that? Did you repair the blade? ": 2, "If it will help you, then certainly.": 2, "I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!": 2, "If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!": 2, "All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed.": 2, "Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?": 2, "Really? Are you... are you sure?": 2, "Really? Do you... do you have a place I could live?": 2, "All this just to kill me Clavicus?": 2, "Is there no end to this nightmare?": 2, "I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.": 2, "You little wretch, I saw that!": 2, "You little thief!": 2, "Really? Great! Okay. So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the \"right\" way to do things.": 2, "All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.": 2, "All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.": 2, "I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!": 2, "You liar!": 2, "Is there still something you need of me?": 2, "You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was \"after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.\"": 2, "You leave me no choice!": 2, "I can't believe we're finally getting out.": 2, "You learn quickly. Once more.": 2, "All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you. Good luck!": 2, "I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims.": 2, "Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?": 2, "You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times.": 2, "All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.": 2, "'Jiit caravan brought this shop a nice piece from Elsweyr. Think you can break into their strongbox and get it for us?": 2, "You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?": 2, "You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.": 2, "Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?": 2, "You may strike me down, but your doom is near.": 2, "You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents.": 2, "Ready to do this?": 2, "Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?": 2, "You may have heard of him. He's a famous Telvanni wizard.": 2, "Ready to get moving?": 2, "You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.": 2, "All right. I'll tell you a little story.": 2, "You may even be my champion. Perhaps. ": 2, "I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad.": 2, "Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I will reconsider.": 2, "Ready to go?": 2, "All right. Take this and get out of here.": 2, "I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!": 2, "All right. Thanks.": 2, "All right. That should do it. I think I'm ready to try the College again. Thanks!": 2, "You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.": 2, "You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well.": 2, "Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek.": 2, "You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised.": 2, "You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way.": 2, "You lost the trust of the people of Skyrim, Elisif. You had your chance to make the right choice when the war started.": 2, "All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge. Good luck!": 2, "I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.": 2, "You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can.": 2, "Is there... something else you need?": 2, "Really? Where?": 2, "You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.": 2, "You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.": 2, "You know the rules. Just answer the questions.": 2, "You know the rules.": 2, "You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.": 2, "You know that our supply is limited. It could be a season or more before we get a new shipment from the south.": 2, "Peace may yet return to Skyrim. But until then, we fight.": 2, "If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex.": 2, "You know exactly... no. Not this time.": 2, "Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.": 2, "It all ends here, assassin!": 2, "If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric.": 2, "Alright, get the crown off that draugr!": 2, "Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin.": 2, "If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.": 2, "You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.": 2, "Aaah!": 2, "It appears I have you to thank for turning my daughter against me.": 2, "It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months.": 2, "Peace and bountiful harvests to you.": 2, "It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.": 2, "You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.": 2, "Reasons? Since when does a man need a reason to protect his family, to defend his homeland?": 2, "Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar.": 2, "Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.": 2, "Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!": 2, "Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once.": 2, "Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals.": 2, "If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.": 2, "You learn a new word like a master... you truly do have the gift.": 2, "You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?": 2, "You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.": 2, "Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?": 2, "If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.": 2, "If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that.": 2, "People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday.": 2, "Is this your best effort? Again.": 2, "You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake.": 2, "All-Maker keep you safe.": 2, "Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now.": 2, "All-Maker save us!": 2, "Really? J'zargo was having such fun. Ah, well. Back to the College then.": 2, "If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.": 2, "All-Maker, give me strength!": 2, "Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?": 2, "You know, I'm almost beginning to like you, but you haven't earned your place out of here yet.": 2, "You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least.": 2, "All-Maker... please...": 2, "All-righty. Good luck out there, boss.": 2, "(Crying)": 2, "Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position.": 2, "Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins.": 2, "If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace.": 2, "I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.": 2, "Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How... uninspired.": 2, "Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters.": 2, "If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.": 2, "Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?": 2, "Huzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod, Aahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!": 2, "If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.": 2, "Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting.": 2, "You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash.": 2, "Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.": 2, "Is that confidence I hear... or is it arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.": 2, "You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can lay their hands on?": 2, "I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.": 2, "All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.": 2, "You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.": 2, "If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it.": 2, "If that's all, there's pressing concerns that need dealing with.": 2, "Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side...": 2, "Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo.": 2, "Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress.": 2, "You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover your mistake.": 2, "Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.": 2, "I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.": 2, "You need to start pulling your own weight around here, otherwise I might \"forget\" to offer you any more jobs.": 2, "If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it.": 2, "You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.": 2, "All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say that my father couldn't stand the place. Too... peaceful.": 2, "Is everyone here? Let's get this started.": 2, "Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid.": 2, "If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away.": 2, "If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir.": 2, "All right men. On me! For the Emperor! For his Legionnaires!": 2, "You need to bloody well get your priorities straight if you want to make it around here.": 2, "Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue.": 2, "All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.": 2, "You need something, pa?": 2, "You need something, ma?": 2, "Perhaps it was nothing...": 2, "You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.": 2, "All right, I'll entertain you a bit more. Go on.": 2, "Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it.": 2, "I can't believe Silus is collecting Mythic Dawn artifacts. Right here in Dawnstar, no less.": 2, "I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?": 2, "I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers.": 2, "Intruder! Help!": 2, "You really don't know?": 2, "All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.": 2, "I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor.": 2, "You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you.": 2, "Quickly, come with me.": 2, "If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.": 2, "You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you.": 2, "Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened.": 2, "You ready to pay the toll? One shiv.": 2, "You ready to go yet?": 2, "I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!": 2, "If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance.": 2, "You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?": 2, "Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.": 2, "Interest you in some marksman training?": 2, "Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.": 2, "Quickly, we have no time to lose.": 2, "All I said to Potema was I thought she looked a little portly in that gown. How was I supposed to know?": 2, "If the All-Maker favors us, we will eat well for many days.": 2, "If that's what you want. Watch your back out there, and if you need me again, you know where I'll be.": 2, "Zu'u nis krif tol. It cannot be done.": 2, "Interesting. Same dragon...": 2, "All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger.": 2, "All aboard!": 2, "You picked quite a day for a trip to Solitude.": 2, "You picked quite a day for a trip to Markarth.": 2, "Quickly, what is it?": 2, "All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.": 2, "Into the tunnel. Let's go.": 2, "Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.": 2, "All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?": 2, "You need an escort at all times.": 2, "If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials.": 2, "You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister.": 2, "You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother.": 2, "You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.": 2, "You must be new. We don't talk to each other here.": 2, "I can't believe that worked.": 2, "All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you. ": 2, "You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.": 2, "Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...": 2, "I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that.": 2, "You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.": 2, "All right, then. We'll get together later.": 2, "You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe.": 2, "You're home!": 2, "All right, whatever you want.": 2, "I can't believe this is happening, lad.": 2, "I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.": 2, "Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.": 2, "You might be able to trap him there, exactly.": 2, "I almost died in a ruin just like this.": 2, "I can't believe this is happening, lass.": 2, "I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.": 2, "Is that all you've got?": 2, "You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.": 2, "I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.": 2, "You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal.": 2, "You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!": 2, "All right. Don't be long.": 2, "All right. Don't take too long.": 2, "All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!": 2, "You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.": 2, "You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.": 2, "Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.": 2, "If only I could, Listener.": 2, "I can't believe it's come to this.": 2, "If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.": 2, "I can't believe it's over. Twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done.": 2, "Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph.": 2, "If royal blood was spilt, all of Cyrodiil would be up in arms. We can't afford an all out war with the Empire. So we'll bide our time for now.": 2, "Raaarrgh!": 2, "You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice.": 2, "If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess.": 2, "All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober.": 2, "All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?": 2, "All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you.": 2, "You must leave immediately.": 2, "All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me.": 2, "Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.": 2, "You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.": 2, "You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.": 2, "You must have been away from your kind for a long time to forget. Come, speak to the chief and the wise woman and remember.": 2, "Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?": 2, "I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?": 2, "All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.": 2, "Is it really you? I can't believe it!": 2, "All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand.": 2, "I can't believe it. You have them already?": 2, "Is it safe now?": 2, "Is it safe?": 2, "You must feel the Word within yourself.": 2, "I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly.": 2, "I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.": 2, "I can't believe it...": 2, "You must bring her to us.": 2, "You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?": 2, "Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.": 2, "(Gasps)": 2, "And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.": 2, "And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.": 2, "You fought well. I find you worthy.": 2, "It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim.": 2, "You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?": 2, "And among those, it seems, only when the heavens show the correct aspects.": 2, "It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion.": 2, "Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.": 2, "You fight valiantly against fate, but I am stronger here.": 2, "I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.": 2, "And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!": 2, "And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!": 2, "Rest well and sleep deeply, my brother.": 2, "And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?": 2, "And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade.": 2, "I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful.": 2, "You ever met one of them cats? - kah-jeet, I think they call themselves. I hear there's whole countries full of them down south.": 2, "Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny.": 2, "You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?": 2, "And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills.": 2, "Retribution was swift. I was captured, quickly tried, and sentenced to death. But my execution never came.": 2, "Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav.": 2, "You're letting me go? What's wrong, is my skill with a blade making you look bad? Hah! I'm kidding, friend. Until we meet again!": 2, "You drew blood, so you aren't getting paid. That's the rules. You don't like it, take it up with Brynjolf.": 2, "Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way. ": 2, "You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds...": 2, "You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.": 2, "Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.": 2, "And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.": 2, "And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver.": 2, "You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric?": 2, "You found what?": 2, "You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect.": 2, "And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm. ": 2, "Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead.": 2, "You got me a present? Wow, thanks, Pa!": 2, "You got me a present? Wow, thanks, Ma!": 2, "You got me a present? Really?": 2, "Papa!": 2, "Papa told you to do that, not me! Now leave me alone!": 2, "And I was so close to being rid of you.": 2, "Remember. It was the Nords who locked you up.": 2, "And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.": 2, "And I would deserve it, wouldn't I?": 2, "And I wouldn't very well tell you about the cuts if I had made them, now would I?": 2, "Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.": 2, "I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.": 2, "Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here.": 2, "You go report our success. I'll set up a garrison here. A shame none of the prisoners made it, but their names will be remembered.": 2, "Papa said we could go fishing! With my help, I'm sure he'll catch something this time!": 2, "And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way.": 2, "I... won't... surrender!": 2, "And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.": 2, "And I... I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key.": 2, "It is the greatest token we can bestow upon those we love and wish to see protected.": 2, "I... uh... you'll be missed, old man.": 2, "You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.": 2, "You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.": 2, "You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace.": 2, "You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.": 2, "I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.": 2, "I... shouldn't say that.": 2, "It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace.": 2, "It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.": 2, "And don't think I've forgotten that you were the one that gave it to Ulfric in the first place.": 2, "And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.": 2, "I can't thank you enough for setting me up as steward of Tel Mithryn.": 2, "Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?": 2, "You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels.": 2, "You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric.": 2, "You dirty, filching lizard!": 2, "You dirty thief!": 2, "And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire.": 2, "You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.": 2, "I... I know it's not much, but... I've found a few pretty things. They're in the chest in my room.": 2, "And if I were you I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.": 2, "I... I know it's not much, but... I've found a few little things. I've put them in the chest in my room.": 2, "Pa said he'd take me hunting soon. I can't wait! I bet I'll bring down a mammoth!": 2, "I... I have a home again. A family. I almost can't believe it.": 2, "You didn't have to help me, so... thanks.": 2, "And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire.": 2, "Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.": 2, "And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them.": 2, "I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.": 2, "However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands.": 2, "You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account.": 2, "You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!": 2, "You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.": 2, "You did the best you could, sister. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.": 2, "You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.": 2, "You did the best you could, Dragonborn. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.": 2, "You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more.": 2, "You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.": 2, "However, I'm disappointed to hear that you fled from the field of battle. We do not reward cowardice in the Legion. I expect better of you.": 2, "It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!": 2, "Pa! Look what followed me home!": 2, "And don't think for a moment I've forgotten it was you that lost us the hold in the first place.": 2, "Pa! You're home!": 2, "And here's your payment for the shards.": 2, "And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. ": 2, "I can't talk now.": 2, "Return to me when your part is done.": 2, "However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed.": 2, "Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light.": 2, "Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget your sacrifice.": 2, "Paaz Keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot, Dovahkiin kos fin saviik do muz!": 2, "And for ourselves...": 2, "Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.": 2, "And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child. ": 2, "It makes me sad whenever I think about it.": 2, "Return with the gauntlets, or not at all.": 2, "And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.": 2, "And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend.": 2, "I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.": 2, "It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.": 2, "However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him.": 2, "It matters not. The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun. As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world.": 2, "Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us?": 2, "And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.": 2, "And here I thought you were a master criminal. Guess I was wrong.": 2, "And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!": 2, "I... I'll be all right. Please, just... just make it stop!": 2, "I... I will. Thank you...": 2, "I... I understand. That's not an existence I would wish on anyone.": 2, "And here you are. Good. Come in, browse the display, and let's talk. I have a job you look perfect for.": 2, "And here you are. I hope you've found the museum to your liking.": 2, "Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk.": 2, "And here's the spoils. Plenty more where this came from!": 2, "And his name is...?": 2, "If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him. ": 2, "And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make the arrangements.": 2, "You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.": 2, "It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.": 2, "You have your orders. Get moving.": 2, "It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?": 2, "Patience, Illdi. We study the heroes of the past so we can have better understanding of the heroes of today... and tomorrow.": 2, "You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins.": 2, "You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on.": 2, "Always sad when someone has to die.": 2, "Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return.": 2, "Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright.": 2, "It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.": 2, "Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!": 2, "It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.": 2, "Always.": 2, "You have the look of a killer.": 2, "If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information.": 2, "Remarkable, isn't it? This tomb has been hidden for... well, who knows how long. Many centuries, I would think.": 2, "You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though.": 2, "You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential.": 2, "You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day.": 2, "I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?": 2, "Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be.": 2, "Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be.": 2, "You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.": 2, "Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?": 2, "You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.": 2, "It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day. ": 2, "I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.": 2, "It has been an honor, Skaal-friend.": 2, "If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!": 2, "Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!": 2, "Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him.": 2, "You have? Where? Tell me now!": 2, "You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.": 2, "It can't be... please, All-Maker, send him back to us...": 2, "Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.": 2, "You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and that costs us gold... which means you don't get any.": 2, "I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.": 2, "You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?": 2, "I can't go any further, Shield-Sister.": 2, "You honor Khajiit with your presence.": 2, "You here to see Rulindil, too, eh? None of my business of course.": 2, "Regaining Pale Pass would help our supply situation considerably... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath...": 2, "Although... it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap...": 2, "Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?": 2, "Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.": 2, "You heard what she said, Ulfric.": 2, "You heard what she said, Tullius.": 2, "If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call.": 2, "You heard the man, Ulfric.": 2, "You heard the man, Tullius.": 2, "Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire.": 2, "Hurry! Before Alduin your life devours bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!": 2, "If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught.": 2, "If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.": 2, "You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!": 2, "You hear anything?": 2, "Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?": 2, "Hurry over to our military camp tucked away in the Reach. Ulfric's been enjoying those silver mines for far too long.": 2, "Always a pleasure...": 2, "Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.": 2, "Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.": 2, "It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed.": 2, "You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?": 2, "You. Over here!": 2, "You have questions?": 2, "It has its advantages. I've never liked having the Empire perched on my doorstep. And Riften would be easy to hold...": 2, "Huh. I had heard you died.": 2, "If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king.": 2, "You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you.": 2, "An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.": 2, "If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!": 2, "It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.": 2, "Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands.": 2, "Aaaaah!": 2, "You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise.": 2, "You have business with Clavicus Vile?": 2, "You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.": 2, "Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.": 2, "I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.": 2, "Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses.": 2, "Aaaaagh!": 2, "Papa! You're home!": 2, "Hsssss!": 2, "You have a mighty voice!": 2, "Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word.": 2, "And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash.": 2, "You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away, if you would have me.": 2, "You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end.": 2, "Papa! You're back!": 2, "And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me.": 2, "Hsss! Dead. Who did this?": 2, "Hsss": 2, "It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.": 2, "And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.": 2, "And I have. Humiliating at first, but I knew he would let his guard down eventually. That he would come to trust I was under control.": 2, "If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around.": 2, "Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation.": 2, "Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.": 2, "You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about.": 2, "An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.": 2, "Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.": 2, "If I must die to protect my people, so be it!": 2, "It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.": 2, "Huhn!": 2, "You... you go first.": 2, "Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.": 2, "An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this.": 2, "An astute observation.": 2, "Huh? What do you want?": 2, "You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.": 2, "An axe of great vengeance. Each fragment is precious.": 2, "You have much to learn... But you have proven your will is strong and your heart is devoid of pity.": 2, "It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.": 2, "I can't pay, I can't!": 2, "It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship.": 2, "I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid.": 2, "An intruder in the Sepulcher!": 2, "You have kept up your end of the bargain nicely. I admit, I wasn't sure that you would.": 2, "It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans.": 2, "It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky.": 2, "You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves.": 2, "You have found my beacon.": 2, "Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.": 2, "If I had it, I'd pay! There's no need to do that!": 2, "You have earned the right to call yourself my Champion.": 2, "I can't remember how long I've been here. Has it been a day or a century?": 2, "I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like.": 2, "You have done well.": 2, "You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it.": 2, "However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits.": 2, "All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.": 2, "Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?": 2, "Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...": 2, "You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...": 2, "You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...": 2, "You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.": 2, "You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point.": 2, "Please, we need to speak in private.": 2, "Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.": 2, "You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.": 2, "You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.": 2, "I can certainly share a bit of what I know.": 2, "You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today.": 2, "You'd best hurry it up.": 2, "If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods.": 2, "Please, will you help me? There's no one here I can trust.": 2, "Ah! Dragonsreach! There are many difficulties, but I cannot think of a better plan.": 2, "You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility.": 2, "If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort.": 2, "Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.": 2, "You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?": 2, "Ah! I am now like the Shadowscales of old.": 2, "I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea.": 2, "You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess.": 2, "I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim.": 2, "If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster.": 2, "Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.": 2, "Pleasant weather for a war, no?": 2, "Ah! No more! Don't hurt me again.": 2, "Please. Come in. Musn't talk in the Ratway.": 2, "If you get arrested, it's on your head.": 2, "If you're looking for passage, talk to Captain Gjalund.": 2, "Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come.": 2, "You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like.": 2, "You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away.": 2, "I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.": 2, "You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.": 2, "Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining.": 2, "If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.": 2, "Agreed.": 2, "Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult.": 2, "Agreed. To the death.": 2, "If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person.": 2, "You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.": 2, "You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.": 2, "Ah Please! Don't hurt me!": 2, "Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.": 2, "You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.": 2, "If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning.": 2, "If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal.": 2, "Please, stop!": 2, "Please don't mind Joric. He's not mad, really he's not.": 2, "You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by.": 2, "If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man.": 2, "You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur?": 2, "I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District.": 2, "Please, tell me you have good news.": 2, "If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College.": 2, "You'd do well to remember that.": 2, "If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others.": 2, "Please, there isn't much time. What is it?": 2, "Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?": 2, "Ah yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory.": 2, "Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!": 2, "Ah yes.": 2, "Please, reconsider what you're doing. Maybe I can pay later...": 2, "Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere.": 2, "If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip.": 2, "Ah, a man of action.": 2, "If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me.": 2, "If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect. Now that'd be something, eh?": 2, "Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you.": 2, "Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition.": 2, "If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy.": 2, "If you don't watch it, I may actually start to respect you. Job well done.": 2, "If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip.": 2, "If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.": 2, "Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand.": 2, "If you don't mind getting your feet wet, your best bet is to head north past the mill. The odd tomb or two along the way won't bother you.": 2, "Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it...": 2, "If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out.": 2, "If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs.": 2, "Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay.": 2, "Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.": 2, "If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead.": 2, "You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?": 2, "You will not break me, outsider.": 2, "You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape.": 2, "If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!": 2, "You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition.": 2, "Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!": 2, "Ah, dangerous...": 2, "You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen.": 2, "You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade.": 2, "Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts.": 2, "If you desire to fight me, then let's get this over with.": 2, "If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do.": 2, "You withdraw from Falkreath, and allow Siddgeir to resume his rightful place as Jarl.": 2, "Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.": 2, "You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar.": 2, "Pit bait.": 2, "I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you.": 2, "You wouldn't attack an old woman again, would you?": 2, "You wouldn't attack an old man again, would you?": 2, "Ah! What did you do? Stop that!": 2, "Please. Take your time.": 2, "Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.": 2, "Ah, Borkul muscle one out of you on your way in? Fine. Take this one.": 2, "Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power.": 2, "I appreciate that.": 2, "I appreciate it.": 2, "If you find any more candidates bring them here. ": 2, "Ah, I see. Well, it's possible that the property will still be available when you amass the necessary funds.": 2, "If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it.": 2, "I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple.": 2, "You won't take my eye, man-thing!": 2, "You won't regret it. Here's the title to your steading.": 2, "Please... end this misery.": 2, "Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept.": 2, "I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files.": 2, "If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first.": 2, "If you've come here to hunt, there is plenty of game to be found.": 2, "You won't get the best of me!": 2, "I can go back to my life for now.": 2, "You won't get away.": 2, "I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, if you'll have me.": 2, "You won't get away with that!": 2, "Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding.": 2, "If you ever need more practice with the bow, just grab me.": 2, "Pleasure doing business with you.": 2, "I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own.": 2, "Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family Each time a different injustice.": 2, "If you like. But we need to find a way to unlock that trap door.": 2, "I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector.": 2, "You're back.": 2, "If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath.": 2, "If you want to get paid, keep your weapon sheathed.": 2, "Please, don't be angry with me.": 2, "You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing...": 2, "I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.": 2, "If you see anything you want, take it. You've done so much for me... it's the least I can do.": 2, "If you see anything you like, please, take it! You've done so much for me. It's... it's the least I can do.": 2, "You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.": 2, "Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow.": 2, "I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample.": 2, "Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!": 2, "Please! Don't shoot!": 2, "I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished.": 2, "You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there.": 2, "You're after that damn hilt? Go ahead, try and take it!": 2, "If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion.": 2, "Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters.": 2, "You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.": 2, "After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies.": 2, "If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time.": 2, "Please, just go away!": 2, "You're a slave. Just like us.": 2, "After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?": 2, "If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine.": 2, "You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.": 2, "You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.": 2, "Please stay away while you got that spell on you.": 2, "You're a liar! I won't listen to you. Leave me alone!": 2, "You're back. Have you done what I asked?": 2, "If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table.": 2, "I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.": 2, "Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me.": 2, "If you two are finished with the touching homecoming, there's a city in chaos out there.": 2, "You're going to Riften.": 2, "You're going to Fort Sungard.": 2, "You're going to Fort Snowhawk.": 2, "You're going to Fort Neugrad.": 2, "You're going to Fort Kastav.": 2, "You're going to Fort Greymoor.": 2, "You're going to Fort Greenwall.": 2, "You're going to Fort Dunstad.": 2, "If you want me to come along, it has to just be me and you.": 2, "Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!": 2, "You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool.": 2, "If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around the Flagon all day, that's where your wrong.": 2, "I bet you are. Which one do you want?": 2, "You're disturbing my other customers.": 2, "According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do.": 2, "You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim.": 2, "You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies.": 2, "If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.": 2, "You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!": 2, "Please, come and browse our goods.": 2, "If you think we'll just hand over Riften, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.": 2, "Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.": 2, "If you think this war is nearly won, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.": 2, "If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her.": 2, "I bet you'll be glad to get to Whiterun and get out of this weather.": 2, "If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there.": 2, "If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy.": 2, "Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?": 2, "Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately.": 2, "Aghh..": 2, "If you provoke me, I will be forced to unsheathe my claws.": 2, "If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back.": 2, "If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara.": 2, "If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up.": 2, "You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.": 2, "You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.": 2, "You'll never reach the Emperor! Not while I'm standing!": 2, "You'll never leave this ship alive, cutthroat!": 2, "You'll never get the claw!": 2, "You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition.": 2, "If you're asking, that means you're the new lifer. Tough luck, friend. Those guards sold you out but good.": 2, "Again!": 2, "If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around.": 2, "If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do.": 2, "If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations.": 2, "Please, make it brief. We have much to do.": 2, "Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.": 2, "If you're going to be up here, stay out of my way.": 2, "You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.": 2, "Aggh...": 2, "Agh! Dead body!": 2, "If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard.": 2, "Agh! Flithy n'wah!": 2, "You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.": 2, "Agh! Who did this?": 2, "You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.": 2, "Agh. Agh!": 2, "You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.": 2, "You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves.": 2, "You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.": 2, "If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead.": 2, "You'll pay for your blasphemy!": 2, "Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.": 2, "After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me.": 2, "After what you just experienced, you are not amazed? I am at a loss for words.": 2, "You're a fool to test me, outsider.": 2, "If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...": 2, "I call forth that power! Accept the soul that we offer!": 2, "You're a firebrand, aren't you?": 2, "After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.": 2, "I call upon Oblivion realms. The home of those who are not our ancestors. Answer my plea!": 2, "If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits.": 2, "After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal.": 2, "If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime.": 2, "After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.": 2, "You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.": 2, "If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved.": 2, "After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it.": 2, "You'll... pay for this...": 2, "If you need pickpocket training, just let me know.": 2, "You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.": 2, "You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them.": 2, "I call upon you, Lady Mara!": 2, "You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.": 2, "You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.": 2, "If you'll check the shelves around the balcony, I'll check around the lower level.": 2, "If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you.": 2, "If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.": 2, "After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her.": 2, "You'll serve me soon enough.": 2, "Please, let's hurry.": 2, "I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.": 2, "You'll regret starting this fight.": 2, "After what you did for me, you are always welcome here. Just try to stay out of Master Neloth's way.": 2, "After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.": 2, "Alik'r, hold!": 2, "Ah, excellent. The Jarl was hoping you would be interested.": 2, "Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.": 2, "You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.": 2, "You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.": 2, "I am done being Hermaeus Mora's pawn.": 2, "Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember.": 2, "Prove yourselves to me!": 2, "If they want my city, they're going to have to take it from me personally.": 2, "Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.": 2, "Ah. Some other time, perhaps?": 2, "Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...": 2, "If they love me not, how can my love reach them?": 2, "You're headed to Whiterun.": 2, "Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.": 2, "You're headed to Winterhold.": 2, "Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment. ": 2, "Ah. Well. Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.": 2, "In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.": 2, "In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.": 2, "I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.": 2, "Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!": 2, "I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.": 2, "In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.": 2, "If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true.": 2, "If these ruins frighten you, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here.": 2, "In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks.": 2, "If there's someone in the palace who can speak for you and wouldn't mind walking you around. Great. Lead me to him.": 2, "In time, I believe I will.": 2, "In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over.": 2, "In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit.": 2, "You're headed to the capital.": 2, "You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.": 2, "If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage.": 2, "Prove worthy by warrior's test, and cross the bridge to the blessed hall.": 2, "Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.": 2, "If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too.": 2, "I can teach you a few things.": 2, "You're headed to Markarth.": 2, "I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge.": 2, "If trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becomes a burden, and you find yourself in Winterhold, visit me at the College.": 2, "You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least.": 2, "If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?": 2, "You're headed to Morthal.": 2, "Ah, you saw that, did you?": 2, "If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric.": 2, "You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain.": 2, "You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes.": 2, "If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life.": 2, "In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose.": 2, "Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine.": 2, "Protect the Jarl with your lives!": 2, "You smell like a pig's pen, too. What a stink! Have you been rolling in the dirt all day?": 2, "You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!": 2, "You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things.": 2, "Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?": 2, "Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company.": 2, "You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential.": 2, "You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause.": 2, "Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.": 2, "In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara. ": 2, "In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve.": 2, "Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.": 2, "Ah. I believe I can be of help here.": 2, "Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech.": 2, "You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in. Talos preserve you.": 2, "Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia...": 2, "'Bout time. Brynjolf's been gettin' on me about money.": 2, "You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.": 2, "Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.": 2, "Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin, which you cannot do without my help.": 2, "You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.": 2, "If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild.": 2, "If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps.": 2, "Alduin always was pahlok - arrogant in his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.": 2, "Zu'u nis. I cannot do that.": 2, "You see what talking to them gets us?": 2, "Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.": 2, "You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader. ": 2, "Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!": 2, "Alduin has returned, just like the prophecy said!": 2, "You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?": 2, "You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.": 2, "You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.": 2, "You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.": 2, "You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it.": 2, "You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!": 2, "You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.": 2, "Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.": 2, "Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart.": 2, "I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps.": 2, "Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.": 2, "Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!": 2, "Alduin, feyn do jun, kruziik vokun staadnau, voth aan bahlok wah diivon fin lein!": 2, "Alduin, his hunger insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed valley.": 2, "I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe.": 2, "Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?": 2, "Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true, we're all doomed anyway.": 2, "If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.": 2, "You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back.": 2, "Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again.": 2, "Indeed. Come, there is much to be done.": 2, "Ahhh... It's good to be home.": 2, "You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!": 2, "Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale.": 2, "Pull up a seat and have a drink.": 2, "Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.": 2, "Ahhhh!": 2, "You should find no difficulty using the portal any longer.": 2, "Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful.": 2, "Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.": 2, "Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm. ": 2, "You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help.": 2, "I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.": 2, "Perhaps the hofkahsejun - the palace in Whiterun... Dragonsreach. It was originally built to house a captive dovah.": 2, "You're here because we're abominations in your mind. Evil creatures that need to be destroyed.": 2, "Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar.": 2, "You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl.": 2, "Ahrk fin Kel lost prodah, do ved viing ko fin krah, tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!": 2, "Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!": 2, "Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod, rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!": 2, "Push off, will you?": 2, "Indeed it is.": 2, "Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.": 2, "Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests.": 2, "Aicantar let me see his museum. It's really nice.": 2, "I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.": 2, "I am an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! Oh very well, but make it quick.": 2, "Put that down, you mangy cat!": 2, "You seem to have a knack for this kind of thing. I'll make sure people in charge know.": 2, "Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.": 2, "Ain't nothing pretty about a corpse. No matter how fresh.": 2, "I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.": 2, "In some cases, a few never awoke at all.": 2, "If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return.": 2, "If you change your mind, I'll be here.": 2, "I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine.": 2, "You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!": 2, "In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl.": 2, "You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.": 2, "In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.": 2, "About time you showed up.": 2, "Ah, kill it. Kill it!": 2, "I am the shadow at your back.": 2, "Pfft. Snowback.": 2, "Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.": 2, "You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?": 2, "You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.": 2, "You want the Emperor? You'll have to get through us!": 2, "You want something or not?": 2, "In a manner of speaking.": 2, "I can only give you my word as a priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.": 2, "You want me to do something or not?": 2, "Pff. Go away, if you know what's good for you.": 2, "Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it!": 2, "Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.": 2, "You want a fight? You got it.": 2, "You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.": 2, "I can pat you on the back all day, but coin's coin, right?": 2, "I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate.": 2, "You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I have never seen anything quite like it.": 2, "I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves. ": 2, "Ah, now that's a good idea. Head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.": 2, "If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you.": 2, "You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?": 2, "You turned me invisible!": 2, "You want to talk to me? Okay.": 2, "Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn.": 2, "Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.": 2, "You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned.": 2, "You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?": 2, "Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing.": 2, "Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new here? ": 2, "Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here.": 2, "Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess.": 2, "You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.": 2, "You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.": 2, "Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time.": 2, "Imperial forces will withdraw from The Pale, and Jarl Skald the Elder will be allowed to return to Dawnstar.": 2, "You're going to the fort.": 2, "Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.": 2, "I am watching, Skaal-friend.": 2, "Imperial troops will withdraw from Winterhold, and Kraldar will return as Jarl.": 2, "You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.": 2, "Imperials! Kill them!": 2, "You were born into the pack, sister.": 2, "You were born into the pack, brother.": 2, "Important deliveries to make! No time for chatting!": 2, "You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left him?": 2, "You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?": 2, "Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn, then...": 2, "Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder...": 2, "Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll.": 2, "Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll.": 2, "You wanted to see me?": 2, "Impressive, you've mastered the shadows.": 2, "If you change your mind, speak to Braig. Tell him I sent you. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.": 2, "You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll.": 2, "Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.": 2, "I can provide you with some help with her minions. ": 2, "In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams.": 2, "Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up.": 2, "Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim!": 2, "If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.": 2, "Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal.": 2, "You there.": 2, "In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.": 2, "Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you to arrive.": 2, "Present yourself to Lord Harkon at once.": 2, "You there! What are you doing?": 2, "I can smell your blood!": 2, "I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.": 2, "If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back.": 2, "In life I felled foes unnumbered, fearless in battle; but no blade can defend against the terror of this gloom-stricken valley.": 2, "Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on.": 2, "I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered.": 2, "Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?": 2, "Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much.": 2, "In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it!": 2, "Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.": 2, "You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal.": 2, "You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship.": 2, "In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.": 2, "I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case.": 2, "You're headed to Dawnstar.": 2, "You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.": 2, "You're headed to Falkreath.": 2, "If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us.": 2, "If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy... it's the center of their operations in Skyrim...": 2, "I can take you to any of the hold capitals.": 2, "I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My real name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell.": 2, "You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off.": 2, "If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother.": 2, "If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister.": 2, "You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you.": 2, "You treat us fairly. Thank you.": 2, "In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.": 2, "If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard.": 2, "I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.": 2, "You think you're finished? I've got plenty more where that came from.": 2, "Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.": 2, "In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly.": 2, "You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.": 2, "You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!": 2, "In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. I might rather consider Whiterun.": 2, "In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly.": 2, "In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly. How about the Reach? Gaining control of the silver mines would be invaluable.": 2, "You... You're wrong! You can't hurt me anymore...": 2, "I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel.": 2, "I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame.": 2, "In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years.": 2, "If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits.": 2, "Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years.": 2, "Precisely!": 2, "If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you.": 2, "You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?": 2, "I am not! You're lying!": 2, "In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen.": 2, "Prepare to leave this world!": 2, "I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see.": 2, "Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars.": 2, "You thieving little elf!": 2, "Prepare yourself.": 2, "You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information.": 2, "You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.": 2, "It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them. ": 2, "You dare try and steal from me?": 2, "She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.": 2, "Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.": 2, "Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout.": 2, "(grunt)": 2, "Without the royal blood flowing through you, you're one step away from the rest of the thralls.": 2, "I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.": 2, "I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.": 2, "Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves.": 2, "It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child.": 2, "Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event.": 2, "Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay.": 2, "As for you, General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever.": 2, "It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.": 2, "(hiss!)": 2, "Only bit I could make out was \"repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,\" and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.": 2, "She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...": 2, "It's so c-c-cold here! If I play outside for too long, I'm going to freeze solid!": 2, "It's so good to see you again.": 2, "Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.": 2, "As in death there is new life, in Oblivion there is a beginning for that which has ended.": 2, "With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold.": 2, "She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what.": 2, "It's still coming!": 2, "It's strange holding a hilt that isn't connected to a dagger. Oh well.": 2, "As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging.": 2, "With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat.": 2, "With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.": 2, "As long as the rebels are willing to die fighting the Empire, we must be willing to oblige them.": 2, "Only a couple more.": 2, "Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.": 2, "Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.": 2, "She is here, among us.": 2, "Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.": 2, "Hold your breath if you're superstitious. We're passing Shroud Hearth Barrow. Everyone knows spirits guard the old treasure there.": 2, "I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.": 2, "Wonderful. This will be a splendid addition to my private collection.": 2, "As a Nightingale, I took an oath and was sworn to secrecy.": 2, "As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher.": 2, "As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.": 2, "Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations.": 2, "It's over! Everyone stop!": 2, "Wonderful. I'll sleep better knowing you're watching the southern marches. Here's the title to your steading.": 2, "Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?": 2, "I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. ": 2, "It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect.": 2, "Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.": 2, "Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!": 2, "She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness.": 2, "As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.": 2, "Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!": 2, "I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you.": 2, "A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with...": 2, "I'm sure you have something in mind.": 2, "It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.": 2, "As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!": 2, "Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster.": 2, "Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!": 2, "As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place.": 2, "Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.": 2, "She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!": 2, "Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute. ": 2, "I'm sure we'll speak again.": 2, "Wo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul, voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein!": 2, "Hold your fire until he's close!": 2, "As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?": 2, "It's the Legion!": 2, "As the sun ends the night, end the darkness of this soul, return life to the creature you see before you!": 2, "It's time for you to leave, my friend.": 2, "Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm...": 2, "Winterhold will be turned over to the Empire, although the College itself will retain its traditional neutrality.": 2, "As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay.": 2, "She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers.": 2, "It's time to act.": 2, "Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that.": 2, "Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?": 2, "It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!": 2, "Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?": 2, "It's time we had a real king. One of our own making.": 2, "Wind guide you.": 2, "She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...": 2, "As you command, Thane. I'll guard Heljarchen House until you return.": 2, "As you command, Thane. I'll wait at the White Hall in Dawnstar until you need me again.": 2, "It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.": 2, "A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer.": 2, "As you command. Mu daal wah golt.": 2, "As you desire.": 2, "One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin.": 2, "She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself.": 2, "Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.": 2, "She was... he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We barely found enough of her to bury.": 2, "Hmph. Suit yourself. I can't promise someone else won't buy it in the meantime, though.": 2, "As you say, it will happen.": 2, "You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own.": 2, "Why? What did I do?": 2, "Why? We had a deal Madanach. A deal!": 2, "As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends.": 2, "It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.": 2, "As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle.": 2, "I do not know - but none have passed through.": 2, "With pleasure, my Listener!": 2, "It's the damn outlanders and Empire that need the reasons.": 2, "With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too.": 2, "Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken.": 2, "As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas.": 2, "With mead and fellowship let's mend our wounds.": 2, "I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.": 2, "She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war.": 2, "With good planning and constant vigilance.": 2, "As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen! ": 2, "As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of \"Ro.\"": 2, "With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive.": 2, "I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.": 2, "With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely.": 2, "As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client.": 2, "I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.": 2, "She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that.": 2, "With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little.": 2, "With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor.": 2, "It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!": 2, "One thousand steps and a thousand more...": 2, "You're not afraid of me, are you?": 2, "As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready.": 2, "It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!": 2, "As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open the door.": 2, "As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here.": 2, "Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on.": 2, "It's the waiting that gets me.": 2, "It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.": 2, "I do not know how he came to be caught. But the bronjun... the Jarl... was very proud of his pet. Paak!": 2, "Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.": 2, "Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.": 2, "Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined.": 2, "It's nice to see a friendly face around here. Everyone else can be so grumpy.": 2, "It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.": 2, "Onward to our next adventure!": 2, "Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere.": 2, "I'm watching you.": 2, "Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.": 2, "Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it.": 2, "I'm warning you. Back off!": 2, "It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.": 2, "Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.": 2, "It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.": 2, "Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you.": 2, "Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?": 2, "Are your ears still ringing? I hope that goes away.": 2, "Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you... ": 2, "It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die.": 2, "It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.": 2, "Yay!": 2, "Aren't you already running a job for Aela? Come talk to me when you finish that up.": 2, "Aren't you already running a job for Farkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.": 2, "Aren't you already running a job for Skjor? Come talk to me when you finish that up.": 2, "Aren't you already running a job for Vilkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.": 2, "It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love.": 2, "Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.": 2, "You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.": 2, "I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible.": 2, "Set an ambush along the road between, or camp by one of the inns.": 2, "It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep.": 2, "Set an ambush on the road between, or camp one of the inns.": 2, "Are you truly ready to die?": 2, "Y...Yes?": 2, "Hope you're not getting too wet back there.": 2, "I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.": 2, "Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge... they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar.": 2, "Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us.": 2, "I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.": 2, "It's just up here.": 2, "It's just us against a dragon, is that it?": 2, "Are you ready to face the Guild?": 2, "It's kind of an amusing tale.": 2, "Yeah. That's what it's going to take.": 2, "Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?": 2, "Yeah. So?": 2, "Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.": 2, "Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway.": 2, "Yeah, you need something?": 2, "I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that.": 2, "Yeah, yeah.": 2, "Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt.": 2, "I did. Your time, it seems, has come.": 2, "I'm yours to command, Thane. I'll wait here until you need me.": 2, "Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!": 2, "Are you sure you can find your way? It would be easy to get lost in here.": 2, "I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds.": 2, "Are you sure you wouldn't rather explore, say, a nice tavern?": 2, "Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?": 2, "I'm with you, Thane.": 2, "Yeah, sure, okay.": 2, "Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.": 2, "Yeah, rub it in. Just imagine what I could get done with my full power and none of these pesky \"morals.\"": 2, "Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control.": 2, "I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.": 2, "It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.": 2, "Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now.": 2, "I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.": 2, "Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he came back from Atmora.": 2, "Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers.": 2, "It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.": 2, "Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored.": 2, "It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.": 2, "I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in.": 2, "Honestly, I'm a little worried. Markarth is nice enough, but... I wonder if it's really safe for children.": 2, "Around here, you'll want to learn to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions.": 2, "Arrgh!": 2, "Only those who have suffered long can find the light within the shadows.": 2, "Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.": 2, "Only those who can trace their ancestry through Harkon's mortal blood line can faithfully accept the power conferred by his Vampiric blood.": 2, "I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast.": 2, "Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds.": 2, "It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.": 2, "Arugh!": 2, "Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn.": 2, "Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better.": 2, "I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.": 2, "Working on those standing stones feels like a bad dream. I'm glad you woke us from it.": 2, "Home? Well, where is that? Some dusty crypt or frigid cave?": 2, "I'm telling you, this one is different...": 2, "As I expected, you favor your friends.": 2, "Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...": 2, "She cannot hide from us forever.": 2, "Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.": 2, "As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side.": 2, "She did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.": 2, "It's on the north coast of Hjaalmarch, with a magnificent view of Solitude on its crag. Just the place for a new manor house.": 2, "Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.": 2, "Would you now?": 2, "Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he cut through the elven hordes that once swarmed this land.": 2, "Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you.": 2, "Would you raise your shield in his defense?": 2, "Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land.": 2, "Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it.": 2, "Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.": 2, "Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.": 2, "Wundun oblaan. We have arrived.": 2, "I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.": 2, "Wrong or right, the Mythic Dawn changed Tamriel's history. They deserve study.": 2, "Hoo jah.": 2, "It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.": 2, "I'm too swift for you!": 2, "Wow. Would you look at that.": 2, "Arkay helps us find peace with death.": 2, "Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.": 2, "Shadows fall!": 2, "Wow, thanks Papa!": 2, "Wow, thanks Mama!": 2, "Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!": 2, "Wow, really? What'd you get me?": 2, "Wow! What was that? Do it again!": 2, "I'm too busy tending to the dead to spend my time making more of them.": 2, "Wow! That was fun. Do it again!": 2, "I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.": 2, "Shadows preserve us. So it's true...": 2, "Wow! I'm see through!": 2, "Wow! I can't wait to see my new home!": 2, "Wow!": 2, "Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?": 2, "Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard and we're going to poison the mead.": 2, "You, of all people. Get out!": 2, "Would you raise your shield in her defense?": 2, "I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.": 2, "Hmph. Nothing there.": 2, "As you wish. Just don't forget about me.": 2, "Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.": 2, "Hmm? No, no. No! I'm too close now. Can't take the time.": 2, "Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.": 2, "I'm relieved you discovered a bottle intact; this place looks as though it was ransacked by the orcs.": 2, "Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen.": 2, "Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery.": 2, "Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.": 2, "I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.": 2, "Just be sure to keep your eyes open and your guard up.": 2, "Aye. I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild.": 2, "Who are you? What do you want?": 2, "Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be.": 2, "Aye. Let us forget our sorrow in the fury of battle.": 2, "Who are you?": 2, "Just between us, I've got more important things to do than attend these meaningless parties.": 2, "I'm ready. Let's go.": 2, "Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you.": 2, "Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?": 2, "Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.": 2, "I'm ready.": 2, "Azura bless you.": 2, "Azura curse you!": 2, "I'm ready, let's continue.": 2, "(snort)": 2, "Azura help us!": 2, "Whiterun seems like a better choice to me. From there we can threaten to undermine the whole Imperial position.": 2, "Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?": 2, "Azura light your steps.": 2, "Hmm... these are interesting reports...": 2, "Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that.": 2, "Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.": 2, "I'm right with you.": 2, "Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?": 2, "Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us.": 2, "Aww... come on. Just a few more minutes? Please?": 2, "Aww... stop teasing me!": 2, "Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath. ": 2, "A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then?": 2, "Aye! We haven't forgotten Markarth, Tullius!": 2, "Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit.": 2, "Shor's bones, boy. What did I tell you? ": 2, "Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?": 2, "Who would like to open the negotiations?": 2, "You're not getting anything from me!": 2, "Who will start?": 2, "Who will speak for him?": 2, "Who will speak for her?": 2, "Shor's bones, girl. What did I tell you? ": 2, "Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!": 2, "Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense.": 2, "Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.": 2, "Shor's bones, where will these demands end?": 2, "Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.": 2, "I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it.": 2, "Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him.": 2, "Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere \"pranks.\"": 2, "Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood.": 2, "Shor's favor found me today. Let's lift a mug of mead together, our wounds to salve and weariness cure.": 2, "Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits.": 2, "Shor's hall, shimmering across the clouded vale. But quenched was hope by the shrouding mist - my mind is darkened. ": 2, "Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute.": 2, "Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today.": 2, "Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself.": 2, "Whoa.": 2, "While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would.": 2, "Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.": 2, "Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.": 2, "(woof!)": 2, "Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it.": 2, "Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.": 2, "Show us the path to the prey.": 2, "Back with good news I trust.": 2, "I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.": 2, "Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?": 2, "Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.": 2, "Where you off to? There's work to be done.": 2, "I'm originally from Cyrodiil, sent here at the request of the Emperor himself. I'm often ordered to places with problems that need fixing.": 2, "I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.": 2, "Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice.": 2, "Backup! I need some help in here!": 2, "One day I'll inherit his power. It will all be mine. Mark my words.": 2, "I'm one of the last members of the Blades.": 2, "Bad people who don't like werewolves. ": 2, "Where is this \"Darkfall Cave?\"": 2, "I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it.": 2, "Bafagra badee.": 2, "Where is he? The one who was asking about the fugitive hiding in the Ratway?": 2, "I'm on your side!": 2, "Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?": 2, "Where have you been?": 2, "Bah! Stop wasting my time!": 2, "Where do you want to go?": 2, "Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms from this council.": 2, "Shut up, will you?": 2, "Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. Let me give you the details.": 2, "You're not getting that treasure.": 2, "While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party.": 2, "Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?": 2, "Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.": 2, "Azura's wisdom to you, friend.": 2, "I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it.": 2, "Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!": 2, "While the blessed state of undeath can be \"accidentally\" conferred - consider the brutish creatures you find wailing in dank hovels in the wild...": 2, "Hmm... the Empire is bringing in a lot of supplies through Dawnstar. Taking the Pale would stretch them pretty thin...": 2, "Just follow the road south from Dawnstar, past Fort Dunstad, then head south.": 2, "You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.": 2, "Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.": 2, "While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline.": 2, "Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well.": 2, "Back from whence you came, heathen!": 2, "Which, I'm sorry to say, means your usefulness is at an end!": 2, "Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor.": 2, "I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.": 2, "Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?": 2, "Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on.": 2, "Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.": 2, "Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice.": 2, "Back off.": 2, "Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you.": 2, "Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.": 2, "Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions.": 2, "Which brings me to my present concern.": 2, "Whew. That was close.": 2, "Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good.": 2, "I'm promoting you to Quaestor.": 2, "Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.": 2, "I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.": 2, "Just go away!": 2, "Show the rebels the futility of their cause.": 2, "One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up. ": 2, "Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.": 2, "Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?": 2, "It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.": 2, "Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.": 2, "She's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.": 2, "At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough.": 2, "It's... it's everything I could have hoped for.": 2, "I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends.": 2, "At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.": 2, "I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you.": 2, "I'm sorry, but I think you've had enough for the moment.": 2, "At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.": 2, "At least Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.": 2, "A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!": 2, "Why is it always raining?": 2, "You...must...die.": 2, "One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?": 2, "It... it worked. Mara be praised!": 2, "Hmph. ": 2, "She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.": 2, "She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.": 2, "At least the pain is gone...": 2, "At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal.": 2, "Why don't you take your coin and keep walking?": 2, "Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.": 2, "I'm sorry, I should really go now.": 2, "Why don't you stay dead?": 2, "Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over.": 2, "At least you remembered to bring me the information I requested. Give me that.": 2, "She's supposed to be on our side?": 2, "Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?": 2, "(hiss...)": 2, "Why don't you just kill me already.": 2, "Hmph. Fine. Go on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach knows more than you think.": 2, "It's you! Please, don't hurt me!": 2, "Why?": 2, "Why... why did you do that?": 2, "One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever.": 2, "She'll answer any questions you have.": 2, "I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak...": 2, "As you've been traveling in the Soul Cairn, your body has become attuned to it.": 2, "It's true that Whiterun is dangerously exposed as long as the Stormcloaks hold Markarth...": 2, "Hmph. Looks like we got a cutthroat skulkin' around...": 2, "I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters.": 2, "She's agreed to be your forebear.": 2, "I'm sorry. Good luck.": 2, "Ask all you want, you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Not in this part of the world anyway.": 2, "I'm sorry, you're going to have to leave. Tell Brynjolf he'll just have to make due without my coin.": 2, "I do!": 2, "Why you...": 2, "Assassins? No, nothing so crass.": 2, "It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell.": 2, "It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell.": 2, "Why you little filcher...": 2, "I'm sorry, that can't be done.": 2, "She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay.": 2, "It's very particular, and very important.": 2, "Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.": 2, "One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.": 2, "It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out.": 2, "I'm sorry, just... Just don't hurt me. I know you're not one of them, but you just can't help them. You can't let them know I'm here.": 2, "Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week...": 2, "It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?": 2, "It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile.": 2, "At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.": 2, "Awaken, and perish!": 2, "Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one.": 2, "At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years.": 2, "One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets for the Thalmor... there's one more I must bring...": 2, "Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.": 2, "Why are you standing here then?": 2, "Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?": 2, "Jarl Ulfric.": 2, "Jarl Ulfric...": 2, "Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?": 2, "Shoot the far target.": 2, "Shoot the left target.": 2, "Shoot the middle target.": 2, "I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately.": 2, "I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about. ": 2, "Shoot the right target.": 2, "Shor as well - he welcomes all heroes to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it.": 2, "One moment I'm raising a sword against that necromancer, the next moment I found myself here. What happened?": 2, "Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.": 2, "I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble.": 2, "One lives for the things he is willing to die for.": 2, "Why are we doing this again?": 2, "Why are they hurting each other?": 2, "Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...": 2, "Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away.": 2, "Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.": 2, "Shor's Hall awaits, if worthy you prove.": 2, "Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt.": 2, "Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.": 2, "I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.": 2, "Shor's blood, the Thu'um!": 2, "Aw, that's so sweet of you! Thanks!": 2, "Why aren't you at Honningbrew Meadery?": 2, "Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?": 2, "Why can't I just die? I fear I'm cursed to walk this desolate land forever.": 2, "Shhhhhh...": 2, "Hmmph. Another wanderer. I suppose you'll be wanting potions, just like the others.": 2, "One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.": 2, "Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?": 2, "At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.": 2, "At once. Zu'u fen al.": 2, "J'zargo is listening.": 2, "At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.": 2, "One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.": 2, "J'zargo is ready for more adventure.": 2, "Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.": 2, "J'zargo only has so much room to carry things.": 2, "I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation.": 2, "Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now...": 2, "I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies.": 2, "At this loss...": 2, "At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless.": 2, "I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.": 2, "I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.": 2, "Shh! Master Neloth is concentrating. At least I think he is. He might be sleeping with his eyes open again.": 2, "Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?": 2, "I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere.": 2, "One moment. But don't go far. I expect I'll need you.": 2, "Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!": 2, "Shhh.": 2, "Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.": 2, "Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin.": 2, "Shhh. They're watching us. Always watching.": 2, "Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this.": 2, "I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...": 2, "Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!": 2, "Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?": 2, "I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?": 2, "Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap...": 2, "I've never felt this brave.": 2, "You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.": 2, "It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.": 2, "You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.": 2, "And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered.": 2, "It will be a good day. I can feel it in my gut.": 2, "I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.": 2, "Rules, is it, Tsavani? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted.": 2, "It will be done.": 2, "And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?": 2, "You are human again. Like the rest of us.": 2, "You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.": 2, "It will be good to finally be able to return home.": 2, "Rulindil, pah! One day, the shoe will be on the other foot.": 2, "You are exactly what I was looking for.": 2, "It will be so.": 2, "You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.": 2, "I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.": 2, "I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that.": 2, "I've mastered the shadows... and now your life is mine!": 2, "And what makes you think that?": 2, "I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm.": 2, "Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, Raerek, is a faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim - he still supports the Empire, after all.": 2, "And what might you need? Hmm?": 2, "How kind of you. And I've brought an army to give you a going away parade.": 2, "I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone.": 2, "Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out.": 2, "It won't die, it just keeps coming!": 2, "And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?": 2, "You are nothing.": 2, "I've lost the way and wander blindly.": 2, "It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways.": 2, "You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, \"Dah,\" which means \"Push.\"": 2, "Our vengeance will come.": 2, "You bear my ring.": 2, "I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.": 2, "You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!": 2, "And their arm.": 2, "How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?": 2, "Our terms are simple.": 2, "You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town.": 2, "And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.": 2, "Roggvir. You damn fool.": 2, "It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.": 2, "Our struggle is our people's struggle.": 2, "It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.": 2, "Rolff says I shouldn't go to the Grey Quarter anymore. He said it's not safe there.": 2, "Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again...": 2, "And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home.": 2, "How long until they arrive?": 2, "How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. ": 2, "Rraaah!": 2, "And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.": 2, "Rraaarrgghh!": 2, "It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.": 2, "And they were no base prey.": 2, "You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.": 2, "I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me.": 2, "You are strong. Stronger than I believed possible.": 2, "I've never liked having the rebels right on Solitude's doorstep. Retaking Hjaalmarch would help secure our supply lines...": 2, "I've never liked having the Imperials right on Windhelm's doorstep. Retaking Winterhold would help secure our supply lines...": 2, "A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us.": 2, "You are now ready for your last trial.": 2, "How may I serve you, my Listener?": 2, "You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death.": 2, "It worked, then? Let me see!": 2, "You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?": 2, "S'rendarr's mercy!": 2, "You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that. ": 2, "Saadia, as you know her, is wanted by the noble houses of Taneth for treason. We were hired to see her returned to Hammerfell for her crimes.": 2, "It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.": 2, "Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and collect a larger share of the market. I can't have that.": 2, "Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead.": 2, "And you avenged him.": 2, "It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look.": 2, "How does it move so damn fast?": 2, "And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.": 2, "And you don't want to talk to Borkul the Beast.": 2, "Yes? What do you need?": 2, "Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull.": 2, "And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit.": 2, "I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen.": 2, "Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend.": 2, "It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it.": 2, "Yes... one of his allies could tell us. Motmahus... But it will not be so easy to... convince one of them to betray him.": 2, "I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era.": 2, "Yes...": 2, "And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?": 2, "Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price.": 2, "Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do.": 2, "Yes. With Markarth in our hands, we'll be able to raid the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...": 2, "It's Mercer! Look... down there!": 2, "I challenged him in the traditional way, and he accepted. There were many witnesses. No \"murder\" was committed.": 2, "I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true.": 2, "And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.": 2, "You a fighting man? How about a little bet?": 2, "It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.": 2, "S'rendarr be merciful! What ill fortune that this should happen now, while we are trying to make a living.": 2, "And would you raise your sword in her honor?": 2, "And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave.": 2, "How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.": 2, "You approach as if you know us, stranger. Who are you and what do you want?": 2, "You ants don't have the power to bind me!": 2, "You anger one, you anger us all!": 2, "And where can we find this nameless old man?": 2, "Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need. ": 2, "You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know.": 2, "You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.": 2, "Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him.": 2, "I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?": 2, "And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed.": 2, "How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?": 2, "You an assassin or a thief? Next time, keep your blade sheathed if you want to make any gold.": 2, "You always were a quick study.": 2, "You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield.": 2, "You always protected us. I hope you find peace in the next life. Goodbye, old one.": 2, "How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!": 2, "Running out of room, eh? I'll be glad to help.": 2, "I cast shadows across your grave!": 2, "And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you.": 2, "How goes the investigation?": 2, "Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.": 2, "And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!": 2, "You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.": 2, "You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.": 2, "And with the rebels thinking us occupied elsewhere for the time being, we'll be able to take them by surprise.": 2, "And would you raise a mug in her name?": 2, "And would you raise a mug in his name?": 2, "And would you raise your sword in his honor?": 2, "Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us then. Before the bruniikke - the Akaviri - came and killed all my zeymah.": 2, "And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!": 2, "I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.": 2, "It shall be done.": 2, "And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!": 2, "I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.": 2, "Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver.": 2, "It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion.": 2, "(Growling)": 2, "You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?": 2, "I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his \"singin'\" is gonna get his throat cut.": 2, "Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.": 2, "And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened.": 2, "You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!": 2, "You cannot defeat us! The Dragonborn still stands!": 2, "And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?": 2, "You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.": 2, "I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.": 2, "You can't tell them!": 2, "And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills.": 2, "And now you pay for meddling in the Thalmor's affairs.": 2, "You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you people a single coin.": 2, "A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.": 2, "You can't kill what you can't see!": 2, "I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me.": 2, "You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.": 2, "Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.": 2, "You can't hide from the hidden.": 2, "You can't hide from a Telvanni wizard!": 2, "Out with it. What happened at the meadery?": 2, "And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.": 2, "You can't have the ring back! You made a commitment!": 2, "And my children?": 2, "You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!": 2, "I've waited long for such a worthy opponent.": 2, "You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.": 2, "I... I don't care! I'm not paying!": 2, "However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me.": 2, "Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.": 2, "Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.": 2, "It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.": 2, "You dare defy your father?!": 2, "You dare challenge me?": 2, "And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money.": 2, "Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink.": 2, "And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.": 2, "It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.": 2, "You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!": 2, "It seems cowardly.": 2, "You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.": 2, "And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.": 2, "You could trap him there, exactly.": 2, "Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go.": 2, "Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats.": 2, "I, his only son, forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter I had smuggled out of prison. Such is the love of Titus Mede for his subjects.": 2, "You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.": 2, "You could have just asked.": 2, "It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater.": 2, "You could have been mighty, if fate had decreed otherwise.": 2, "And lead the Companions to further glory. ": 2, "I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!": 2, "You could be the one I seek... if your will is strong, lure a thrall to my shrine. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice. Then slay him.": 2, "I've... failed...": 2, "You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing.": 2, "I can't wait here forever.": 2, "It seems we may have an agreement.": 2, "You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.": 2, "You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.": 2, "I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.": 2, "Rip the eyes from his head!": 2, "You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here.": 2, "I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.": 2, "I've sent men to scout out the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.": 2, "It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir.": 2, "You can buy me whatever you want!": 2, "You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!": 2, "You can be a part of a tremendous power - all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power...": 2, "You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.": 2, "Out of my way!": 2, "And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than... whatever that is.": 2, "You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know.": 2, "Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.": 2, "It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.": 2, "I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now.": 2, "Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be.": 2, "It was anger that brought each of us here, but it is love that keeps us fighting.": 2, "You both agree to this?": 2, "Ro means \"Balance\" in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus - \"Force\" - to focus your Thu'um more sharply.": 2, "And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst.": 2, "I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?": 2, "It was fascinating to watch those tentacles grow out of your eyes.": 2, "Ro...": 2, "I've seen a puzzle like this before... there's got to be another lever to pull, but you'd better hurry. A septim says this mechanism's on a timer.": 2, "And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!": 2, "And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.": 2, "And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!": 2, "It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.": 2, "I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me.": 2, "You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?": 2, "Out with it. Time is money.": 2, "Rip the eyes from her head!": 2, "You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt.": 2, "Out with it, then.": 2, "A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.": 2, "I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.": 2, "And of course, they'll be caught off guard thinking we're off doing something altogether different.": 2, "You can't beat me!": 2, "A word of advice. Don't disappoint me.": 2, "You're losing this war and you know it.": 2, "I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.": 2, "I can't wait to see what the future brings.": 2, "You're losing this war, and you know it.": 2, "And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory.": 2, "And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!": 2, "You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!": 2, "How pathetic, being forced to eke out a miserable existence in a place like this.": 2, "I can't wait!": 2, "And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter.": 2, "Right. You adventuring types would never go into a room just to steal everything.": 2, "It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor sharp point. I owe everything to him.": 2, "I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us.": 2, "How much?": 2, "And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer.": 2, "You can see Azura's Shrine for miles on a clear day. You people did a good job with that, I'll say it to anybody.": 2, "And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater - wisdom now useless.": 2, "I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs.": 2, "You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.": 2, "It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me.": 2, "And so slain the beast inside of me.": 2, "And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual.": 2, "And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.": 2, "Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um for myself.": 2, "Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details.": 2, "I claim the glory of your defeat, Dovahkiin!": 2, "It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.": 2, "Yes, child?": 2, "It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.": 2, "See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?": 2, "See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know.": 2, "I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives.": 2, "Yes, but it's no easy matter. ": 2, "Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet.": 2, "I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable.": 2, "Yes, but I need a show of loyalty from you. I don't need a shiv in the back while we break out.": 2, "See ya' round.": 2, "I've been sailing the Northern Maiden across the Sea of Ghosts for nearly twenty years now.": 2, "I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master.": 2, "Are we ready to proceed?": 2, "Yes, and we have something special for you this time.": 2, "Orc town nearby. Between you and me, we should have had them out years ago.": 2, "I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.": 2, "Are you a Greybeard?": 2, "It's fine... I had to tell someone I suppose.": 2, "I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen. ": 2, "Are you alive? I must be imagining this.": 2, "Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.": 2, "Yes, Thane. Be careful.": 2, "I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine. ": 2, "I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time.": 2, "Yes, Listener?": 2, "I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help.": 2, "Yes, Listener.": 2, "Are you awake? ": 2, "I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!": 2, "Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name.": 2, "Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.": 2, "It's coming loose. I can feel it.": 2, "See that you do.": 2, "Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.": 2, "I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.": 2, "Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed.": 2, "Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?": 2, "Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case.": 2, "I've been working on a shield for Aela.": 2, "I've been wanting to say thanks for being a friend. Here. It's not much, but I was thinking you might like to have this.": 2, "How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.": 2, "Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.": 2, "Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on.": 2, "Yes, ma.": 2, "How can I?": 2, "You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.": 2, "Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.": 2, "Yes, let's get this over with.": 2, "Yes, let's get down to it.": 2, "Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.": 2, "Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear.": 2, "I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open.": 2, "Yes, it is. The Jarl thought of you when it came up for sale.": 2, "Yes, it is. It's in the southern part of the Pale, right on the border with Whiterun Hold. All the room in the world to build your own house.": 2, "Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of \"Kest.\"": 2, "Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of \"Nah.\"": 2, "Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of \"Wuld.\"": 2, "Yes, indeed.": 2, "Araa.": 2, "It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do... as an instrument of limitless wealth.": 2, "How can I assist, hmm?": 2, "Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't.": 2, "I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit.": 2, "I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?": 2, "Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!": 2, "Are you bothering me for a reason?": 2, "Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name.": 2, "Yes, I have something special for you. ": 2, "It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!": 2, "Are you kidding me? Look at this place.": 2, "Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes.": 2, "I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth. ": 2, "Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?": 2, "Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately.": 2, "I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.": 2, "I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire.": 2, "Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin.": 2, "It's held many names: Dagger of the Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer.": 2, "Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!": 2, "Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!": 2, "Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!": 2, "Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on.": 2, "How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another!": 2, "I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.": 2, "Yes sir.": 2, "Housecarl! No!": 2, "I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.": 2, "Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!": 2, "I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...": 2, "It's in the south of the Pale, near Giants' Gap. Just the spot for someone like you to establish a steading.": 2, "It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute.": 2, "Are you out of your mind? We said no bloodshed! Well, guess what. You can just forget about your gold.": 2, "Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind.": 2, "I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic.": 2, "I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.": 2, "Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.": 2, "Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you.": 2, "Yes, I hope this helps.": 2, "Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not.": 2, "Yes, I've heard the Guild is rising back to power. An alliance would be most beneficial to both parties.": 2, "Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?": 2, "It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.": 2, "Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be?": 2, "Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her.": 2, "How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some \"shaving.\" Ha ha.": 2, "Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?": 2, "Yes, I'll be ready in a moment, I just need one more thing...": 2, "How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well.": 2, "How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them.": 2, "Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already.": 2, "It's good to have everyone not running off to that damn sacred stone every night. I suppose I have you to thank for that.": 2, "Yes, I think you'll be just what I need. ": 2, "Are you feeling sick?": 2, "Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.": 2, "Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?": 2, "I've been hearing rumors of Silver Hand activity.": 2, "Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that.": 2, "I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.": 2, "Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you.": 2, "I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him.": 2, "It's good to see you all in one piece. Who is this?": 2, "Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.": 2, "Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me.": 2, "Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise.": 2, "I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim.": 2, "I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's been looking for me, I've been watching them.": 2, "A welcome to you, fellow traveler.": 2, "It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence.": 2, "Are you joking?": 2, "Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?": 2, "Secure the door.": 2, "You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.": 2, "Sahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah, ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!": 2, "I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.": 2, "I consider this conversation over.": 2, "Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.": 2, "I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.": 2, "Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?": 2, "Our blood grants us power to calm and relax. If you currently lack the gift, forgo feeding for a day and that power will come naturally.": 2, "It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.": 2, "I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.": 2, "Another one. Terrible.": 2, "Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are.": 2, "Another quiet day.": 2, "Another quiet day... I hope.": 2, "Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say.": 2, "Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!": 2, "Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with \"everyone's best interest.\" I find I'm only concerned with my own.": 2, "(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door)": 2, "Our actions have always been one in the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.": 2, "Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions.": 2, "Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected... ": 2, "Yes, yes. What is it?": 2, "I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.": 2, "Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.": 2, "Our Lord! She has come!": 2, "I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?": 2, "Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink.": 2, "It's about Ranmir.": 2, "It's about time Brynjolf sent me someone with business sense. I was beginning to think he was running some sort of beggar's guild over there.": 2, "It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?": 2, "Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her.": 2, "I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality.": 2, "I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge.": 2, "Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.": 2, "And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons.": 2, "And, as much as I'd like to kill the man myself, we can't risk an all out war with the Empire. We'll bide our time for now...": 2, "I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.": 2, "I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire.": 2, "And, soldier. You better help win me back Markarth, or die trying. It was your brilliant strategy to give it over to the rebels in the first place.": 2, "It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.": 2, "It's a blessing given to the most honored of the Companions.": 2, "Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called \"The Dreamstride\"; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.": 2, "Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.": 2, "It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.": 2, "Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged.": 2, "Yes. Please, follow me.": 2, "I climbed all the way up to the temple, but they said I wasn't old enough to get in. They're just mean.": 2, "It's a fine property. Well-watered, plentiful stands of timber, beautiful view.": 2, "Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home.": 2, "How do you like my new laboratory? I use it to dissect spriggans. I've learned so much from them.": 2, "And?": 2, "Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.": 2, "I've had to be careful handling those blade shards you found. They're each sharp enough to sever a finger with no effort.": 2, "It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete.": 2, "Yes. It's on the north coast of Hjaalmarch, with a magnificent view of Solitude on its crag. Just the place for a new manor house.": 2, "I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck.": 2, "Yes. It's a fine property. Well-watered, plentiful stands of timber, beautiful view.": 2, "Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.": 2, "I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?": 2, "Yes. I've kept it safely secured here ever since I was imprisoned.": 2, "It's a little gift from the dwarves. Who knew they would end up helping our cause?": 2, "It's a little late for that, don't you think?": 2, "I come home to you, All-Maker...": 2, "Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.": 2, "Yes, yes. I haven't got all day...": 2, "Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?": 2, "Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is.": 2, "Yes, the Steward is taking visitors. However, I must accompany you at all times while on the royal premises.": 2, "It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.": 2, "It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.": 2, "It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village.": 2, "I've failed you... forgive me...": 2, "It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient.": 2, "How could you possibly know about...": 2, "Anything I can get you?": 2, "Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.": 2, "How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.": 2, "Yes, that'd be entirely out of character.": 2, "Anything else before you go?": 2, "How could you do that to me!": 2, "Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?": 2, "Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?": 2, "How could they trick me like this? I was one of Reman's court wizards!": 2, "I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave.": 2, "I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day.": 2, "How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?": 2, "How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?": 2, "Yes, pa.": 2, "Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news.": 2, "Anything you need, Listener.": 2, "I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!": 2, "Anything, as long as I get to fight.": 2, "Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you...": 2, "Yes, of course you are right. Still, I would give much for even a few grains of moonsugar.": 2, "How come you here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing.": 2, "Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?": 2, "Scholars from around the world will come here one day.": 2, "Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!": 2, "I've failed... the mortal has escaped.": 2, "I've figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.": 2, "Any Nord can learn the Way of the Voice by studying with the Greybeards, given enough ambition and dedication.": 2, "I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?": 2, "It's all in the swing. Let me show you.": 2, "Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...": 2, "Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running.": 2, "A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes.": 2, "Ouch! Hey!": 2, "Otherwise, you're a threat to all of us.": 2, "I've got a feeling about this one.": 2, "You're naked!": 2, "Say what you will about the dark elves, but they did a proper job with Azura's Shrine. Can see it for miles on a clear day.": 2, "Any luck finding the Butcher?": 2, "It's almost getting downright hot out now.": 2, "It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.": 2, "Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.": 2, "Any luck on your end?": 2, "How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.": 2, "It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.": 2, "How dare they cast me from the Battlespire! I will make them pay dearly.": 2, "How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!": 2, "Any news of the Alik'r?": 2, "Any other ideas?": 2, "It's an entirely different situation. I don't expect you to comprehend the nuances of these matters.": 2, "I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think.": 2, "Yes, to General Tullius. ": 2, "Yes, thuri. Wah golt. I will land at once.": 2, "Yes, thuri.": 2, "Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim.": 2, "How could you, Erandur...": 2, "I've finally found you! I want to join the College of Winterhold. But I need help with my wards. Can you teach me?": 2, "How dare you defile this temple, orc!": 2, "Come find me if you need more marksman training.": 2, "Can I get you a drink?": 2, "Come here a second.": 2, "Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.": 2, "Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house.": 2, "There's no house available, but I could sell you a fine piece of land where you could build your own house.": 2, "Excellent.": 2, "Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless.": 2, "There's no escape.": 2, "Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.": 2, "I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances.": 2, "There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.": 2, "I should've finished you when I had the chance!": 2, "Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you.": 2, "There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.": 2, "I should slay you for such insolence!": 2, "There's more of them somewhere around here.": 2, "Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!": 2, "Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows.": 2, "Ni faas, Dovahkiin!": 2, "Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah - victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat Alduin in open battle.": 2, "There's got to be some way out of here!": 2, "I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.": 2, "Of course! You don't remember getting here.": 2, "There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.": 2, "Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.": 2, "There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim.": 2, "Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes. ": 2, "There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?": 2, "Excellent. We're glad to have you as a landowner in Hjaalmarch. Here's the title to your steading.": 2, "Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim.": 2, "I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.": 2, "Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime.": 2, "There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.": 2, "New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.": 2, "I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.": 2, "Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore.": 2, "You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You shall now be known as Stormblade.": 2, "Have anything for us yet?": 2, "Of course, Thane. How can I be of service?": 2, "There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim.": 2, "Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.": 2, "There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.": 2, "There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.": 2, "There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?": 2, "Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss.": 2, "Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock.": 2, "I have nothing to say to that murderer.": 2, "Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?": 2, "Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you.": 2, "Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close.": 2, "I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen.": 2, "Thalmor got their embassy up that way. If I had my way, the lot of those yellowback elves would wake up in a box back to Summerset tomorrow.": 2, "Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?": 2, "Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook.": 2, "There's no reason to fight.": 2, "Thank Her Benevolence it wasn't burned like the other tomes.": 2, "Excellent!": 2, "There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.": 2, "Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.": 2, "Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains. ": 2, "There's no need for that.": 2, "I have no words. Talk to Anwen.": 2, "There's an old man. He lives in Riften.": 2, "Has he? I suppose he doesn't want to miss a chance to bluster about the Empire's many crimes.": 2, "There's a man named Braig inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest.": 2, "Faaz! Nah!": 2, "Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.": 2, "I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness.": 2, "There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more.": 2, "There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit.": 2, "There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so.": 2, "Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own.": 2, "Nnnnyyaarrggh!": 2, "Nnnnyyaarrgghh!": 2, "Nnnyyaarrgh!": 2, "Your doom has come, damned worm!": 2, "Fail, and it won't matter anyway.": 2, "There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?": 2, "Failure is not an option.": 2, "Of course you will. I have commanded it!": 2, "Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!": 2, "There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?": 2, "Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...": 2, "I shall not be bound.": 2, "Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still...": 2, "Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still...": 2, "Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched.": 2, "Hardly worth giving up Markarth for, but not a bad starting point.": 2, "Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still...": 2, "Hardly likely.": 2, "I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.": 2, "There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.": 2, "I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.": 2, "Faaa rawala.": 2, "I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.": 2, "I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.": 2, "There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.": 2, "I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.": 2, "There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed.": 2, "I should have killed you and your mother long ago!": 2, "Nice weather for a ride. Hope it lasts.": 2, "Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.": 2, "There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.": 2, "Excuse me.": 2, "Nice. Here, this is what you'll need to know.": 2, "There's a way out through here!": 2, "Nicely done. Here's your share.": 2, "Nid!": 2, "I have slain more dangerous creatures than you!": 2, "Thank you for coming, brother.": 2, "Thank you for coming, sister.": 2, "Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.": 2, "There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.": 2, "Thank you for coming.": 2, "Thank you for keeping that matter of the Ash Guardian just between us. I shudder to think what would happen if Master Neloth had found out.": 2, "Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.": 2, "There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.": 2, "There's a sentry patrolling the area. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.": 2, "Eyes on the prey, not the horizon.": 2, "Eyes open and walk with the shadows.": 2, "There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock.": 2, "I should bring some of these Dwemer artifacts to the Arcane University in Cyrodiil for study.": 2, "Nivahriin joorre!": 2, "Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.": 2, "Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?": 2, "There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?": 2, "Need some gold? I may have some work for you.": 2, "They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.": 2, "I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run.": 2, "Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.": 2, "Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less.": 2, "Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?": 2, "Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.": 2, "Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself.": 2, "I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice.": 2, "I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?": 2, "Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.": 2, "Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me.": 2, "Need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.": 2, "Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?": 2, "These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that.": 2, "These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.": 2, "These terms are not acceptable. You know that.": 2, "Tell me!": 2, "Ever taken a swim in the Illinalta? Take care you don't get nipped if you do. Folk say it's teeming with slaughterfish. Who knows what else.": 2, "These ruins might be interesting if I wasn't already an expert on Nordic history.": 2, "These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more.": 2, "Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it?": 2, "These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.": 2, "Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?": 2, "Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil.": 2, "These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?": 2, "These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat.": 2, "They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? \"Season unending\"... so it has proved.": 2, "Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.": 2, "I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.": 2, "I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do.": 2, "They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about.": 2, "Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?": 2, "I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side.": 2, "Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched, unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap.": 2, "Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion.": 2, "They challenge us to be our best.": 2, "Tell him I sent you. Ask him why he's here. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.": 2, "Have you ever heard of the expression, \"the scale of the Argonian that bit you?\"": 2, "Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!": 2, "I have my own expenses you know...": 2, "They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.": 2, "They call him \"the Skinner.\"": 2, "They call her \"the Skinner.\"": 2, "Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.": 2, "I suppose it's time I give him an answer...": 2, "I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...": 2, "I suppose it's not a total loss then.": 2, "Tell him, Ulfric.": 2, "Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does.": 2, "Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.": 2, "Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.": 2, "Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems.": 2, "Need a ride?": 2, "Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.": 2, "I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't.": 2, "They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item. ": 2, "Of course. But I can't just hand that over. Privacy, after all.": 2, "Need any more pickpocket training, you just let me know.": 2, "These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun.": 2, "These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?": 2, "These jobs aren't going to finish themselves you know.": 2, "Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?": 2, "Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.": 2, "Never thought I'd see you again.": 2, "There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name.": 2, "Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care.": 2, "I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on.": 2, "Everyone talks, in the end.": 2, "Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!": 2, "Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.": 2, "I still don't have my Gleda back.": 2, "Everyone will see it! she said. Of course! That was my problem with it.": 2, "There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.": 2, "I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday.": 2, "I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it.": 2, "There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.": 2, "Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back.": 2, "Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?": 2, "You've arrived at last. The hero who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.": 2, "You've arrived at last. The heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.": 2, "Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!": 2, "Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares.": 2, "New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me.": 2, "There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him.": 2, "New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.": 2, "There's plenty more work for the likes of you.": 2, "There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?": 2, "There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?": 2, "Have them send some men - with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.": 2, "Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck.": 2, "Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.": 2, "These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.": 2, "Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.": 2, "These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.": 2, "Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?": 2, "Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?": 2, "I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.": 2, "These dreams are real I tell you. Real!": 2, "These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.": 2, "Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!": 2, "Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?": 2, "Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge.": 2, "These caves... they harbor ill omens, I can sense it.": 2, "Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.": 2, "These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.": 2, "Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy.": 2, "Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind.": 2, "These are the terms currently on the table.": 2, "These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race.": 2, "Of course, not as many pilgrims these days.": 2, "These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape.": 2, "These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts.": 2, "Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better.": 2, "These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh?": 2, "Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore.": 2, "Never mind, I'm dead already-": 2, "Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from this council.": 2, "Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.": 2, "Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.": 2, "Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine. ": 2, "Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway.": 2, "I have something to say first.": 2, "There you are. I had wondered where you got to.": 2, "Faith? I don't have faith in anyone.": 2, "Then the judgment of this Circle is complete.": 2, "Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood!": 2, "No turning back now.": 2, "No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad.": 2, "Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers.": 2, "Of course I do.": 2, "Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.": 2, "I said move!": 2, "Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons.": 2, "Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.": 2, "Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.": 2, "I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!": 2, "Filthy fetcher!": 2, "Filthy pickpocket!": 2, "I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.": 2, "Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!": 2, "Then leave.": 2, "I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.": 2, "I haven't heard a true shout in generations!": 2, "A long time ago, a man named Hrothmund left the Skaal to form his own tradition.": 2, "No! I'm losing the binding.": 2, "I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?": 2, "Then it's decided.": 2, "Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something.": 2, "Odahviing will come to your challenge. Boziik. Krilot. He will not be able to resist your call, from the Hill of the Dovah itself... he will come.": 2, "Then it is too late. The lie has already taken root in the hearts of men.": 2, "I return to the shadows...": 2, "Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.": 2, "No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!": 2, "Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!": 2, "You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?": 2, "No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up.": 2, "Then you leave me no choice!": 2, "Then you know the hard looks as judgment gets set upon you. The sneers of people who never had to face sentence.": 2, "No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.": 2, "Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn.": 2, "Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!": 2, "Felling Alduin was a mighty deed, and I thank you for it. He would have proved troublesome to me.": 2, "Then you are weak and inconsequential.": 2, "Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.": 2, "No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it.": 2, "No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead.": 2, "No shouting match between dragon and man, no fire or fury did this battle entail.": 2, "Hahahaha!": 2, "I saw it fair when first I trod this long-sought path. The pain and fear vanished, dreamlike, and a vision beckoned -": 2, "Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.": 2, "No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.": 2, "Then we stood and fought, our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's ranks wavered.": 2, "Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.": 2, "Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.": 2, "I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.": 2, "Then we have nothing more to say to one another.": 2, "Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.": 2, "Then we have a deal.": 2, "No thanks to you, Casimir.": 2, "I saw a Thalmor the other day. He was really scary!": 2, "Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.": 2, "Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.": 2, "No time, I have business to conduct.": 2, "Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence... they blind your wisdom as well.": 2, "Finally, someone with backbone. Here you go.": 2, "Hafahoo?!": 2, "I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.": 2, "Then I have no work for you.": 2, "Then I have an important task for you.": 2, "Obey!": 2, "No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. It's a potion, made from those dragon parts. Give it a try.": 2, "Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.": 2, "I really thought you'd be able to save me.": 2, "Habichaaalakawaramalek.": 2, "Fine! I'll just... leave the rest of it. Let's go, then, if you're in such a hurry.": 2, "I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.": 2, "Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery.": 2, "Their disappearance, of course!": 2, "I really don't want to fight.": 2, "Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again.": 2, "I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.": 2, "Thank you. Thanks... for everything.": 2, "Ha. We admire your fighting spirit, Orc-Kin. You'll fit right in here. Come inside.": 2, "I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now.": 2, "Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin' out of everythin' I offer you.": 2, "The, uh... the lab is too small. Also, I need the ashy soil.": 2, "Fine, fine. Living out here on our own will take some getting used to, but I think it'll be good for us.": 2, "I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived.": 2, "The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself.": 2, "The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?": 2, "I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.": 2, "Nuz aan sul, fent alok, fod fin vul dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak ahrk ruz!": 2, "Fine, just fine. This house is perfect for a growing family.": 2, "Then I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.": 2, "Had they placed their faith in magic instead of machinery, the Dwemer might still be around.": 2, "Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines.": 2, "Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die.": 2, "Od - Ah - Viing. \"Winged Snow Hunter,\" as I read it.": 2, "Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count.": 2, "Finally, we have an agreement.": 2, "Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few.": 2, "Then come for me, \"son of Skyrim.\" Come for me!": 2, "Then come for me, \"daughter of Skyrim.\" Come for me!": 2, "Finally.": 2, "No! Someone help me! Please!": 2, "Thank you. I'll be here.": 2, "A living Dwemer was once discovered in Morrowind. Can you imagine it, being the last surviving member of your race?": 2, "No! That urn was priceless!": 2, "Then by all means, go about your business.": 2, "Finally. Now I can get back to work.": 2, "Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject.": 2, "A little snow never stopped me, don't worry.": 2, "Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.": 2, "No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.": 2, "No! You're going to break it!": 2, "Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought.": 2, "I remember that axe.": 2, "I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.": 2, "No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about.": 2, "Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.": 2, "Find me if you're ever lookin' for some extra coin.": 2, "Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.": 2, "Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight.": 2, "Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.": 2, "I remember a cutpurse trying to rob me on the road once. When I drew Grimsever, I think the poor man soiled his armor!": 2, "I remember you... you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?": 2, "I suppose thanks are in order.": 2, "No problem, I'll handle it.": 2, "No problem, I'll get someone else to take it.": 2, "Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority.": 2, "There isn't someone less busy who can help you?": 2, "Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay.": 2, "Hang on Mercer! I'm coming to help!": 2, "I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague.": 2, "There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over \"laws\" that have no real purpose.": 2, "I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.": 2, "A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.": 2, "No killin' or no pay. Remember that.": 2, "There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.": 2, "There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree.": 2, "Far have I traveled to bring you these fine goods. Come and see what I offer.": 2, "No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!": 2, "There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.": 2, "There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.": 2, "There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt.": 2, "Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.": 2, "Farewell, Brother Casimir.": 2, "Farewell, Enthir... words can't express...": 2, "I see... Give the papers to my Steward.": 2, "I have to admit. This is more fun that I thought it'd be.": 2, "There is much beauty in this place.": 2, "I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?": 2, "Halt, outlander. By the Code of Malacath, this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome.": 2, "A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.": 2, "I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's help...": 2, "There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic. ": 2, "I sense nothing nearby.": 2, "I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?": 2, "There may be a way out, down this way.": 2, "There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!": 2, "Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am.": 2, "There will be. Of that, you can be assured.": 2, "There will be a feast in our honor when we return.": 2, "Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt. ": 2, "No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?": 2, "No doubt she'd like you to lead her into such a place. Then, when you're alone and beyond help, the fangs will come out!": 2, "No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?": 2, "Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.": 2, "Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear.": 2, "There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.": 2, "I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.": 2, "There we are!": 2, "I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it.": 2, "You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.": 2, "Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.": 2, "Falkreath will be returned to Imperial control, under the authority of Jarl Siddgeir.": 2, "Falkreath will be turned over to Ulfric, and Dengeir of Stuhn will return as Jarl.": 2, "Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.": 2, "Thank you for your kindness.": 2, "There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!": 2, "There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. ": 2, "I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun.": 2, "Of course we did, icebrain.": 2, "Fall, damn you, fall!": 2, "Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.": 2, "Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.": 2, "Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.": 2, "There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.": 2, "No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand?": 2, "No more!": 2, "No more! I yield! I yield!": 2, "There are lots of scary people here, Mama. Promise you'll keep me safe?": 2, "No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.": 2, "I have work if you've got the backbone.": 2, "No one ever escapes. There is no escape. Why would you even try?": 2, "There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe. ": 2, "There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.": 2, "There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.": 2, "I have work to do.": 2, "There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room.": 2, "Hail, comrade! Shall we by clash of steel ease the gloom of the encompassing mist?": 2, "Then... there is hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must... we must...": 2, "Then... there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do was watch our doom approach, helplessly.": 2, "I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.": 2, "No one talks to Madanach, I'm afraid. Not without getting past Borkul the Beast.": 2, "Feel free to look around. We have a fine selection of herbs here at Angela's Aromatics.": 2, "Thank you, outlander.": 2, "Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster.": 2, "Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.": 2, "Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you.": 2, "I saw you do that, you know.": 2, "No problem! How can I help?": 2, "No problem, I can carry a good bit of gear.": 2, "Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman.": 2, "Feel like doing a bit of shopping... the Guild way?": 2, "Feel like doing a bit of writin'?": 2, "Feel the Benevolence of Mara!": 2, "No problem, I'll find someone else. Don't worry about it.": 2, "No one dies. Remember that. We're not assassins.": 2, "There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.": 2, "I see no reason to fight.": 2, "I see no reason to keep fighting.": 2, "Farewell, then.": 2, "There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits.": 2, "Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place.": 2, "There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.": 2, "Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...": 2, "Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.": 2, "No more.... No more!": 2, "There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air.": 2, "Farkas!": 2, "There aren't any houses for sale in Morthal. But if you're interested, I could sell you land in the hold where you could build your own house.": 2, "There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages.": 2, "Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty.": 2, "Halt!": 2, "Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.": 2, "I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?": 2, "There are some sealed doors up ahead. Perhaps you can figure out how to get them open.": 2, "Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there.": 2, "There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.": 2, "Fate decreed that you had to die so that I could win my freedom.": 2, "Fate drives you, but you follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil.": 2, "Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?": 2, "Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge.": 2, "There are others who would gladly accept my favor. ": 2, "There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.": 2, "Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you.": 2, "I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.": 2, "No one can defeat me.": 2, "No one can escape his hunger, here or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end. Nothing can stop him!": 2, "I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true. ": 2, "Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.": 2, "I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.": 2, "They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.": 2, "I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.": 2, "I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.": 2, "He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.": 2, "I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk.": 2, "My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.": 2, "This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life.": 2, "This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside.": 2, "This is no place for you.": 2, "I think you overestimate Ulfric's chances. He's stretched himself too thin.": 2, "Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.": 2, "He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.": 2, "He can't treat me like that. He needs me.": 2, "I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true son of Skyrim here today.": 2, "I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true daughter of Skyrim here today.": 2, "I think you may have joined the wrong side. You showed yourself to be a true friend to the Empire today.": 2, "This is more than I ever could have hoped for. Thanks. Thanks so much.": 2, "Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours.": 2, "My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness.": 2, "Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.": 2, "This is just like old times.": 2, "This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good.": 2, "My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons.": 2, "I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.": 2, "This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road.": 2, "I think you and I have some things to talk about.": 2, "Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you.": 2, "My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days.": 2, "I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.": 2, "This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.": 2, "This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.": 2, "Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do.": 2, "Oh my. How precious.": 2, "Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.": 2, "This is the last time I'll say it. Get out.": 2, "He didn't say, but you'd better move fast.": 2, "I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.": 2, "This is the first time I've set foot in Windhelm. What a dreary place.": 2, "This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here.": 2, "This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here.": 2, "This is the end for you!": 2, "You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.": 2, "This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.": 2, "Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.": 2, "Surprised you've never heard of it.": 2, "This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.": 2, "He did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.": 2, "...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the \"Gourmet\"...": 2, "My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!": 2, "This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.": 2, "He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything.": 2, "I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend.": 2, "This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!": 2, "Your freedom? Yes. But even if you were to escape Cidhna Mine, your name would still be stained with all that blood.": 2, "This is our stronghold. Leave.": 2, "My hatred for the Empire is bested only by love for my countrymen.": 2, "This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head.": 2, "I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?": 2, "He couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain.": 2, "I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.": 2, "This is the only way, Dragonborn. The only way I can be free.": 2, "Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed.": 2, "This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!": 2, "My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.": 2, "Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close.": 2, "This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.": 2, "This is a shame.": 2, "My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary.": 2, "Having another port would ease our supply situation considerably...": 2, "My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons.": 2, "Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means?": 2, "Take care of yourself.": 2, "My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.": 2, "I think there's something in the basement. I'm afraid to go down there.": 2, "I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.": 2, "My mother always loved the sea. When I was young, we'd visit Solitude and watch the ships from the bluff. Ah... better times.": 2, "Take care with those flames.": 2, "Take care!": 2, "My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.": 2, "I have a favor to ask.": 2, "...s-sleeping? No! Burn the temple! Kill the priests!": 2, "This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.": 2, "I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.": 2, "This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.": 2, "Take care, now.": 2, "Haven't you got some chores to do?": 2, "My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all.": 2, "This information needs to go straight to the steward. He'll listen to you. ": 2, "I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested.": 2, "Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you all wake up and see what's going on?": 2, "I have a family again. I... I can't thank you enough.": 2, "Oh my word!": 2, "Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?": 2, "My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated.": 2, "You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch.": 2, "Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back.": 2, "...rise from death, Blood of our Blood.": 2, "Swift hunting.": 2, "My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.": 2, "This is great! Wow, thanks!": 2, "He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves. ": 2, "I think we're almost out. Come on!": 2, "Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born.": 2, "Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav.": 2, "I have a buyer with, shall we say, a very odd taste in literature looking for some particular books.": 2, "This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.": 2, "My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.": 2, "My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over.": 2, "Takafala gajoo?": 2, "Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me.": 2, "Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?": 2, "This is exactly what I'm talking about.": 2, "Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.": 2, "Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow.": 2, "I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?": 2, "I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten.": 2, "I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business.": 2, "I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you.": 2, "I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.": 2, "Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son.": 2, "You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar.": 2, "Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?": 2, "I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.": 2, "My favor?": 2, "My father, the great Bear of Eastmarch, died during my imprisonment after the Markarth Incident.": 2, "My daughter is the one who needs your pity. I'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.": 2, "This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.": 2, "Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.": 2, "I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now.": 2, "This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.": 2, "This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery.": 2, "I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.": 2, "He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.": 2, "I told you, it's from my family.": 2, "Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!": 2, "Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?": 2, "Don't like the looks of this.": 2, "Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them.": 2, "I told you, I don't know anything else about it.": 2, "This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?": 2, "This one needs something?": 2, "This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?": 2, "This one always sticks... there we go.": 2, "Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey.": 2, "This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.": 2, "I told you to weed the garden by sunset, and you didn't do it. Now you're in big trouble!": 2, "I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!": 2, "My disciples still follow the difficult path - the Way of the Voice is neither wide, nor easy.": 2, "I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested.": 2, "Sure, feel free to hand me all the gold you want.": 2, "This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only.": 2, "Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you.": 2, "This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!": 2, "Don't make me the fool and let me down, all right?": 2, "Sure! What do you want to play?": 2, "This place is scary. There are monsters in the swamp. I just know it!": 2, "I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.": 2, "I trust everything went well?": 2, "Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.": 2, "I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...": 2, "This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.": 2, "Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.": 2, "Don't leave any of them alive.": 2, "Don't leave me here!": 2, "This smell of dank earth and worm-eaten wood is going to make me lose my last meal.": 2, "Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!": 2, "Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.": 2, "Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.": 2, "This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.": 2, "This should compensate you for your find.": 2, "I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine. ": 2, "This should be interesting.": 2, "This should be fun.": 2, "Don't let it get me. Help!": 2, "This rain will stop eventually. Always does.": 2, "This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?": 2, "This place will be your tomb!": 2, "He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards...": 2, "This place tears at me as though I'm still alive and being drawn and quartered. I... can't stand it anymore.": 2, "Sure thing, friend.": 2, "This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.": 2, "You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.": 2, "Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.": 2, "Sure you finished, but you killed someone to do it. Next time listen to the rules if you want to get paid.": 2, "Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details.": 2, "Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.": 2, "Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you?": 2, "This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.": 2, "Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?": 2, "I hate Markarth. There's nowhere to play! It's all just rocks. Rocks rocks rocks.": 2, "...not dead? Kill them, kill them all!": 2, "This is... this is great! It's everything I could have asked for!": 2, "Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!": 2, "I thought she'd have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago...": 2, "This is your last mistake!": 2, "Don't screw this up.": 2, "This is your final hour!": 2, "I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.": 2, "Sure.": 2, "Don't set anything on fire, all right?": 2, "Sure. A client's relative lost this item in a gambling match and they're paying us to get it back. So much for fair play, huh?": 2, "Don't speak to me, meat.": 2, "This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.": 2, "My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.": 2, "My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him.": 2, "Don't start swinging that thing in here. You break it, you buy it.": 2, "I thought it was crystal clear... no one dies on these jobs. Remember that next time you want to get paid.": 2, "I thought death was a release, not an eternity of torment.": 2, "Oh no you don't!": 2, "Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.": 2, "Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore.": 2, "Oh my. That...": 2, "This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.": 2, "Don't talk to me, defiler.": 2, "Sure, what have you got?": 2, "Sure, what can I do for you?": 2, "Sure, we can talk a minute.": 2, "I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the spoils right here, boss.": 2, "This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.": 2, "My ears hear the truth in your words, and yet my body shakes with the need.": 2, "Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.": 2, "This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor.": 2, "Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.": 2, "Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?": 2, "This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them.": 2, "Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it.": 2, "I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering.": 2, "Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?": 2, "This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned.": 2, "Don't move. Don't move. I have it here, somewhere... never thought it would be any use, but now...": 2, "Don't muck this up.": 2, "This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear.": 2, "I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch.": 2, "This kind of work suits you... and is going to end up makin' you rich.": 2, "Don't patronize me!": 2, "He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!": 2, "This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does.": 2, "Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.": 2, "I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.": 2, "I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!": 2, "This isn't over.": 2, "Don't play dumb, Tullius!": 2, "This isn't happening!": 2, "My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do.": 2, "My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy.": 2, "This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure.": 2, "Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?": 2, "This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay.": 2, "Take extra care you don't hit your head on a low-hanging bit of stone.": 2, "Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little \"rebellion.\" But rest assured, his days are numbered.": 2, "Elisif! I said I'd handle it.": 2, "Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness?": 2, "Elisif...": 2, "Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it.": 2, "I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.": 2, "My what, now? I've never kept a journal, I can assure you.": 2, "I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!": 2, "I swear it rains like this every time I go to Riften.": 2, "Talos protect you.": 2, "Talos save us! It's a dragon!": 2, "Emptiness consumes me.": 2, "Your end draws near!": 2, "Have you met Grisvar the Unlucky? He's rightly named, and he's also a thief and a snitch.": 2, "I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit.": 2, "My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.": 2, "End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule.": 2, "Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?": 2, "Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.": 2, "I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.": 2, "Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...": 2, "I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.": 2, "My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen.": 2, "Of course. Right away.": 2, "I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?": 2, "I surrender... I surrender...": 2, "Talvas, I think I'll start with the burnt spriggan. They don't squirm as much.": 2, "Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open.": 2, "Talos keep you.": 2, "My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem.": 2, "They wanted to use me to deal with Alduin - Hakon and the rest. I chose otherwise.": 2, "Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.": 2, "Talk to Captain Gjalund if you're looking to book passage.": 2, "They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.": 2, "They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out.": 2, "My steel will be your death!": 2, "Off for some wine, eh? Drink one for me.": 2, "My story, huh? Everyone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?": 2, "Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone.": 2, "Of mine? What is it?": 2, "They'll never suspect an attack from the inside.": 2, "My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe.": 2, "They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.": 2, "My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!": 2, "I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.": 2, "They would hunt, they would fight, and the mightiest among them would rise up as leader.": 2, "Either way, it's off limits to you.": 2, "Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy.": 2, "I have faith in you.": 2, "They won't be expecting an attack from the inside.": 2, "They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice. ": 2, "I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.": 2, "Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're... well acquainted if you catch my meaning.": 2, "Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well... if you catch my meaning.": 2, "They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change.": 2, "They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself.": 2, "Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.": 2, "Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.": 2, "Of course... I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.": 2, "They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk.": 2, "They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?": 2, "Have you lost your mind? I thought it was clear I didn't want anyone killed.": 2, "Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine. ": 2, "Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.": 2, "Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.": 2, "Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds.": 2, "They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now.": 2, "Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.": 2, "They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years! ": 2, "Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War.": 2, "They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage.": 2, "Tel Mithryn. It's the home of Master Neloth.": 2, "I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.": 2, "Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?": 2, "Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.": 2, "I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.": 2, "Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man...": 2, "They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.": 2, "They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.": 2, "Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?": 2, "They found it! They actually found it!": 2, "Etienne must know something related to the dragons... who else might know? Greasy Thom... no, they'd see right through him...": 2, "Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself.": 2, "Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?": 2, "Even Khajiit have their limits. No.": 2, "Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.": 2, "Have you found something?": 2, "They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?": 2, "I have metal to dig.": 2, "I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you.": 2, "I suppose you intend to carry off every item of value in these ruins.": 2, "They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.": 2, "I suppose you think you're better than me because you can do that?": 2, "Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking.": 2, "Of course. Let's go.": 2, "Enough games, face your death!": 2, "My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.": 2, "Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that.": 2, "They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure.": 2, "Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.": 2, "Enough of this mindless banter!": 2, "They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.": 2, "They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.": 2, "They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!": 2, "Enough of your lies!": 2, "Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it.": 2, "Enough talk. There's much to do.": 2, "My spies report the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public.": 2, "Enough to make a significant difference in the war.": 2, "Nah. I don't think so.": 2, "They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay.": 2, "Nah...": 2, "They mustn't stop us!": 2, "Enough, Galmar.": 2, "I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? ": 2, "I suppose you're free to frolic with the wenches in the servant's quarters, but anywhere else, you must have an escort. Jarl's orders.": 2, "I have little need for mindless thralls.": 2, "Name it.": 2, "They look like they were made with... well, the ancient Nords used these kinds of curved blades when they embalmed their dead.": 2, "I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information.": 2, "I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.": 2, "Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me.": 2, "I suppose you're right. I should have a little more faith.": 2, "I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work, I just never thought his luck would run out.": 2, "My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element.": 2, "You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next.": 2, "I have a purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose.": 2, "This better be important, I'm quite busy.": 2, "This better be good...": 2, "This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.": 2, "Oh come on, I ain't that dumb.": 2, "This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.": 2, "This ain't the Dark Brotherhood. Next time, you keep the job clean and you'll get your coin.": 2, "This accursed place is nothing but a prison without walls.": 2, "My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.": 2, "This Khajiit guards the others.": 2, "Take that thing down!": 2, "Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored.": 2, "I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.": 2, "Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers.": 2, "Thirsk didn't always make its own mead. No, we used to get by on shipments from Skyrim. ": 2, "Dragons. Master Neloth says they are no match for a Telvanni wizard. But what about a mere apprentice?": 2, "I think it's time for you to get going.": 2, "Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow.": 2, "Think you can steal from me?": 2, "Dragonsreach is so cool! All the kids there are mean, though.": 2, "Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.": 2, "I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.": 2, "Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.": 2, "My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place.": 2, "Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do I.": 2, "Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.": 2, "Draw your last breath, mortal!": 2, "This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?": 2, "Think hard about your loyalties, sister. I expected better from you.": 2, "Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.": 2, "My new steward is...acceptable. If only he made better tea.": 2, "Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!": 2, "My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?": 2, "Dovahkiin! Here I am!": 2, "This has nothing to do with you, so back off.": 2, "Take heed! They've awakened!": 2, "Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal! ": 2, "Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!": 2, "Dovahkiin.": 2, "Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.": 2, "Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors.": 2, "This fight makes no sense.": 2, "This fight is pointless.": 2, "My name is Eorlund Gray-Mane. I work the Skyforge. Best steel in all of Skyrim. All of Tamriel.": 2, "I think she's sitting by the fire. Poor girl.": 2, "Oh dear.": 2, "This damned war has cost us... me... everything.": 2, "This council was your idea, eh? So tell us, what do you think Riften is worth?": 2, "This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.": 2, "Dragonborn!": 2, "Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!": 2, "Dragonborn, do whatever you're going to do!": 2, "Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps?": 2, "I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm.": 2, "My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl.": 2, "Take my beacon to the mount above Kilkreath.": 2, "This cannot be. I am master of my own fate!": 2, "Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.": 2, "This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?": 2, "Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you.": 2, "Think carefully where your loyalties lie... sister.": 2, "Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.": 2, "My servants serve their own purposes. But, if their will is insufficient, nor suitably aligned with mine, I simply destroy them. ": 2, "Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes.": 2, "Take your time. I understand your hesitation.": 2, "My ship... what happened to my ship? Where am I?": 2, "They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty. I've bartered with their leader, Ri'saad, on more than one occasion.": 2, "My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither.": 2, "They're scared of the dragons, too, aren't they? Paying too well. They don't know anything.": 2, "I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace.": 2, "Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.": 2, "Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?": 2, "I think I can teach you a thing or two.": 2, "Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone.": 2, "Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.": 2, "My sister in crime. What'd you need?": 2, "Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.": 2, "I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.": 2, "They're mercenaries, only in it for the money. They're led by a man named Kematu. Get rid of him, and the rest will scatter.": 2, "I have eternity to find you.": 2, "I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...": 2, "Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good.": 2, "Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.": 2, "They're in my head.": 2, "Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us. ": 2, "Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold.": 2, "Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?": 2, "Taking this man to be interrogated.": 2, "I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.": 2, "Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!": 2, "I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here.": 2, "I think I see what I was doing wrong...": 2, "I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.": 2, "My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...": 2, "My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.": 2, "Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet. ": 2, "Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.": 2, "I think given time, you'll understand what I mean.": 2, "Drem. There is no prey here.": 2, "I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.": 2, "Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?": 2, "Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you.": 2, "My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.": 2, "Things have been much calmer since you disposed of Ildari.": 2, "Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it.": 2, "A man who feels no fear has no heart. I know fear. But it does not control me.": 2, "I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though. ": 2, "Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow.": 2, "Thieves used to hole up in Fort Snowhawk there, but they were run out. Wizards, they say. Suits me fine, so long as they mind their own by.": 2, "Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know.": 2, "My previous champion displeases me.": 2, "They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves.": 2, "I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler.": 2, "They've holed up in an abandoned fort in the Reach.": 2, "I have come to rely heavily upon you. It is only fitting that you join the upper echelon. I am hereby elevating you to the rank of Legate.": 2, "Take your seat and we can begin.": 2, "My scouts tell me the inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.": 2, "Dum, di di dum, dum di dum, dum di di di di dum da da dum.": 2, "Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.": 2, "Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.": 2, "They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.": 2, "I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history.": 2, "My carriage is the safest way to travel.": 2, "The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.": 2, "The wind blows bitter cold in this place.": 2, "I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.": 2, "The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!": 2, "Now you die!": 2, "The Jarl's down!": 2, "I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.": 2, "Got plenty, take your pick.": 2, "Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?": 2, "A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...": 2, "A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.": 2, "Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.": 2, "You've done this city a mighty service, friend.": 2, "A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.": 2, "The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...": 2, "The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.": 2, "Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.": 2, "You've done well, hunter.": 2, "You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room.": 2, "A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities.": 2, "I know what path you set him on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.": 2, "Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself.": 2, "I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.": 2, "The Jarl does little to protect us these days.": 2, "Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!": 2, "Not this Empire. The world's better without it. Certainly Skyrim is.": 2, "Go now, the artifact must be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed.": 2, "Go now, with haste. Take my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.": 2, "I know we don't have much money, but I... I wanted to get you something. It's not much, but...": 2, "I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.": 2, "That we could avoid having to kill you.": 2, "The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!": 2, "The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim.": 2, "Not really.": 2, "The Palace looks so pretty. I wish they'd let me inside...": 2, "I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand.": 2, "I hope we bump into each other again.": 2, "The Northern Maiden is ship-shape and ready to go.": 2, "Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.": 2, "The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.": 2, "The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall.": 2, "The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough.": 2, "Go ahead, see for yourself.": 2, "A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!": 2, "The Nightgate and Candlehearth inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.": 2, "Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.": 2, "A healing spell? Was that really necessary?": 2, "The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding.": 2, "The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.": 2, "The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel.": 2, "Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.": 2, "That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.": 2, "I know you thought we weren't losing much when you gave it to the enemy. But I'm wasting troops guarding the border that belong on the front lines.": 2, "The Miasma? But, brother...": 2, "The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.": 2, "Go and pick some fights.": 2, "Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I will be here... unless Alduin returns before you do.": 2, "That was pathetic. It didn't even do anything.": 2, "I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.": 2, "The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases...": 2, "I know you for what you are. This town's blood is ours. Leave it! Now we must return to our roles lest the sheep suspect the wolves.": 2, "I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms.": 2, "That we have forgotten them, this I fear the gods will remember.": 2, "The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.": 2, "I know now that I can't live among people.": 2, "Go. Away. Please!": 2, "Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions.": 2, "The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it.": 2, "That would probably be best.": 2, "The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.": 2, "The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.": 2, "I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see.": 2, "Got all your gold ready, boss. You can count every coin, it's all there.": 2, "Go. Out. Before I change my mind.": 2, "Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.": 2, "The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws.": 2, "Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?": 2, "The Empire would have us become slaves to the Thalmor. We are not slaves. We are men. Free men who will slay anyone who begs to differ.": 2, "I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving once depicted a skull.": 2, "Gods I'm so tired.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.": 2, "The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.": 2, "Go on in, already.": 2, "Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?": 2, "Not without a fight it isn't!": 2, "Go on in.": 2, "That went pretty well, all things considered.": 2, "I know things that the Greybeards will never teach you.": 2, "That which is unknown can create unease, even fear. It is to be expected.": 2, "Go on, then.": 2, "The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor to the final battle.": 2, "That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.": 2, "The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory.": 2, "Got more than you can handle.": 2, "I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.": 2, "Go quiet, break him out, then run. This isn't a suicide mission. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.": 2, "The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?": 2, "Got lots of jobs available. Interested?": 2, "The Greybeards taught you well.": 2, "Got keen eyes? Might see nasty old Hajvarr up on White River Watch. Piece of work. Jarl should just run him out and have done with it.": 2, "I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me.": 2, "I hope you enjoy touring the museum. Just don't touch anything.": 2, "The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it.": 2, "Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri.": 2, "Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her.": 2, "That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet.": 2, "I hope you gave him a swift end.": 2, "Go with the Nine.": 2, "Now what did you want? I already paid you.": 2, "The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey I need to make my mead.": 2, "Go!": 2, "Now what am I supposed to do? I can't be seen in public like this. If I can even be seen at all...": 2, "The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim.": 2, "The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.": 2, "Glory to the Empress of Murk!": 2, "The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so long.": 2, "I hope the tome we need is still intact.": 2, "I hope the tower holds out until we get there.": 2, "The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect with their lives.": 2, "That sound could bring mountains down!": 2, "I like living here. The lake is so pretty.": 2, "The Tree Stone is still corrupted... the land is still out of balance. But with the other five restored... it may be enough. It will have to be.": 2, "The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me.": 2, "The Throne of Ysgramor! The throne of my father...  I only hope I can prove worthy of the honor.": 2, "Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason.": 2, "The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?": 2, "I like it here. The tree in the park is so pretty!": 2, "Not many come to see me. What do you want?": 2, "The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.": 2, "Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.": 2, "I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.": 2, "Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.": 2, "Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!": 2, "Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them.": 2, "Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over.": 2, "The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.": 2, "The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is.": 2, "The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor.": 2, "Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death.": 2, "I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.": 2, "I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it.": 2, "Give me a moment. I still have flashback from when Master Neloth changed you.": 2, "Give me a reason to try.": 2, "Not like that it isn't.": 2, "Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.": 2, "That sky... it feels like I'm being watched. Can't stand it anymore!": 2, "Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?": 2, "The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?": 2, "Get the damn Key and let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!": 2, "Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.": 2, "Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know.": 2, "Not here. Downstairs.": 2, "Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.": 2, "The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever.": 2, "Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.": 2, "Not here. The Underforge. Come on.": 2, "Get to it, then.": 2, "I live in a dark world, where no light shines through. I carry this burden with every step I take.": 2, "The World-Eater waits within the mist! Bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!": 2, "Great! Now I'm going to cast some spells at you. Keep your ward up so I can study it.": 2, "Get up to Winterhold. We're going to take it back.": 2, "Great! Let's go!": 2, "Not if you were the last man in the Empire.": 2, "Not impressed!": 2, "Now, I don't want to alarm you, but there are bandits in these parts. We're safe up here, of course. Just be careful if you're ever here on foot.": 2, "The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?": 2, "The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard and winnow all those souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's lofty hall": 2, "Get your thieving hands off that!": 2, "Get your ward ready.": 2, "I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime.": 2, "The Voice? Here?": 2, "Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone with a little more backbone.": 2, "Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean up the mess.": 2, "Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard?": 2, "Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean.": 2, "Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will withdraw from Hjaalmarch, and Idgrod Ravencrone will resume the Jarlship.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.": 2, "Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk.": 2, "I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?": 2, "That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.": 2, "Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant.": 2, "I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it.": 2, "Not now. The Underforge, tonight.": 2, "The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out.": 2, "The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before. ": 2, "The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.": 2, "The Silver Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of Wuuthrad.": 2, "That was amazing!": 2, "Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her.": 2, "Glad you were here. ": 2, "Glad you're here.": 2, "Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait.": 2, "Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.": 2, "Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.": 2, "Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!": 2, "Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers.": 2, "Not possible.": 2, "Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.": 2, "The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it.": 2, "The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage.": 2, "That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy.": 2, "Not quite worth handing over Riften, but not a bad starting point.": 2, "I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?": 2, "Glory to Nocturnal!": 2, "I know, I know. I'm hurrying.": 2, "That was a long time ago.": 2, "I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct.": 2, "The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.": 2, "The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.": 2, "Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.": 2, "Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.": 2, "Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.": 2, "Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing.": 2, "That voice is power!": 2, "That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road.": 2, "I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.": 2, "Not now, Braith.": 2, "Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.": 2, "The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.": 2, "The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.": 2, "That's what I like to hear.": 2, "That's unfortunate. Maybe I misjudged you.": 2, "I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.": 2, "Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?": 2, "Good! Let's go find something to fight.": 2, "I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.": 2, "A fine place to trap one of Alduin's allies, hmm?": 2, "Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um.": 2, "Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.": 2, "Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away.": 2, "That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that.": 2, "That's enough out of you.": 2, "Good, and take this little message back to your bosses.": 2, "That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.": 2, "I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it.": 2, "Now let's keep moving.": 2, "That's the spirit! Let's go.": 2, "That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief.": 2, "Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us.": 2, "I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can.": 2, "That's the last time I argue with a dremora.": 2, "Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.": 2, "That's the last of them.": 2, "Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well.": 2, "That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.": 2, "Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?": 2, "That's the best I can offer.": 2, "That's what I thought. Now get out of my way, baby. I got things to do.": 2, "Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go.": 2, "That's what I wanted to hear. Good luck out there.": 2, "Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.": 2, "I keep hoping this is another vision, that it's not real. But it is, isn't it? We really have lost our home.": 2, "Good. Wipe them out. So long as one of them is left alive, they will come for me!": 2, "I keep gazing into the pommel gem. Not a single flaw.": 2, "I hope you're not expecting a meal. I've barely got enough for them that live here.": 2, "Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.": 2, "That's better. Now we can talk.": 2, "Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.": 2, "Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about.": 2, "Good to see you again, friend.": 2, "That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.": 2, "Good. We should keep moving.": 2, "Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.": 2, "That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.": 2, "Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.": 2, "I hope you're not expecting a thank you.": 2, "I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done.": 2, "That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.": 2, "Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.": 2, "Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.": 2, "Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.": 2, "That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city.": 2, "Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer.": 2, "I hope you're not planning to attack me again...": 2, "Now it is your turn.": 2, "Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.": 2, "That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!": 2, "Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera.": 2, "That's what I was hoping you'd say.": 2, "Now move.": 2, "That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.": 2, "Good, my clients are gettin' impatient.": 2, "Now that guy was nuts.": 2, "You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.": 2, "A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of Aedra in the world?": 2, "Good. I have your invitation to the party.": 2, "A god? Assuredly not! Gods are weak and ineffectual. When was the last time you heard or saw evidence of the Aedra in the world?": 2, "Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.": 2, "I just can't seem to get the hang of making a decent cup of canis root tea.": 2, "Now that that's settled, may we proceed?": 2, "Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.": 2, "Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.": 2, "Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.": 2, "Now that you mention it, there is.": 2, "That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one.": 2, "Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long.": 2, "Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.": 2, "Good. I'm ready for anything.": 2, "Now that was a battle!": 2, "Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared.": 2, "Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going.": 2, "That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.": 2, "That's it. One more time.": 2, "That's it. Now, let's get out of here.": 2, "That's it. Keep hacking at it.": 2, "I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.": 2, "Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm.": 2, "Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur.": 2, "I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case.": 2, "Good. Here's what you need to do.": 2, "Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin.": 2, "Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.": 2, "That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?": 2, "I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try.": 2, "I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker into submission.": 2, "Now that's what I like to hear. Off you go.": 2, "Good, we could use the coin.": 2, "That's right. Turn around and leave.": 2, "Now that's the true Voice!": 2, "Good, you're here.": 2, "That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.": 2, "Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up.": 2, "Now that's just rude.": 2, "Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.": 2, "That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!": 2, "Good. And remember - keep the gods, and they'll keep you.": 2, "Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around.": 2, "That's her! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill her!": 2, "Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this. ": 2, "A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.": 2, "Now tell me where she is!": 2, "Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?": 2, "That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.": 2, "That's quite an opening demand, Tullius.": 2, "That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?": 2, "A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you.": 2, "I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!": 2, "Now that's interesting. Tell me more.": 2, "Good. Don't die out there.": 2, "I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.": 2, "Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me.": 2, "That's him! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill him!": 2, "Not here. Come with me.": 2, "Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary.": 2, "I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn.": 2, "Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.": 2, "Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?": 2, "That's General Tullius himself. He can't stand Elenwen, but she insists that he attend these parties. Just to piss him off, no doubt.": 2, "That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.": 2, "Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.": 2, "That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.": 2, "Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.": 2, "Gods... the pain...": 2, "The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of.": 2, "I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!": 2, "Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?": 2, "Nothing we can do for these ones now. ": 2, "The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout.": 2, "Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?": 2, "The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours.": 2, "The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the souls of the dead!": 2, "Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days.": 2, "Gormlaith the fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.": 2, "Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?": 2, "The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this.": 2, "I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat.": 2, "You've finally become one of us. Come with me. I think it's time I announced my plans to you and your new brothers.": 2, "Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.": 2, "Good day to you.": 2, "Nothing, until you choose to use it.": 2, "That's a good man.": 2, "That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your...": 2, "Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?": 2, "The Dark Brotherhood is dead... and so are you!": 2, "Gods, not again....": 2, "Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.": 2, "The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.": 2, "The Empire to bend its knee before those evil elf bastards? Signing a treaty meant to kill the heart of the Empire itself. To deny Talos? ": 2, "The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.": 2, "The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened.": 2, "Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.": 2, "I hope you weren't expectin' to get paid for this blundered job. Next time, the mark stays alive... you hear me?": 2, "Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them.": 2, "That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one.": 2, "Gods be with you.": 2, "The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side.": 2, "You've got to help me! Please!": 2, "Gods help us!": 2, "Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?": 2, "Got a minute? Wanted to say something.": 2, "The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on.": 2, "The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with.": 2, "The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?": 2, "Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?": 2, "I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.": 2, "Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?": 2, "Nothing else? I'm always eager.": 2, "The Emperor would turn Skyrim into a puppet of the Dominion. I for one would not care to dance for the amusement of those foul elves.": 2, "You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.": 2, "I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again.": 2, "I hope you will find a warmer welcome in your travels than we have found in ours.": 2, "Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.": 2, "Goods and wares of all kinds, and all can be yours!": 2, "The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.": 2, "Now - hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your su'um. Od-ah-viing!": 2, "Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.": 2, "Good luck. I'm counting on you.": 2, "That's all I know, okay?": 2, "Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.": 2, "I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.": 2, "That's all I know.": 2, "Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.": 2, "Good luck. You're on your own now.": 2, "The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.": 2, "The Argonians at the docks say they can breathe underwater. I wish I could do that...": 2, "Now get out of here and to the outpost! I need to know what's happening out there.": 2, "I knew he was telling the truth. I always can tell.": 2, "Now get out!": 2, "Good... here's your assignment.": 2, "Good observation. What else?": 2, "Good on you.": 2, "I knew I could trust you!": 2, "The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.": 2, "Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company.": 2, "I knew I could count on you, soldier.": 2, "Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.": 2, "Good riddance.": 2, "I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.": 2, "Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us.": 2, "I hope you're here for friendlier reasons now... after all, I'm all paid up.": 2, "Good that you're so eager.": 2, "I killed Torygg to prove our wretched condition. How is the High King supposed to be the defender of Skyrim, if he can't even defend himself?": 2, "I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.": 2, "Now don't get cross with me, but the officials are demanding compensation for the mark you killed. Had to do it... had no choice, boss.": 2, "Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!": 2, "Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them...": 2, "Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.": 2, "I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly.": 2, "Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.": 2, "Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!": 2, "Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.": 2, "Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?": 2, "Good hunting. ": 2, "Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.": 2, "Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.": 2, "Good idea. Let me know when you're ready.": 2, "Now we end this!": 2, "The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to.": 2, "Goodness!": 2, "Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.": 2, "<humming>": 2, "Good job. Now here's your part of the deal.": 2, "A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place.": 2, "That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.": 2, "Now I've got to clean up this mess.": 2, "Good luck finding the fragments.": 2, "Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry. Frea will guide us well, thanks to you.": 2, "The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.": 2, "The Bloodmoon lights the way.": 2, "Good luck on your next job.": 2, "The Blades knew, once upon a time. Alduin's Wall is the key. Yes, yes!": 2, "Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.": 2, "That's absurd. Come on now.": 2, "Goodbye, dear.": 2, "Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work.": 2, "The wise hunter is cautious, always.": 2, "Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment.": 2, "The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!": 2, "I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.": 2, "Now, stand aside, there's work to be done.": 2, "That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.": 2, "The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.": 2, "That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble.": 2, "I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.": 2, "I need your help with something. Something private.": 2, "The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.": 2, "The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though.": 2, "I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard.": 2, "I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.": 2, "I need you to retrieve the poem.": 2, "The path is closed, till your courage is tested.": 2, "No. However, I know someone who might.": 2, "The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough.": 2, "I heard you fought a dragon. That must have been terrifying.": 2, "I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.": 2, "The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?": 2, "The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?": 2, "The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?": 2, "No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask.": 2, "The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...": 2, "For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.": 2, "The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.": 2, "For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best.": 2, "For now, give the papers to my Steward.": 2, "That attitude would get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool.": 2, "For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own.": 2, "The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive. ": 2, "No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim.": 2, "For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.": 2, "A Light that could illuminate Skyrim and her people.": 2, "Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason.": 2, "The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?": 2, "The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward.": 2, "The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.": 2, "I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.": 2, "The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice.": 2, "No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days.": 2, "The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.": 2, "I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.": 2, "The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.": 2, "The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage.": 2, "The rebellion is over. Ulfric Stormcloak is dead. ": 2, "For Dawnstar!": 2, "For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.": 2, "I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck.": 2, "I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.": 2, "No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything...": 2, "The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.": 2, "For Lady Mara!": 2, "I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him.": 2, "No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that.": 2, "The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop Alduin.": 2, "No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well.": 2, "..wha?... where?... D-destroy this place! Tear it apart!": 2, "Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.": 2, "The presence of the living is near...": 2, "For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?": 2, "The ritual is complete.": 2, "For now, looking after Joric is my job.": 2, "The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.": 2, "No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.": 2, "For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.": 2, "The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary. ": 2, "The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something.": 2, "For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs.": 2, "I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.": 2, "No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood.": 2, "No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom.": 2, "I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.": 2, "The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.": 2, "No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.": 2, "I need to get my things and say goodbye to everyone. I'll meet you at home. Thanks! Thanks so much!": 2, "The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this.": 2, "The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.": 2, "No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call \"The Miasma,\" putting everyone to sleep.": 2, "I need to get back to the village. My father will have need of me.": 2, "For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at.": 2, "For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin.": 2, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!": 2, "For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.": 2, "The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.": 2, "That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.": 2, "The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.": 2, "No. Not again. Help!": 2, "For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us.": 2, "I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. ": 2, "No. Not yet.": 2, "The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.": 2, "I heard you paid my debt to Mogrul. I don't know how I can every repay you.": 2, "I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple.": 2, "For the glory of the Empire.": 2, "For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know.": 2, "The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.": 2, "For once you'll actually pay for your crimes.": 2, "I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her \"cooperation.\"": 2, "The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.": 2, "That big tree in the park looks so sad... I feel sorry for it.": 2, "The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.": 2, "The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.": 2, "The only unusual thing is the shape of the cuts.": 2, "You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.": 2, "The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.": 2, "Now, on to other things.": 2, "The only thing that matters to me is keeping my wife safe. I won't let anyone harm her.": 2, "The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.": 2, "For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play.": 2, "The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.": 2, "The only thing Madanach expects is a bottle of Skooma in tribute every so often. You're not getting through.": 2, "No. I will have no part of any such Empire. And I will gladly gut anyone who says otherwise.": 2, "I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone.": 2, "I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.": 2, "The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment.": 2, "The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.": 2, "For the fallen...": 2, "The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.": 2, "The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste.": 2, "I need to tell Master Neloth about that Ash Guardian, but I don't dare leave my home.": 2, "That can't be done.": 2, "For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose.": 2, "The road makes this one weary.": 2, "The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.": 2, "Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.": 2, "Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with?": 2, "I presume the same thing you're doing... leaving an offering for the departed.": 2, "I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.": 2, "I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.": 2, "Thanks for bringing the claw back.": 2, "Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.": 2, "A little girl is dead because of me.": 2, "No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.": 2, "No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!": 2, "No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid.": 2, "Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use.": 2, "The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right.": 2, "You've breathed your last breath, mortal!": 2, "The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.": 2, "I played with Lucia in the park today. I feel sorry for her.": 2, "You've breathed your last!": 2, "The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.": 2, "The time for talk has passed. We must hurry.": 2, "Ha! We'll see about that!": 2, "The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.": 2, "The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.": 2, "I hear you have spirit. This is good. You may yet join our numbers.": 2, "First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that.": 2, "Thanks for the business.": 2, "The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.": 2, "First we'll kick the Thalmor and their bloody Imperial puppets out of the country. Then we'll rebuild Skyrim into the land she once was.": 2, "Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.": 2, "The walls have ears and you're being tested, lad. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.": 2, "The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?": 2, "The walls have ears and you're being tested, lass. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.": 2, "The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and to the people... but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation.": 2, "The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.": 2, "No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink.": 2, "Fine. Don't tell me. But I know that look in your eyes. Someone who's faced death at the hands of the law.": 2, "A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn.": 2, "The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.  ": 2, "Fine. Here's everything you need to know.": 2, "Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open.": 2, "No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!": 2, "Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.": 2, "I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets.": 2, "Nuhn!": 2, "Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.": 2, "The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway.": 2, "Nuh...": 2, "Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!": 2, "I promise to join you there as soon as I can.": 2, "I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.": 2, "You've little time to glory in your accomplishments.": 2, "Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.": 2, "Fine. Let's get this over with.": 2, "The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.": 2, "Fine. Let's go.": 2, "You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.": 2, "The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay.": 2, "Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning.": 2, "Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!": 2, "The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies.": 2, "The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.": 2, "First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind.": 2, "Thanks for the warning.": 2, "A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died.": 2, "Thanks, ma!": 2, "The shadows have failed you!": 2, "The shadows have betrayed you!": 2, "No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us.": 2, "Thanks, pa!": 2, "No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem.": 2, "Now, where was I...": 2, "No, no. You're not understanding this.": 2, "Follow me, it's this way.": 2, "No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now.": 2, "I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here.": 2, "Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.": 2, "Thanks. I guess.": 2, "You're going to get it, Sissel!": 2, "Follow the road east from Falkreath, then north at the crossroads. Turn left just past Pinewatch.": 2, "The screams... they pierce my mind. I can't stand it!": 2, "The scent of victory is on the wind.": 2, "You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum.": 2, "Thanks. Thanks... for everything, Ma.": 2, "Thanks. Thanks... for everything, Pa.": 2, "I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara.": 2, "I no longer hunger, grow weary or feel anything but loneliness.": 2, "I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you.": 2, "Fool! He is perverting my Light. ": 2, "The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know.": 2, "The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.": 2, "The roads of Skyrim can be treacherous. If you must walk them, be wary.": 2, "Focus on the mission.": 2, "Now, while I'm certain this is all terribly interesting to you, I have important matters to attend.": 2, "You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!": 2, "Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees. ": 2, "The sun's gone dark. What could be happening now?": 2, "The sun is gone! We're all doomed!": 2, "First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready.": 2, "First, an incantation to remove the barrier.": 2, "The streets of Windhelm are now safe. ": 2, "First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse.": 2, "First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.": 2, "First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time.": 2, "The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.": 2, "First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above.": 2, "The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.": 2, "I owe you that much.": 2, "I owe you some answers, don't I?": 2, "100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?": 2, "Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons.": 2, "First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp.": 2, "The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing.": 2, "Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.": 2, "Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!": 2, "Five, four, three, two, one... go!": 2, "The sooner we can get out of this filth-pit, the better.": 2, "I heard Mogrul is dead. That is a relief!": 2, "The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.": 2, "The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?": 2, "I oppose tyranny. I oppose those who tell me how to live, what to think, and what to believe.": 2, "You've come a long way. I don't think we could do without you. I'm hereby raising you to Tribune. Congratulations.": 2, "Now, you go about your business.": 2, "No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside.": 2, "The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.": 2, "That damn fool! I should ring her neck!": 2, "No. Of course not. Just - don't let me down Cipius. ": 2, "That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.": 2, "General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests.": 2, "Not a failure, my servant.": 2, "That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.": 2, "Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over.": 2, "The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see. ": 2, "Not actually a Companion myself, but none of them know how to work a forge properly, and I'm honored to serve them.": 2, "Greetings, fellow hunter.": 2, "That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from.": 2, "Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway.": 2, "I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...": 2, "Your chief Talos-hunter?": 2, "I make it. I drink it. I share it with friends. Ha!": 2, "Not at all. I consider it a blessing.": 2, "Get away from me.": 2, "You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.": 2, "Get away!": 2, "Greetings, Shield-Sister.": 2, "The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated.": 2, "The courier must have found you.": 2, "I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!": 2, "Greetings, Shield-Brother.": 2, "Now, I really got to get back to the body. Lot of work to prepare her for the grave.": 2, "Get going.": 2, "The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.": 2, "A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed.": 2, "The clouds, the sky... it's all wrong. Everything's wrong.": 2, "Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there.": 2, "General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce!": 2, "Get it away from me. Get it away!": 2, "The defiler waxes! ": 2, "General Tullius.": 2, "The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight.": 2, "Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an \"...unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.\"": 2, "Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.": 2, "Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.": 2, "I hope so.": 2, "The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.": 2, "Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?": 2, "Now, as for your wish... Power, was it?": 2, "Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it?": 2, "Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen.": 2, "The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.": 2, "I mean it! I'll... I'll cut you in half!": 2, "Gee up, there!": 2, "Gee up, there.": 2, "The dwarves were very clever, tapping into and drawing power from the Heart of Lorkhan itself.": 2, "The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.": 2, "That makes Twenty-Three. ": 2, "That makes sense.": 2, "Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her!": 2, "I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine.": 2, "General Tullius expects much of me, and thus I expect much of my men.": 2, "Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.": 2, "The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.": 2, "A few septims for my supper is all I ask.": 2, "Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did.": 2, "I may fall to your malice, but your fate is already written.": 2, "I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.": 2, "General Tullius...": 2, "That must be the Voice!": 2, "Great. What do you want to do?": 2, "The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!": 2, "You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly.": 2, "Get over there and see what you can do.": 2, "Get over to Dawnstar.": 2, "Get over to Dawnstar. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to Falkreath.": 2, "Get over to Falkreath. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired. ": 2, "Get over to Markarth.": 2, "The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught.": 2, "Get over to Markarth. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to Morthal.": 2, "Get over to Morthal. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to Riften.": 2, "Get over to Riften. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to Whiterun.": 2, "Get over to Whiterun. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us.": 2, "Get over to Windhelm. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to Winterhold.": 2, "Get over to Winterhold. We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to our camp in Hjaalmarch. We need to strengthen our defensive position.": 2, "Get over to our camp in the Pale. It's time we bring them back into the fold.": 2, "Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can muster.": 2, "The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.": 2, "Get over to the capital! We're mounting our final attack!": 2, "Get over to the capital.": 2, "The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.": 2, "That remains to be seen.": 2, "Get out while you can.": 2, "The bloodiest beef in the Reach.": 2, "That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.": 2, "Get it wrong, and... well. You've seen what happened when I tried it.": 2, "A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.": 2, "Get me down. Get me down!": 2, "Not bad. Now turn me back.": 2, "The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding.": 2, "Great. Watch yourself out there, boss.": 2, "The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name.": 2, "Get moving.": 2, "The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.": 2, "I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive.": 2, "Great. There's so much history here in Windhelm, so much to learn about our ancestors and our land.": 2, "Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened.": 2, "Not enough to outweigh the loss of Riften. The whole south of Eastmarch would be open to Imperial attack.": 2, "Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.": 2, "Not entirely true, though not entirely false either.": 2, "You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides.": 2, "Get out of here before I call the guards!": 2, "Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast.": 2, "I love it when a plan comes together.": 2, "That one's far nicer though... almost ceremonial.": 2, "You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.": 2, "Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies.": 2, "Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.": 2, "I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.": 2, "Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.": 2, "That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.": 2, "That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.": 2, "You've done exactly as I predicted and brought your fetching companion to me.": 2, "I hope that you will come to do business with us again.": 2, "I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact.": 2, "Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.": 2, "The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!": 2, "No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!": 2, "You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.": 2, "The love of the land and her people flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your hands.": 2, "The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.": 2, "Fortune smiles upon this meeting.": 2, "The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems.": 2, "The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!": 2, "Guards! Trespasser!": 2, "Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business.": 2, "No.... Not again!": 2, "Guards! Forsworn!": 2, "The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.": 2, "No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?": 2, "I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.": 2, "Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you.": 2, "Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal.": 2, "Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.": 2, "Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you. ": 2, "I hope I didn't scare you.": 2, "The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you want to earn your share.": 2, "Nobody else would even know which end to hold. ": 2, "Frea... I'm sorry.": 2, "Frea... what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was safe now.": 2, "The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.": 2, "The last few pages seem to describe \"the failure of the Nightingales\" although it doesn't go into great detail.": 2, "Nobody here anymore.": 2, "The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.": 2, "The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.": 2, "The land is on the coast, across the Karth delta from Solitude. An inspiring location, as you'll see.": 2, "No... not when we're so close...": 2, "I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.": 2, "That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.": 2, "That didn't take long.": 2, "Forgive me if I don't appear relieved... this temple has taken its toll on me.": 2, "I hold you responsible for this situation. So, you better win me back Riften, or die trying.": 2, "No. There are too many people around. Come with me.": 2, "Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.": 2, "I need another drink.": 2, "I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.": 2, "Forgive me, my brother.": 2, "Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.": 2, "The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.": 2, "That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.": 2, "I must return to the frontline Alessian headquarters at once... lives are hanging in the balance!": 2, "No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation?": 2, "The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?": 2, "That everything?": 2, "Now, let's just pretend this never happened.": 2, "The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold.": 2, "I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.": 2, "The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.": 2, "The measure of a man is taken at the moment of his death. And know this for truth, the ghosts of many heroes walk among us.": 2, "No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...": 2, "The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?": 2, "I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.": 2, "The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree.": 2, "The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.": 2, "The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?": 2, "I must have imagined it.": 2, "The land is near Giants' Gap, right on the border with Whiterun Hold. You'll almost be in sight of the Loreius Farm, in fact.": 2, "The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.": 2, "The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.": 2, "I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.": 2, "I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.": 2, "That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend. ": 2, "Grimvar said a boy used to live in that abandoned house, all alone, 'til the Dark Brotherhood came 'n got him. Scary, huh?": 2, "I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.": 2, "Now, he's not exactly goin' to welcome you with open arms, but keep your cool. Do this job right and we've just made an important friend out there.": 2, "The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.": 2, "A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of...": 2, "That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.": 2, "The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.": 2, "Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded.": 2, "The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality.": 2, "I hope not. This is an important job.": 2, "You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?": 2, "The games have ended, time to face your death!": 2, "That is who we are. The Forsworn. Criminals in our own lands. And we will cut a bloody hole into the Reach until we are free.": 2, "Gaaaaah!!!": 2, "Gaaaah!": 2, "Noooo...": 2, "The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.": 2, "The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.": 2, "That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours.": 2, "The first thing we need to do is figure out who's behind the dragons.": 2, "Gah! Let's get on with it already!": 2, "Noooooo!!!": 2, "You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.": 2, "The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.": 2, "Grr...": 2, "The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.": 2, "The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.": 2, "I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me.": 2, "Nobody pilfers property on my watch.": 2, "Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there.": 2, "Nobody we know, by the smell. ": 2, "I miss the warm sunshine. Green grass. Blue skies. I miss being alive.": 2, "Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!": 2, "The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.": 2, "The joy of battle burns in your heart!": 2, "Freshly killed. Whoever did this is still close... and will suffer for their insolence.": 2, "I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.": 2, "Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild.": 2, "The intruder has vanished.": 2, "Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!": 2, "The inns at Dragonbridge and Solitude are frequent stops for Imperial runners.": 2, "I mean, someone who's not me, that is. ": 2, "The inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.": 2, "The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold.": 2, "Nocturnal, save me...": 2, "None can stand against the Wolf Queen!": 2, "That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination.": 2, "I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now.": 2, "From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair.": 2, "None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.": 2, "That is none of your concern.": 2, "The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.": 2, "From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here. ": 2, "Grrah!": 2, "Grragh!": 2, "From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.": 2, "The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend.": 2, "Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!": 2, "Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is.": 2, "Please, I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.": 2, "Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make, anyway.": 2, "Wait... that almost makes sense!": 2, "He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.": 2, "Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.": 2, "Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?": 2, "Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's Jarl.": 2, "Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is.": 2, "Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.": 2, "Do I? And what about you? What right did you have to meddle in my affairs? Kill my people? Was it worth it? Your truth?": 2, "He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.": 2, "Sound like you can handle it?": 2, "Wake up!": 2, "Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it.": 2, "Truly?": 2, "He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from.": 2, "Do colors seem brighter to you? Everything seems bigger, too. Strange...": 2, "Sounds good. Be careful.": 2, "Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut.": 2, "Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.": 2, "Mister Brynjolf said he could teach me a lot of neat things when I'm older.": 2, "Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.": 2, "Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!": 2, "Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.": 2, "A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say.": 2, "Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?": 2, "Maven sent word that you discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?": 2, "Divines smile on you, friend.": 2, "He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.": 2, "Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was.": 2, "Do I get to keep it? Just kidding.": 2, "Maven sends her regards Letrush.": 2, "Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way.": 2, "I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you.": 2, "He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.": 2, "Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery.": 2, "Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.": 2, "Mister Brynjolf gave me an apple, Papa! He seems nice.": 2, "I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.": 2, "He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.": 2, "Mmm hmm. Anything else?": 2, "Coward.": 2, "Couldn't be better. Whiterun is perfect for a child- great weather, plenty of space, friends to play with. What more could you want?": 2, "I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.": 2, "I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....": 2, "Couldn't ask for better weather.": 2, "Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed.": 2, "Money, if that is what you wish.": 2, "Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him.": 2, "Still, I've got this axe, and even if I can't use it, I'm sure someone would make a deal for it. Maybe I'll have a word with Molag Bal...": 2, "Do not fail Kodlak. He's earned his place here, and does not deserve to fall prey to Alduin's insatiable hunger.": 2, "I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.": 2, "Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.": 2, "Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.": 2, "Want to come along?": 2, "I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes.": 2, "I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.": 2, "He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out.": 2, "Want my advice? Never welch on a bargain with the Ideal Masters... they don't take it very well.": 2, "Couldn't have done it better myself. Here's your coin.": 2, "Sorry. Margret might be dead, but the room's rented.": 2, "Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.": 2, "True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.": 2, "True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions.": 2, "Still something you'd like me to do?": 2, "Court is in session.": 2, "Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.": 2, "True, he didn't stand a chance against me.": 2, "Oh, gods...": 2, "He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?": 2, "Mmmhmm.": 2, "Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?": 2, "Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.": 2, "Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice.": 2, "I was astounded and in turn it lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?": 2, "Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.": 2, "Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?": 2, "Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.": 2, "Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?": 2, "I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.": 2, "Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.": 2, "I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.": 2, "Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.": 2, "Spare me, please!": 2, "Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.": 2, "Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool of my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that.": 2, "Dah...": 2, "Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.": 2, "Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.": 2, "Waaaah!": 2, "Turn back, traveler! Terror waits within this mist.": 2, "Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing.": 2, "I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.": 2, "Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?": 2, "Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass.": 2, "I feel like I can beat anyone.": 2, "Miraak was a formidable opponent. I wonder what he would have been like as my apprentice.": 2, "Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.": 2, "I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.": 2, "I got nothing to say to you.": 2, "Damn Akaviri Shaman... how could I know it would trap my soul?": 2, "Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not.": 2, "I wonder if the fires are still burning in the Imperial City...": 2, "Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshalled there.": 2, "Die, foul orc!": 2, "Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?": 2, "Damn dustmen!": 2, "He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.": 2, "Damn dragon!": 2, "He's outlived his minor usefulness. Take care of him, and then we can leave Cidhna Mine for good. ": 2, "Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple...": 2, "Speak quickly.": 2, "I wonder if a dragon could be captured alive? It would make a fascinating test subject.": 2, "Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.": 2, "He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother.": 2, "I wonder if my family misses me? I wonder if they're still alive. How much time has passed?": 2, "He's probably hoping I'll refuse so he can blame the Empire for being unreasonable. I think I'll have to disappoint him yet again.": 2, "Damn Imperial arrogance!": 2, "I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves.": 2, "Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that.": 2, "Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed your oath to the Emperor at every turn.": 2, "Wait a moment... do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief?": 2, "Wait a moment... what's that?": 2, "He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him.": 2, "Wait, come back!": 2, "Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!": 2, "Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.": 2, "Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.": 2, "Try not to die.": 2, "I was hoping you'd say that.": 2, "Try it again. Breath and focus.": 2, "Try as you may, they won't say \"good day,\" but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!": 2, "I got you a present, Ma! I hope you like it!": 2, "I wonder what keeps these machines working so long after their masters disappeared.": 2, "Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.": 2, "I got you a present, Mama! I hope you like it!": 2, "Sovngarde take your soul. I'll avenge your body.": 2, "I wonder what they were mining down here.": 2, "He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia... I was devastated when he was killed.": 2, "Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.": 2, "I got you a present, Papa! I hope you like it!": 2, "Wait, before you go...": 2, "Could you please leave now?": 2, "May Auri-El's brilliance illuminate your path.": 2, "Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest...": 2, "Wait a second, there's another option here.": 2, "Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.": 2, "I feel a change in the room...": 2, "May Hircine guide our blades.": 2, "Disappointing.": 2, "Try putting your hands on the altar. Maybe Mehrunes Dagon will speak to you.": 2, "Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been.": 2, "Oh, don't worry too much about it. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it.": 2, "He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question.": 2, "Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.": 2, "May Auri-El's warmth imbue your body with strength.": 2, "Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!": 2, "Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class.": 2, "May Auri-El's radiance fill your heart with joy.": 2, "Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us.": 2, "Try not to get carried away.": 2, "May Auri-El's light guide you in your darkest hours.": 2, "May Auri-El's glow shield you from your enemy.": 2, "Want to play a game?": 2, "Want to talk? Go ahead.": 2, "Wanted to say something to you.": 2, "Consider it forgotten, boss.": 2, "Today you die, your doom has come.": 2, "Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.": 2, "Stop the intruder!": 2, "A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment.": 2, "Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them.": 2, "Do you have it?": 2, "Stop that! Keep your spells to yourself.": 2, "Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.": 2, "Do you have news of our quarry?": 2, "Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.": 2, "Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that. ": 2, "I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.": 2, "Watch yourself out there.": 2, "Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.": 2, "Hear me!": 2, "Congratulations.": 2, "Do you have any orders?": 2, "Most impressive, mortal... most impressive.": 2, "Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out.": 2, "Master Borri will teach you \"Kest\" - \"Tempest\"- the third word of Whirlwind Sprint.": 2, "Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense.": 2, "Master Borri is waiting.": 2, "Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.": 2, "Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.": 2, "I warned you not to cross Maven. If I hadn't stepped in and paid amends, you'd be... well, I think you know.": 2, "He revels in the chase, and also gave the \"gift\" of lycanthropy to mortals.": 2, "Do you feel that?": 2, "Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.": 2, "Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to...": 2, "Do you have Gallus's Journal?": 2, "Stop that!": 2, "Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds.": 2, "Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?": 2, "Watch where you're going.": 2, "Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever.": 2, "Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me?": 2, "Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps.": 2, "Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?": 2, "Watch yourself.": 2, "Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?": 2, "Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was \"after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.\"": 2, "Come... embrace your death!": 2, "Come. You, too. We can escape through the tunnels.": 2, "Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.": 2, "I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.": 2, "Stop, thief!": 2, "Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.": 2, "We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.": 2, "Hear, hear!": 2, "Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?": 2, "We all have faith in you.": 2, "Come, we will do your next test inside the hall.": 2, "Come, we must get to the Skull and destroy it.": 2, "We all wait upon you, Dragonborn.": 2, "Maramal said I could visit the temple whenever I wanted.": 2, "Stormblade!": 2, "To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf.": 2, "We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's.": 2, "Master Borri will teach you \"Nah\" - \"Fury\" - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint.": 2, "Margret!": 2, "Stop! That's priceless!": 2, "I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high. ": 2, "Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild.": 2, "Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?": 2, "I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.": 2, "To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. I say she walks or we walk.": 2, "Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.": 2, "Command me, my Listener.": 2, "To think that I would sit down at the same table with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.": 2, "I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?": 2, "Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?": 2, "Coming right up.": 2, "Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to...": 2, "Sorry, boss. Had to use your share to cover expenses after you done and got messy.": 2, "A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!": 2, "Most of the game has been driven north by the ashfall.": 2, "I would... eh... be interested in acquiring it. If you're willing to part with it, that is.": 2, "I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.": 2, "I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.": 2, "Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?": 2, "Master Borri will teach you \"Wuld,\" which means \"Whirlwind.\"": 2, "Master Borri.": 2, "Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!": 2, "Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.": 2, "Do the men you killed haunt you? Mine do...": 2, "I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.": 2, "Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.": 2, "Do they know where he is?": 2, "Master Neloth was furious when the tower withered. It just seemed to happen overnight.": 2, "Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?": 2, "Could I... could I keep him? Please?": 2, "Could I keep him? Please?": 2, "Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.": 2, "Could I get a few gold to spend? Please?": 2, "Oh, good, more of those.": 2, "Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will waste in obscurity.": 2, "Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.": 2, "Was something we discussed unclear?": 2, "I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.": 2, "Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun.": 2, "I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.": 2, "Warriors in the wild, living like the Nords of old.": 2, "More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild.": 2, "Could you give me an allowance?": 2, "Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle.": 2, "War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that. ": 2, "Sorry, was only joking with you.": 2, "Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive.": 2, "I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.": 2, "Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of \"Dah.\"": 2, "I guess I was wrong.": 2, "Do not try to hide from me.": 2, "Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn.": 2, "More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.": 2, "Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?": 2, "I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger.": 2, "Traitors. Traitors all of you!": 2, "Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? ": 2, "Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.": 2, "Was that really necessary?": 2, "Was that some sort of... healing spell?": 2, "Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.": 2, "Was there anything else she told you?": 2, "Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun.": 2, "Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.": 2, "Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?": 2, "Control yourself! Do not frighten away our customers with your fits.": 2, "Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?": 2, "Master Neloth certainly keeps me busy. Taking care of this estate is a lot of work.": 2, "Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?": 2, "Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.": 2, "I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries.": 2, "Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust.": 2, "Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.": 2, "Master Einarth will now teach you \"Ro,\" the second Word in Unrelenting Force.": 2, "Master Einarth is waiting.": 2, "Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to take care of business.": 2, "I fear for what this change will do to my family.": 2, "Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace.": 2, "Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?": 2, "Too lazy to give him a drink yourself? Oaf.": 2, "Master Borri will teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.": 2, "Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.": 2, "Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life.": 2, "Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?": 2, "Was there anything else?": 2, "Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.": 2, "Do this, and I shall favor you.": 2, "Do try not to set off any traps, will you?": 2, "Do vah kiin!": 2, "Sorry, no houses for sale in Dawnstar right now. But... I could sell you land in the hold where you could build your own house.": 2, "I would hope that's obvious.": 2, "Tools, wares and weapons, all for sale at fair prices.": 2, "Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that.": 2, "I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form.": 2, "Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for. ": 2, "Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions. ": 2, "Oh, Beem...": 2, "Too much... can't...": 2, "Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.": 2, "Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away.": 2, "Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them.": 2, "Steal anything worth talking about?": 2, "Die, World-Eater, in despair and fear!": 2, "Mind yourself.": 2, "Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine.": 2, "Stay out of my way, boot.": 2, "Defeating Miraak was an impressive feat. I'm curious to see if Hermaeus Mora seeks you out because of it.": 2, "Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.": 2, "I will shadow your steps.": 2, "Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there.": 2, "I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here.": 2, "Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!": 2, "Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways.": 2, "Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!": 2, "Um... hey, Pa! Welcome home!": 2, "Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.": 2, "Did you know I visited Elswyr once? What a strange and wondrous place.": 2, "Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf.": 2, "Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?": 2, "Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts.": 2, "Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!": 2, "I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.": 2, "Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.": 2, "Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing.": 2, "Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!": 2, "Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!": 2, "Use Dragonrend, brothers! Bring him to swords-reach!": 2, "Men who understand each other often have no need for words.": 2, "Men who understand one another need not waste words.": 2, "Use Dragonrend, to drag him down!": 2, "Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?": 2, "Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful.": 2, "Use both words, if you can.": 2, "Use everything we have!": 2, "Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms.": 2, "I went fishing at the lake. I almost caught something!": 2, "I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.": 2, "Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.": 2, "Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!": 2, "A new supplicant approaches.": 2, "Did you hear that?": 2, "Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.": 2, "Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny.": 2, "Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to.": 2, "Vaermina forgive me...": 2, "Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.": 2, "Maybe this is a way out?": 2, "Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.": 2, "I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you \"explained\" it to him. Well done!": 2, "Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.": 2, "Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.": 2, "Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.": 2, "Mercer's here. I can feel it.": 2, "Oh, be certain to purchase my Falmer translation tome when it's completed!": 2, "Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.": 2, "I figured you had it in you. Nicely done.": 2, "I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open.": 2, "Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice.": 2, "He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.": 2, "Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.": 2, "Ulfric will know my meaning.": 2, "Maybe so, but we shouldn't be making concessions before negotiations even start. Makes us look weak.": 2, "Mercer's been here, I hope we aren't too late.": 2, "He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.": 2, "Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion.": 2, "Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons.": 2, "Um, hey, Ma! Welcome home!": 2, "Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.": 2, "He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find.": 2, "Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person.": 2, "Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.": 2, "I wasn't sure you'd come back for me. I'm still looking for a guide to get me home. What do you say?": 2, "I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back.": 2, "Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away.": 2, "Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you.": 2, "Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.": 2, "Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...": 2, "Did you learn anything useful?": 2, "Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.": 2, "Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.": 2, "Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table.": 2, "Death is but a door, time is but a window. I'll be back.": 2, "He's been digging around the records the Blades left here, too. But we can talk about that later.": 2, "I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.": 2, "Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. We need to show Tullius we won't be pushed around.": 2, "I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open.": 2, "Did you get me a present?": 2, "I will look for a spot to land.": 2, "Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear.": 2, "Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.": 2, "Maybe.": 2, "Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress.": 2, "Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon.": 2, "Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.": 2, "Unnnhhhh...": 2, "Did Ri'saad accept our offer?": 2, "Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do.": 2, "Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes.": 2, "I fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. I bled and spilt blood for the Empire. And for what?": 2, "Did he now? I can only hope.": 2, "Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that.": 2, "Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe she found what she was looking for in there.": 2, "Unfortunately, yes.": 2, "Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy...": 2, "Destroy the intruder!": 2, "Unnff...": 2, "Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!": 2, "I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.": 2, "I found something for you. It... sounds like things have been bad lately, so... I hope this cheers you up.": 2, "Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal.": 2, "Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.": 2, "I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...": 2, "Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away.": 2, "Unlike your Imperial friends here.": 2, "Start at the beginning, as usual.": 2, "Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought. ": 2, "Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you.": 2, "Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.": 2, "Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.": 2, "He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.": 2, "Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?": 2, "Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.": 2, "Stand in the center of the circle.": 2, "Unless you have more Stalhrim weapons and armor for me, we have nothing to talk about.": 2, "Until our next meeting, if such is fated.": 2, "Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter.": 2, "Meat and mead must ever make way for the clash of steel - the song of battle.": 2, "Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe he found what he was looking for in there.": 2, "Meet us here when you're ready. ": 2, "Stay back!": 2, "Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again!": 2, "Stay back, lord!": 2, "He'll answer any questions you have.": 2, "Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you.": 2, "Delphine? How do you... so you've finally found her, and she led you to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap.": 2, "Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!": 2, "Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges.": 2, "Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood.": 2, "Stay close and in plain view. No funny business unless you want a few inches of steel in your belly.": 2, "Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.": 2, "Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?": 2, "Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?": 2, "Delphine really is alive, then? You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you want.": 2, "Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?": 2, "Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras.": 2, "Did you call me?": 2, "Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.": 2, "Did you bring me anything?": 2, "Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's.": 2, "Meat from fresh kills.": 2, "Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants.": 2, "I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago.": 2, "Stay away from the Oblivion Gate I told them. Did they listen? Of course not.": 2, "I will conquer where Alduin failed.": 2, "Stay away from the crystals or you may find yourself becoming one of us.": 2, "He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.": 2, "Stand aside!": 2, "Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?": 2, "Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long.": 2, "I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works. ": 2, "I will be back at your house if you need me, Thane.": 2, "Until then, we have quite the task ahead.": 2, "Maybe you'd like a taste?": 2, "Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?": 2, "Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.": 2, "Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him.": 2, "Untold numbers of Nords died defending the Empire against the Dominion. And for what?": 2, "Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.": 2, "Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around.": 2, "Veren... Thorek... you're alive!": 2, "Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.": 2, "Ugh... damn thing.": 2, "May the sun warm your path, friend.": 2, "Very well. You may enter.": 2, "Speak with Gunmar. He has something for you.": 2, "Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.": 2, "I was starting to think you might never come back.": 2, "Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.": 2, "Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.": 2, "Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.": 2, "Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.": 2, "May the sun keep you warm even in this land of bitter cold.": 2, "Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.": 2, "Steady now!": 2, "Mind your manners in this hall, friend.": 2, "Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.": 2, "Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.": 2, "Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you.": 2, "Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.": 2, "I won't bend. Never!": 2, "Damn right.": 2, "I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is.": 2, "Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?": 2, "Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed Skyrim at every turn.": 2, "Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.": 2, "Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand?": 2, "Did you want something?": 2, "Stay where I can see you.": 2, "Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.": 2, "I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.": 2, "Damn right we do.": 2, "Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra.": 2, "He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge.": 2, "He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country.": 2, "Speak with Isran. He has something for you.": 2, "Stay your hand, warrior!": 2, "Very well. Just be careful!": 2, "Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.": 2, "Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her.": 2, "Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.": 2, "Mind your step. I think I spied a patch of ice on the floor.": 2, "Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.": 2, "Vilkas, take her out to the yard and see what she can do.": 2, "Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.": 2, "I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?": 2, "Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.": 2, "Die! For the love of the gods, die!": 2, "Mind yourself with that fire. Don't burn anything down, now.": 2, "Speak to me, Shield-Sister.": 2, "Speak to me, Shield-Brother.": 2, "Damn it, I lost him!  Protect the Jarl!": 2, "Damn it, I lost her! Protect the Jarl!": 2, "Damn it! There's no way through.": 2, "Speak to Styrr. He can help.": 2, "May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life.": 2, "Oh, did you need something?": 2, "Die, N'wah!": 2, "I wonder how many of us think we'll be the lucky ones and survive this?": 2, "Vilkas will see if you're worth our trouble.": 2, "I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business.": 2, "I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof.": 2, "Vile! None of that - you made a deal, and the mortal stood by it honestly. Now it's your turn to come through.": 2, "I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.": 2, "Steady, old girl.": 2, "May the strength and truth of your Voice serve you well. Breath and focus.": 2, "Ugh, this place... horrible.": 2, "May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...": 2, "I won't do it. You ask too much.": 2, "I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything.": 2, "Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.": 2, "May the light of certitude guide your efforts.": 2, "Victory for Nocturnal!": 2, "Speak with Florentius. He has something for you.": 2, "Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!": 2, "Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls. Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?": 2, "A new hand touches the beacon.": 2, "I won't let you hurt Alva!": 2, "Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay.": 2, "Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?": 2, "May the gods keep you.": 2, "Maybe so, but I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak.": 2, "Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man.": 2, "Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.": 2, "Mercy!": 2, "Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people.": 2, "Did you really build this house all by yourself? Wow!": 2, "Did you really come here expecting to claim Auriel's Bow?": 2, "Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.": 2, "Did you really see a dragon?": 2, "Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you.": 2, "He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.": 2, "Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious.": 2, "Damnit. Where'd they get catapults? The city walls are already falling apart as it is.": 2, "Damnit. What's he waiting for?": 2, "He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.": 2, "Damnit! This isn't about gold!": 2, "Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.": 2, "I wish more had the dedication and strength of character that you demonstrate. I'll be sure this gets put to good use.": 2, "Maybe I'll see you around the Guild.": 2, "Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim.": 2, "Darkness destroy you!": 2, "Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...": 2, "Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!": 2, "Maybe one of the guards had a key?": 2, "Maybe one day, just not today.": 2, "Dead! Someone's going to pay for this.": 2, "I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence.": 2, "Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.": 2, "You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed.": 2, "Did you need anything else?": 2, "He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dump it into the brewing vat.": 2, "Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal.": 2, "A peaceful greeting to you.": 2, "Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people.": 2, "Very good.": 2, "Did you need something, mama?": 2, "Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies.": 2, "Did you need something, papa?": 2, "Maybe it would. If you had it.": 2, "Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either.": 2, "Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?": 2, "Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.": 2, "He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.": 2, "Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at...": 2, "I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. ": 2, "I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out.": 2, "May your eyes be sharp and your aim true.": 2, "You're the best! Thanks!": 2, "I wish you well friend. Be careful.": 2, "Mighty Thu\u2019um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!": 2, "Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.": 2, "May your bed be warm and your food sweet.": 2, "Very well. Come for me, then. Come and let's end this!": 2, "May you walk on warm sands.": 2, "Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.": 2, "A new home! Wow! I can't wait to see it!": 2, "Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.": 2, "Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime.": 2, "Did you spot the Dwarven ruins up there? Mzinfazzle, Finchafft, Mzinchaleft? Good thing the Dwarves disappeared and stopped naming things.": 2, "Did you still need me for something?": 2, "Did you take the head?": 2, "Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will.": 2, "Did you think I would run?": 2, "May your road lead you to warm sands.": 2, "I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.": 2, "Speak, elf.": 2, "Ulfric Stromcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.": 2, "Very well then.": 2, "I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.": 2, "Damn. We've got trouble.": 2, "He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.": 2, "Did you require something of J'zargo?": 2, "I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.": 2, "Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory.": 2, "He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come.": 2, "Damn. Another body to get rid of.": 2, "Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.": 2, "I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!": 2, "He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.": 2, "Stay safe!": 2, "May your will carve itself upon the world.": 2, "Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!": 2, "Damn you, Mercer!": 2, "I want to pay you, but I had to cover up the murder. Didn't expect you to go on a killing spree.": 2, "Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...": 2, "We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?": 2, "Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.": 2, "Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness. ": 2, "I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here.": 2, "Submit to Her will!": 2, "I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.": 2, "I understand. Take your time.": 2, "Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial.": 2, "I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own.": 2, "I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple.": 2, "I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please.": 2, "He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.": 2, "Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it.": 2, "Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere.": 2, "Must...kill.": 2, "We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship.": 2, "I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.": 2, "Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.": 2, "Don't be long. My place is by your side.": 2, "I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.": 2, "Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his \"Stormcloaks\" to do it for him.": 2, "Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.": 2, "Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild.": 2, "Hello friend.": 2, "I'd better get going.": 2, "We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.": 2, "I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.": 2, "Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.": 2, "Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!": 2, "Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. ": 2, "Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world.": 2, "You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response.": 2, "Must stay away from the Keepers... must stay away from the Keepers.": 2, "We did well today, Shield-Brother.": 2, "Come on, take another job so we can both make some money.": 2, "Such a shame. I thought we were getting along so well. I'll head back to Riften if you should have second thoughts.": 2, "I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason.": 2, "Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.": 2, "I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.": 2, "Come on, give it your best shot!": 2, "We don't know you, and we don't want you here.": 2, "Don't come back until you have the ring.": 2, "Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.": 2, "We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.": 2, "Those hill people who call themselves \"the Forsworn\" show no mercy.": 2, "Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks.": 2, "I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations.": 2, "My Thu'um is strong!": 2, "Malacath take you!": 2, "We did well today, Shield-Sister.": 2, "We don't get many visitors. Is there something you need?": 2, "I understand. ...Sorry.": 2, "Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree.": 2, "Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me.": 2, "Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you.": 2, "Hello there, miss.": 2, "Those poor spriggans. Ever since you healed the tower, Master Neloth has been experimenting on them.": 2, "Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.": 2, "I had Markarth. My men and I drove the Nords out. We had won, or so we thought.": 2, "We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated.": 2, "We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.": 2, "We do this for the good of Skyrim and her people. Never forget that.": 2, "I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce.": 2, "Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.": 2, "Oh, if you insist!": 2, "Come on, move it. We have Nords to kill.": 2, "Don't be a fool.": 2, "Though... Perhaps there's another option. I, umm, I may require further assistance from you.": 2, "Come on, you monster!": 2, "Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.": 2, "Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here.": 2, "He made it safe for our kind.": 2, "We can talk after I find out what's going on.": 2, "We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you.": 2, "Time for your final rest!": 2, "We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you.": 2, "I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.": 2, "I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.": 2, "Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.": 2, "Sorry to hear that.": 2, "Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught.": 2, "Many fine things are here for you, friend.": 2, "Do your worst, monster!": 2, "Strike the targets as they appear. Breath and focus.": 2, "Time to die!": 2, "Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.": 2, "Many have braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril that guards the way.": 2, "I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this \"friend\" of yours.": 2, "Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.": 2, "Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you.": 2, "Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.": 2, "Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.": 2, "We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move.": 2, "I wanna go swimming, but the guards keep yelling at me. The canal's not that dirty...": 2, "Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant.": 2, "Time to show what you're really made of.": 2, "Mu het. We are here.": 2, "Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.": 2, "Mu fen krif.": 2, "Much obliged. Here. It's not much, but take it anyway.": 2, "I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even remember his own name.": 2, "Tidings.": 2, "Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now.": 2, "Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!": 2, "Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.": 2, "We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention.": 2, "Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so.": 2, "A fateful errand.  No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at Sovngarde's threshold.": 2, "Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are.": 2, "Come on, you need your hands free.": 2, "Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though.": 2, "Mama took me to the market! There were lot of pies and cakes there. She said she'd show me how to bake one!": 2, "Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.": 2, "I guess... I'll hold down the fort by my lonesome. Hurry back and tell them to send a garrison. Quickly!": 2, "Mama! You're back!": 2, "Must be hearing things.": 2, "Mama! You're home!": 2, "Come on. I don't want to hit you until you have your ward ready.": 2, "Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.": 2, "Does the journal say where this wealth came from?": 2, "Strike us with the power of your Voice.": 2, "Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it.": 2, "Thu'um wah Thu'um!": 2, "He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.": 2, "I used to play in the Yorgrim River when I was just a boy. It's true! I was never afraid of the stories about Forsaken Cave, of course.": 2, "Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city.": 2, "Those eyes. All right, killer, go on through. But don't try anything. Madanach knows more than you think.": 2, "Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first.": 2, "I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.": 2, "We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.": 2, "Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen.": 2, "Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.": 2, "I'd best get back to Master Neloth then. No telling what's happened since I've been gone.": 2, "Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead.": 2, "Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?": 2, "I'd just as soon get this over with.": 2, "Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.": 2, "Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!": 2, "Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.": 2, "Son of a...": 2, "I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me.": 2, "This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.": 2, "I trust you have good news for me.": 2, "This way, come on!": 2, "Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.": 2, "We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.": 2, "We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.": 2, "Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.": 2, "We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.": 2, "This way, my daughter.": 2, "This way, my son.": 2, "Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.": 2, "Make me proud.": 2, "This way. Come on!": 2, "We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support.": 2, "Come on now, old girl.": 2, "I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.": 2, "Come on now, you're a sharp one. You must have heard of werewolves before.": 2, "He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin.": 2, "Oh, it's you.": 2, "My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.": 2, "Don't go stopping for a nap. If you fall asleep in this place, you'll never wake up.": 2, "We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand.": 2, "Suit yourself. You're the boss.": 2, "We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path.": 2, "You're supposed to be at the meadery.": 2, "You're sure?": 2, "I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.": 2, "This way... the library isn't far.": 2, "You've no time to glory in your accomplishments.": 2, "Make it stop! Please, make it stop!": 2, "We have to catch up to him before it's too late.": 2, "My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords.": 2, "We hunt together.": 2, "We hunt not only to eat, but also to test our skill.": 2, "Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression.": 2, "My brother was the best man in Solitude.": 2, "We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire.": 2, "He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since.": 2, "This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.  ": 2, "We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence.": 2, "Come in, come in! Make yourself at home!": 2, "I trust this is something important?": 2, "Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!": 2, "Sun feels good, hmm?": 2, "I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do.": 2, "We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?": 2, "Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut.": 2, "We haven't met.": 2, "We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!": 2, "We have to get the Key back.": 2, "Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of.": 2, "Don't hurry back, I won't be waiting.": 2, "We have to keep moving.": 2, "Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.": 2, "Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad.": 2, "We have to move. We'll talk more once we see the sky.": 2, "My brother in crime... what'd you need?": 2, "Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.": 2, "Come in. Quickly now.": 2, "Come in, come in. Too many ears out there.": 2, "Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway.": 2, "This was our land. We were here first. Then the Nords came and put chains on us. Forbid us from worshipping our gods.": 2, "Come mortal, let's end this here and now!": 2, "Do you wish to test yourself against me?": 2, "Don't give up now... there's plenty of loot out there just ripe for the taking.": 2, "Make us proud.": 2, "He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!": 2, "Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job.": 2, "My beacon is sure to attract a worthy soul.": 2, "A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late.": 2, "Come on, I want a better look at that thing.": 2, "Make yourself at home.": 2, "We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.": 2, "You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.": 2, "I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.": 2, "Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.": 2, "Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.": 2, "Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.": 2, "He is weak. And no doubt knows it. He's no fool, he'll come, if only to give his troops a chance to refit.": 2, "He is with me.": 2, "My blade is restless, unblooded too long.": 2, "I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success.": 2, "Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.": 2, "Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.": 2, "Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table.": 2, "We follow you, hunt-master.": 2, "Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.": 2, "I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade.": 2, "Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.": 2, "Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.": 2, "Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.": 2, "We fight till the last!": 2, "We even have a celebration planned for you.": 2, "I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.": 2, "Don't do that, it's mean!": 2, "I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.": 2, "Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.": 2, "Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.": 2, "Make your way to our hidden camp in the Rift. I can't continue to push forward when I'm worried about Eastmarch's southern border.": 2, "Don't forget your represntin' the Guild. Don't do anythin' stupid.": 2, "Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you.": 2, "This woman has endured, has challenged, and has shown her valor.": 2, "Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear.": 2, "Don't give them a chance to warn the others!": 2, "This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?": 2, "This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?": 2, "Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!": 2, "My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you.": 2, "Don't get too flowery on me, lass.": 2, "Don't get too flowery on me, lad.": 2, "This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.": 2, "We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.": 2, "Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.": 2, "Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up.": 2, "Make your peace, mortal!": 2, "Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.": 2, "This'll clear up soon, I'm sure of it.": 2, "My blade is yours to command, Thane.": 2, "We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.": 2, "Don't fret over the gloom, there's nothing to fear! Old Lurbuk will brighten your spirits -- just lend him your ear!": 2, "Thonar Silver-Blood stopped it. He wanted the Forsworn at his call, that I would point their rage at his enemies and spare his allies.": 2, "I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained.": 2, "Oh yes, Listener!": 2, "This will put my father in a great mood. You should come enjoy it while it lasts.": 2, "Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.": 2, "Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.": 2, "Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.": 2, "Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people.": 2, "I trust you've come to see the error handing the hold over to the rebels?": 2, "This'll just take a moment...": 2, "Make your way to our camp in Falkreath. We're going to take it back.": 2, "My bones ache for the moonsugar. It has been too long since I tasted it.": 2, "Time will prove me right.": 2, "Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this.": 2, "Do you remember the sun? Because you'll forget. Soon.": 2, "Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest.": 2, "We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.": 2, "Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.": 2, "Do you think I could be a Bard? I really like singing.": 2, "We are on the hunt.": 2, "Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense?": 2, "Mara protect us both.": 2, "Come! Come and see what goods I offer.": 2, "Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!": 2, "Heard there were wolves on the road up north.": 2, "Move! Move!": 2, "Sorry, I don't have a single septim left after paying the town guard to keep quiet about the mark you killed.": 2, "Do you prefer heedlessness to my luminous glory? Go!": 2, "I expected better from you.": 2, "Mother?": 2, "Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!": 2, "Do you want me to hold your hand as well?": 2, "He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place.": 2, "I guess we'd better try this way.": 2, "To Oblivion with you.": 2, "I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn.": 2, "Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt? ": 2, "Sorry, Listener. It can't be done.": 2, "We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything.": 2, "Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die.": 2, "We better keep going.": 2, "He never sleeps. I don't know how he does it, but he never rests for even a moment.": 2, "Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today.": 2, "We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.": 2, "I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies.": 2, "We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure.": 2, "Many thanks!": 2, "Straight to business with you, huh?": 2, "A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald.": 2, "Come, \"Nightingale!\" Find me if you can!": 2, "Mother!": 2, "To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.": 2, "I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free.": 2, "Oh, he's serious. But so am I.": 2, "I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.": 2, "Come to gawk at the monster?": 2, "Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.": 2, "Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight.": 2, "I yearn to see the great dunes of Hammerfell once again.": 2, "We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you.": 2, "We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers of the Way of the Voice.": 2, "Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?": 2, "We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground.": 2, "We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.": 2, "Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri.": 2, "I wouldn't hold out too much hope.": 2, "We are here. Wundun oblaan. How else can I serve you?": 2, "To be driven from our homes, to be forced here... this is the last thing that Joric needs.": 2, "Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?": 2, "Do you seek to make a purchase?": 2, "A fatal mistake!": 2, "Mara will protect you.": 2, "I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it.": 2, "Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.": 2, "He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.": 2, "Do you need anything else?": 2, "We are all trapped in Alduin's web - for our allegiance he cares not, but devours us equally - doom unescapable.": 2, "Mother had something similar back home when she was tending the courtyard gardens to scrape moss and fungus off of the trees.": 2, "Come, come. I haven't got all day.": 2, "Do you need something from me, Thane? Or can I carry something for you?": 2, "Mara forgives you, my child.": 2, "Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.": 2, "Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.": 2, "Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.": 2, "We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice.": 2, "To arms, brothers! It's the assassin!": 2, "Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?": 2, "I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls.": 2, "Move along, now.": 2, "Mara be praised!": 2, "Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us.": 2, "What are you looking at?": 3, "Aggghhh...": 3, "Right then.": 3, "Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected.": 3, "I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.": 3, "You care nothing for Serana or our plight.": 3, "All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side.": 3, "Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer. ": 3, "I'm afraid it's not that simple.": 3, "Absolutely.": 3, "Right, right... Oh, look at that. I seem to have lost my keys. Might take me a while to find them.": 3, "All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it.": 3, "The round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed to open their cleverest gates.": 3, "Attack while it's landed!": 3, "Sir.": 3, "You need something?": 3, "Well well. Another maggot to squash beneath my boot.": 3, "Ha! Found you!": 3, "Right behind you.": 3, "Right away.": 3, "Speak.": 3, "Now, you just stand there...": 3, "Now we finish this!": 3, "Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.": 3, "Stop that.": 3, "Agghh! ": 3, "Quickly, what did you want?": 3, "Don't fall behind!": 3, "Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.": 3, "Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!": 3, "Extraordinary. I see it now.": 3, "The sky shouldn't look like that...": 3, "The simplest way to put it is \"knowledge,\" but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll.": 3, "Into the dark with you!": 3, "Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch.": 3, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!": 3, "I can take you!": 3, "Yes, Madame Ambassador.": 3, "A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them.": 3, "I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost.": 3, "Most impressive.": 3, "I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!": 3, "Out with it.": 3, "Farengar! Enough, fool!": 3, "There is no point in further talk. Go now!": 3, "Now if you'll excuse me...": 3, "Oh. Well then, I'd best be on my way.": 3, "When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat.": 3, "The Thalmor's memory is long.": 3, "Why does the sky look like that?": 3, "Watch out!": 3, "I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions.": 3, "The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.": 3, "Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will.": 3, "I hope the vampires try to attack us here. A lot easier than hunting them down in their holes.": 3, "Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...": 3, "Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.": 3, "Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill.": 3, "The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.": 3, "That's close enough.": 3, "Thank you!": 3, "Are you sure?": 3, "I am Hermaeus Mora. I have been watching you since we last spoke, and I am pleased with your progress.": 3, "Happy hunting.": 3, "Are you prepared?": 3, "My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.": 3, "What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....": 3, "What?!": 3, "It lick the panes and smokes the glass... ": 3, "Stay sharp out there.": 3, "Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest.": 3, "I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal.": 3, "Citizen.": 3, "Have you taken leave of your senses?": 3, "Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus's remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside.": 3, "There you are. ": 3, "For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.": 3, "Hhuurrrkh...": 3, "He rode through town not long ago with an escort of soldiers. They didn't stop, just headed south across the Dragon Bridge.": 3, "Oh, no you don't!": 3, "Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane.": 3, "Hi there.": 3, "What is the meaning of this?": 3, "Your funeral. Someone else is gonna have to help you get him back in there again.": 3, "That should do it. After you.": 3, "I'm sorry to hear that. It was my honor to have you as a patron. Please let your steward know if you want to hire me again.": 3, "For the Dawn!": 3, "I knew I'd find you!": 3, "For the Forsworn!": 3, "You're no match for me!": 3, "Good...": 3, "They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.": 3, "I am Hermaeus Mora. I have been watching you since you defeated Miraak. Your progress is most impressive.": 3, "All over now.": 3, "In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.": 3, "For the Empire!": 3, "Sit back and enjoy some classical drumming.": 3, "Knew I'd find you!": 3, "Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.": 3, "Yep.": 3, "Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.": 3, "Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting.": 3, "I understand.": 3, "For Ulfric and Skyrim!": 3, "That sound... it's deafening!": 3, "One moment.": 3, "Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.": 3, "Sorry, my ears aren't so good. You say somethin'?": 3, "Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.": 3, "Enough of this!": 3, "For House Hlaalu!": 3, "I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture.": 3, "Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.": 3, "Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead.": 3, "Protect the Jarl!": 3, "Open to the will of Septimus!": 3, "Ha!": 3, "You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily.": 3, "Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.": 3, "Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus.": 3, "There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften.": 3, "Well if you don't have any money, what are we standing here talking about?": 3, "Booooo.": 3, "For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.": 3, "Morvayn will pay for this!": 3, "But no, it is not in my possession.": 3, "You're quite noisy for someone who claims to be a thief.": 3, "Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.": 3, "But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.": 3, "The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.": 3, "Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?": 3, "Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?": 3, "Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!": 3, "What? What is it?": 3, "Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant.": 3, "More rest will do you good.": 3, "Talos preserve you.": 3, "Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end.": 3, "No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though. ": 3, "Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps.": 3, "In you go.": 3, "No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out.": 3, "Ffffeeeargh!": 3, "If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill.": 3, "Don't let it get too close!": 3, "Yes, yes, what is it now?": 3, "It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense. ": 3, "This seems like a really bad idea to me.": 3, "Now that you've retrieved the Elder Scroll, you should be on your way.": 3, "It's all for a good cause, old chap.": 3, "In your dreams! If I win, the next round's on you!": 3, "Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.": 3, "Let's play a game!": 3, "Now that the Dawnguard are back, the vampires' reign of terror is about to end.": 3, "Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try to find him. ": 3, "No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.": 3, "I've got a bad feeling about this.": 3, "Somewhere up north, in the ice fields.": 3, "Bet I can down this ale faster than you!": 3, "Bet I can reach the bottom of this flagon before you!": 3, "You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.": 3, "I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.": 3, "How is the pain? Any better?": 3, "If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her.": 3, "It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.": 3, "Thanks a lot!": 3, "I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.": 3, "I don't think the vampires would be stupid enough to attack us here, but you never know.": 3, "I've fought worse than you!": 3, "Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed.": 3, "Glad the antidote is taking effect.": 3, "Can't hide from me.": 3, "A Moth Priest? I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about that.": 3, "Thank you. The pain is already easing.": 3, "You're back!": 3, "I'll take my leave, then.": 3, "Until next we meet, lass.": 3, "Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking.": 3, "No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape.": 3, "It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.": 3, "Put her mind to rest, allay her fear through vampiric seduction and when she is in a pliant condition, embrace her and bite her on the neck.": 3, "Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but... well, that was years ago.": 3, "Come closer. Bask in my presence.": 3, "Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.": 3, "That's it.": 3, "The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them.": 3, "Here, this should help.": 3, "You've already lost!": 3, "Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?": 3, "Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!": 3, "I'm just itching for a fight.": 3, "What's going on? Where did the sun go?": 3, "Another corpse for the pile.": 3, "How do you feel?": 3, "Oh.": 3, "What's going on?": 3, "What can I get for you?": 3, "Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each.": 3, "Aiiiieee!": 3, "Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now.": 3, "But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.": 3, "Until next we meet, lad.": 3, "Fight well.": 3, "Here. ": 3, "Yes? What is it?": 3, "Until next time.": 3, "They're a splinter group of the \"Vigilants of Stendarr.\" A bit more ambitious, it seems.": 3, "Yes? Did you change your mind?": 3, "Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond.": 3, "Did he now?": 3, "Got to keep alert. We don't want to get caught napping like the Vigilants did.": 3, "Put his mind to rest, allay his fear through vampiric seduction and when he is in a pliant condition, embrace him and bite him on the neck.": 3, "Filthy vampire!": 3, "Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. ": 3, "To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness.": 3, "Don't just stand there! Kill her!": 3, "Don't just stand there! Kill him!": 3, "Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.": 3, "(Sigh)...": 3, "Anybody there?": 3, "I'm glad we're finally taking the fight to those monsters.": 3, "But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp.": 3, "Yes, headmaster.": 3, "Death to the Empire!": 3, "(Laughing.)": 3, "Why am I fighting?": 3, "But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.": 3, "On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby.": 3, "Come on! This is our best chance!": 3, "Your length is cut!": 3, "To this day I've regretted allowing her to escape, even if it meant I had died trying. I owed Gallus that much.": 3, "Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading.": 3, "How can I help?": 3, "Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.": 3, "I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.": 3, "How can I serve you, thuri?": 3, "Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey.": 3, "Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?": 3, "Elder Scrolls. Indeed.": 3, "I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time.": 3, "Death to the Dawnguard!": 3, "Rlyehhhgh1": 3, "The sun... it's gone!": 3, "Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away.": 3, "I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong.": 3, "You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.": 3, "You're on! Loser buys the next round!": 3, "Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it.": 3, "One less monster in the world.": 3, "He's been gone for a long while. Too long.": 3, "Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close.": 3, "You've bested me!": 3, "The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.": 3, "That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going.": 3, "Give it, quickly.": 3, "It's daytime... Why is it so dark outside?": 3, "Now I have some time to kill...": 3, "Thanks for wasting my time. ": 3, "Ha! The most important question of all, that one.": 3, "Your depths will open to the mind!": 3, "You're telling me.": 3, "I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity.": 3, "Are you Dragonborn?": 3, "Looking for work?": 3, "How long will it be sung? My feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down.": 3, "Yes, sera?": 3, "But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.": 3, "That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei.": 3, "Good, you're finally here.": 3, "Yes, sir!": 3, "In time, he brought me here. To the box. ": 3, "I'll... get you...": 3, "I will see you dead, monster.": 3, "Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.": 3, "Unblooded.": 3, "If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map.": 3, "Your end is near!": 3, "Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly.": 3, "Khajiit.": 3, "Feeling any better?": 3, "Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark. ": 3, "What would you ask of me?": 3, "And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about?": 3, "And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?": 3, "Yes, papa.": 3, "And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?": 3, "All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.": 3, "Fire!": 3, "Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me. ": 3, "Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast.": 3, "Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping. ": 3, "You're a connoisseur, indeed. Not many appreciate the subtle beauty of the flute.": 3, "I'll show you what I know.": 3, "I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know.": 3, "This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need.": 3, "To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus.": 3, "To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.": 3, "This one doesn't look too difficult.": 3, "You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.": 3, "This weather seems all wrong to me.": 3, "Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came.": 3, "That was fun.": 3, "What's wrong with the sky?": 3, "I don't want to talk about it.": 3, "Looking for something?": 3, "You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the trouble to catch him in there?": 3, "Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.": 3, "Twenty-five years ago I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why.": 3, "Hunh...": 3, "Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.": 3, "The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw.": 3, "Of course, anything you like!": 3, "But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.": 3, "Is it really dead?": 3, "But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.": 3, "The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.": 3, "Esbern cannot elude us, fool.": 3, "I'm on it.": 3, "The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur. ": 3, "Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.": 3, "I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.": 3, "Haven't heard from him since. ": 3, "The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening.": 3, "Go. Tell your commanders you have won. I, my family, and my men will be gone before they arrive.": 3, "We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.": 3, "I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.": 3, "By the gods, is that the Voice?": 3, "Get ready to open the trap!": 3, "This doesn't look good.": 3, "Bye.": 3, "One thing's certain. I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.": 3, "Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.": 3, "The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.": 3, "The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key.": 3, "Patience. The body needs time to mend.": 3, "The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.": 3, "Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.": 3, "We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice.": 3, "It's over. No more violence.": 3, "I don't think so.": 3, "She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.": 3, "You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite.": 3, "I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.": 3, "Go, you're not wanted here.": 3, "Breton.": 3, "In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!": 3, "Freedom or Sovngarde!": 3, "I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!": 3, "I know I heard something.": 3, "May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!": 3, "The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm.": 3, "Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.": 3, "Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors.": 3, "Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me. ": 3, "Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to your depths.": 3, "Legate.": 3, "He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure.": 3, "Why is it so dark?": 3, "I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.": 3, "But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?": 3, "Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.": 3, "Be seeing you.": 3, "Get back, thief!": 3, "He was after Margret. Why?": 3, "The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.": 3, "We surrender. The capital is yours. If you pledge no harm will come of my people, I turn over the seat of power to you.": 3, "Exactly.": 3, "We were searching the farm when the ash spawn ambushed us. Have a look around and see if you can turn up anything useful.": 3, "I feel better already.": 3, "You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?": 3, "Look old woman. If your boy wants to learn how to fight, we'll teach him. Now off with you.": 3, "Wait!": 3, "I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.": 3, "The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it.": 3, "Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.": 3, "Oh, hi, I'm glad I ran into you. I was wondering if...": 3, "There's two more of them ahead.": 3, "Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.": 3, "Gallus would call her his \"little nightingale.\" He was absolutely smitten by her.": 3, "Nord.": 3, "Peace!": 3, "The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.": 3, "What foul magic could put the sun out?": 3, "Trust Septimus. He knows you can know. ": 3, "Gods curse you!": 3, "He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well.": 3, "Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation.": 3, "Gods bless you, healer.": 3, "So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.": 3, "When the top level was built, no more could be placed. It was and is the maximal apex.": 3, "Hey, watch it!": 3, "I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?": 3, "With pleasure.": 3, "Isran knows how to fight those monsters. He's been preparing for this day for a long time.": 3, "Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.": 3, "The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty.": 3, "I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!": 3, "I hope someone knows where we're going.": 3, "I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.": 3, "We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.": 3, "Wait...": 3, "I suggest you aim elsewhere.": 3, "These boys do good work for the Empire!": 3, "Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own.": 3, "By the gods...": 3, "Imperial.": 3, "We've got to ground that bastard!": 3, "I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!": 3, "Hey! What the... keep your damn magic to yourself.": 3, "Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan.": 3, "Someone's going to get hurt, all right. ": 3, "Everyone, inside. Now!": 3, "When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?": 3, "Cease fighting. It's over.": 3, "I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves.": 3, "You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?": 3, "Imperial dogs!": 3, "The day is dark as night! What's happening?": 3, "Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint.": 3, "Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.": 3, "I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much.": 3, "Aaaiiee!": 3, "Not a serious threat, but we can't leave them completely unchecked or they may become one.": 3, "Nooo....": 3, "Shut up.": 3, "Try asking one of the guards.": 3, "Nerevar guide me!": 3, "Ice-Veins.": 3, "Redguard.": 3, "It's the only outsider Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.": 3, "You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.": 3, "You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.": 3, "There's the Blades agent! Kill her!": 3, "There's the Blades agent! Kill him!": 3, "Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.": 3, "One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return.": 3, "The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?": 3, "Of course, ma'am.": 3, "Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature.": 3, "I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best.": 3, "That's a dangerous game you're playing.": 3, "You have a death wish?": 3, "Do you... do you think I could keep him for you?": 3, "Do you... do you think I could keep him?": 3, "You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?": 3, "You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?": 3, "My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot.": 3, "Here you go.": 3, "I apologize for the disruption to such a festive occasion.": 3, "You won't take us alive!": 3, "Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman.": 3, "Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.": 3, "Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though.": 3, "Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.": 3, "Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim.": 3, "Must've run off.": 3, "Must you keep stopping?": 3, "Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you.": 3, "Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls. ": 3, "More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.": 3, "Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. ": 3, "Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really.": 3, "The Forsworn. Here inside the city.": 3, "Not this again.": 3, "Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round.": 3, "The Dawnguard are apparently focused on exterminating vampires, noble and brute alike.": 3, "Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people.": 3, "There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.": 3, "Where did the sun go?": 3, "Dragons weren't enough. Now we've lost the sun too?": 3, "Go with the gods.": 3, "I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.": 3, "My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.": 3, "Traitor!": 3, "Leave or be removed.": 3, "Too easy.": 3, "The most elegant of instruments. The pinnacle of the bardic art.": 3, "Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.": 3, "What about... wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling? ": 3, "Leave now or suffer dire consequences.": 3, "I can't see the sun. Where did it go?": 3, "Enough! Stop!": 3, "Careful!": 3, "Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.": 3, "But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone. ": 3, "I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you. ": 3, "The box contains the heart. The essence of a god.": 3, "Come on, this way.": 3, "The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.": 3, "Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.": 3, "What do you think you're doing?": 3, "That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.": 3, "Yaaaargh!": 3, "Certainly. I am trained in the three traditional bardic instruments: lute, drum, and flute. Which would you prefer?": 3, "Damn it, no more!": 3, "Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.": 3, "This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder. ": 3, "Argonian.": 3, "Oh... so terrible. When will these dark times be over?": 3, "Die, damn you!": 3, "Nothing.": 3, "Private quarters are strictly off limits. You have been warned.": 3, "When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum.": 3, "The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.": 3, "Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act.": 3, "Your wish is my command, as always.": 3, "I don't understand... did you say Ulfric Stormcloak? Fine fellow, although a bit too fond of... I mean, no, of course, I condemn him in the most...": 3, "Ah, so that was a Moth Priest, then?": 3, "Enthir... Gallus's friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...": 3, "You have my thanks.": 3, "You win! I submit!": 3, "What in Arkay's name was that?": 3, "Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.": 3, "Mine's closed. Move along.": 3, "Die, monster!": 3, "By the Divines, what happened to the sky?": 3, "Hey, when you make up your mind, just let me know. I'll be here.": 3, "Have you heard of Blackreach? \"Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.\"": 3, "An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.": 3, "Come, my champion.": 3, "I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge.": 3, "Perish, worm!": 3, "I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books.": 3, "Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.": 3, "The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.": 3, "I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered.": 3, "Has your fever cooled?": 3, "There's little time for talk, what do you want?": 3, "Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.": 3, "Get it into the trap before it kills us all!": 4, "I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.": 4, "Nuh!": 4, "Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?": 4, "We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.": 4, "I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two.": 4, "Get down to the front line.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.": 4, "No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind.": 4, "You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.": 4, "You mean Ulfric's so-called \"Stormcloak rebellion\"?": 4, "We're taking Falkreath. Get over there with the others. Fight well or die well.": 4, "The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt!": 4, "Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.": 4, "No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me.": 4, "<Laughter>": 4, "You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.": 4, "Phew!": 4, "We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!": 4, "You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.": 4, "Help yourself to as much ore as you like... you've earned it.": 4, "I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck.": 4, "Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.": 4, "Ain't too often we get a visitor like that.": 4, "And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls that supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's \"peace treaty.\"": 4, "It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements.": 4, "Can't do it.": 4, "I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.": 4, "Get out of my face. ": 4, "That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for.": 4, "If you are, then you make your way to Windhelm and talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.": 4, "Got you!": 4, "You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.": 4, "That's right. It isn't.": 4, "You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.": 4, "A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.": 4, "We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry.": 4, "We're taking Whiterun. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.": 4, "Come, let us share a cup of mead, and trade tales of our time on Mundus, reliving the glory of our remembered deeds.": 4, "You made your decision. Now live with it.": 4, "The blood calls, brother.": 4, "A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.": 4, "A round for all of my friends!": 4, "The blood calls, sister.": 4, "Yes?": 4, "We're taking the capital. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.": 4, "All the living shall fear the dead!": 4, "Ain't no doubt about it. The Thieves Guild is back, and they've got Riften in their grip.": 4, "Is there anything else I can get for you?": 4, "Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.": 4, "Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.": 4, "Really? All right! You pick. Tag or hide-and-seek?": 4, "You've returned.": 4, "You want something from me?": 4, "I haven't set foot in these mines for ages. It's strange being back after so long.": 4, "I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.": 4, "A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.": 4, "I will return...": 4, "Glory to the Forsworn!": 4, "Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you!": 4, "Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally.": 4, "Nyagh!": 4, "Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.": 4, "Nyargh!": 4, "Let's talk inside.": 4, "Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.": 4, "Then I guess that's your last request, fool!": 4, "Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.": 4, "You're it!": 4, "You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there...": 4, "We're already late. Not sure why we decided to take such an extended shore time.": 4, "That's right. ": 4, "Ha, found you!": 4, "A dragon? It's a dragon! Gods help us!": 4, "In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.": 4, "The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, \"Jarls\" - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.": 4, "You're finding it. That's bad enough.": 4, "If you are, then you talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.": 4, "I can see that.": 4, "We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.": 4, "You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal.": 4, "Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.": 4, "We meet again, mortal!": 4, "I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone.": 4, "Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?": 4, "Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight.": 4, "Find enemy controlled resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, and sabotage them.": 4, "We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.": 4, "We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.": 4, "Is someone there?": 4, "Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?": 4, "You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive.": 4, "If you run across any enemy couriers, take them down, and bring me whatever they're carrying.": 4, "And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.": 4, "10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Prepared or not, I'm coming!": 4, "Please proceed into the Embassy.": 4, "Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.": 4, "We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it.": 4, "Found this among the dead. Something tells me I should give it to you.": 4, "We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done.": 4, "I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...": 4, "Rexus. The items.": 4, "Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.": 4, "May knowledge of your Divinity carry us through our daily trials.": 4, "Good to hear.": 4, "We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done.": 4, "Your body lies dead, but your soul has joined our ranks...": 4, "Gone. The living are right to fear the dead.": 4, "Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! ": 4, "Oh, he just left a short while ago. He said he'd finished up his work and it was time to move on.": 4, "Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.": 4, "I knew I could count on you.": 4, "If that is what you wish.": 4, "I need you to create some chaos in the hold.": 4, "It is by Shor's command that we curb our wrath - so let's feast and sing 'til our fate calls us.": 4, "And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled.": 4, "Found you!": 4, "We're not supposed to talk to the guests.": 4, "All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.": 4, "I long to fight that foul worm.": 4, "No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared.": 4, "You dare hide from me?": 4, "Welcome to Raven Rock Mine, outlander.": 4, "Nobody here now.": 4, "An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?": 4, "Agh! Pathetic mortal!": 4, "Is it over?": 4, "I... I don't have any money.": 4, "For Whiterun! For the Empire!": 4, "We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them.": 4, "Getting your hands dirty, outlander?": 4, "Good to know that the mine's safe again. I heard a lot of strange things happened here.": 4, "Agh...": 4, "We're liberating Morthal. Join the brothers gathering for the attack. Talos be with you.": 4, "Certainly! It's a fine tune and a good request!": 4, "If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work.": 4, "A Forsworn agent. Running loose in the city. The Jarl is going to hear about this.": 4, "I need you to create some chaos in the hold so I can maneuver men into position without drawing too much attention.": 4, "Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun.": 4, "Come on, hurry up.": 4, "We're not quite ready to muster the final attack.": 4, "The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?": 4, "We're mounting our attack on Markarth. Get over there and join the brothers gathering for the attack. This is it now! Talos be with you.": 4, "We'd better keep moving.": 4, "We're mounting our final attack on Solitude. Get over there and join the rest of the army. They'll be launching the attack soon. Talos be with you!": 4, "You got me.": 4, "Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month.": 4, "You got here just in time.": 4, "And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um.": 4, "If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone.": 4, "I'll meet you at the shrine.": 4, "Watch it!": 4, "Good hunting.": 4, "Here's what I can spare.": 4, "The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this.": 4, "Is it dead?": 4, "Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself.": 4, "Remind us of our place, when we forget.": 4, "If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tulius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim.": 4, "If you're serious, you're in the right place. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. Here you'll find General Tullius, commanding our forces in Skyrim.": 4, "I must've been hearing things.": 4, "Waaagh!": 4, "Good luck out there!": 4, "Guests are advised to remain inside the Embassy.": 4, "By Ysmir! There's a killer about.": 4, "For the Blades!": 4, "Heeya!": 4, "Guess it was nothing after all.": 4, "The answer ain't gonna be any different the next time. Arrogant elven bastard.": 4, "You must present your invitation to be admitted to the party.": 4, "That's all I can tell you. He asked me not to let anyone know where he was going. I suppose he didn't want the attention.": 4, "Nothing... Nothing...": 4, "It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan.": 4, "You stand right there and count to 10. No peeking. Ready? Okay go!": 4, "By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?": 4, "Hrm.": 4, "For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.": 4, "Please... No more...": 4, "Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.": 4, "We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all.": 4, "Raagghh!": 4, "Papa! We're playing a game. Do you want to play?": 4, "Good luck out there.": 4, "You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.": 4, "It hardly matters though. The door to the stairs is securely locked. There's no way anyone without the key can get in. So don't you worry about it.": 4, "We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the capital. I thought you should be the one to have it.": 4, "We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the city. I thought you should be the one to have it.": 4, "We'll handle things from here. Move along.": 4, "We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's visiting! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.": 4, "Gah...": 4, "We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's cousin is getting married! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.": 4, "Not so loud!": 4, "Listen up, spy! You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice.": 4, "And take out resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, with a little sabotage.": 4, "By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...": 4, "Listen well, friend, and lighten your mood while words I'll spin of warriors bold, whose deeds of valor brought undying fame.": 4, "Soon you will know the cold of death...": 4, "Thanks to House Redoran getting these mines reopened, I can provide for my family again.": 4, "And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught!": 4, "A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.": 4, "Noooo!": 4, "We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.": 4, "The Thalmor Embassy welcomes you.": 4, "Death comes for you now!": 4, "You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.": 4, "You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.": 4, "That's what I keep telling myself.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.": 4, "Really? Where are we going?": 4, "<Giggling>": 4, "You've been warned, outsider.": 4, "Ha! You caught me!": 4, "You've been warned.": 4, "A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.": 4, "Ha! You can never truly stop me!": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.": 4, "Sorry, but that Moth Priest's comings and goings are none of my business, and none of yours either.": 4, "Go right on in. The party has already started.": 4, "It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.": 4, "You. I've seen you snooping around. Asking questions.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.": 4, "The endless sleep comes for us all...": 4, "Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?": 4, "Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.": 4, "I hope you've readied yourself.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.": 4, "Now, back to the matter at hand.": 4, "We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.": 4, "The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it.": 4, "And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age.": 4, "Mama!": 4, "You can't hide from me!": 4, "Ah, well, in that case I'll tell you what I know.": 4, "All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish.": 4, "Right.": 4, "By the gods, a dragon! How?": 4, "Good work!": 4, "Look out! Draugr!": 4, "I offer you eternity!": 4, "No, only members of the Circle get this blessing. Right now we're just seeing if you're worth keeping around.": 4, "You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come.": 4, "Gods, you're boring!": 4, "I know you can hear me!": 4, "He's got to be here somewhere.": 4, "We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.": 4, "I know all the good spots! You don't stand a chance!": 4, "Aggghh...": 4, "A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.": 4, "We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.": 4, "The Imperials are here. All lined up pretty-like in their shiny armor. We'll put a few dents in those bastards before we give up the city. Move it! ": 4, "Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.": 4, "Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim. ": 4, "Mama! We're playing a game. Do you want to play?": 4, "Noo...": 4, "Was there something else?": 4, "The glimmer of life is gone...": 4, "I beg your pardon?": 4, "That's what I thought.": 4, "We will speak more.": 4, "You're going to regret this.": 4, "Funny.": 4, "Not so ridiculous, really. I know people don't think much of her. But she is the Jarl after all.  Plenty of folk would kill to be in her shoes.": 4, "I would hate to think what would happen if this fell into enemy hands.": 4, "The sky is so dark. What does it mean?": 4, "And sabotage enemy controlled resources.": 4, "I hope there aren't any more.": 4, "You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe...": 4, "That'll teach you to cross me.": 4, "We're outnumbered, but I have a plan.": 4, "None of you will be alive to tell it.": 4, "We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.": 4, "Very funny.": 4, "We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.": 4, "The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are.": 4, "Ruh!": 4, "Woof.": 4, "Eternal slumber awaits...": 4, "I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.": 4, "I'm not sure if that's a good thing...": 4, "Hope our shipments are still good. How long has it been?": 4, "A cup I'll gladly raise in company with you. None have yet bested me in boasting or drinking.": 4, "I'm sorry, sir, I'm on duty.": 4, "I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.": 4, "What have you done?": 4, "A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.": 4, "I'm waiting.": 4, "Hey. You wanna play a game?": 4, "He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I hope that helps you.": 4, "She'll never find me here.": 4, "Ugh! Only a fool tries to kill the dead!": 4, "I suppose so. But believe me. Only us servants have a key like that, and its a very expensive looking lock. Really, I wouldn't worry about it.": 4, "This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.": 4, "Nice try, but you don't scare me.": 4, "Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.": 4, "But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.": 4, "Once you find the courier's route, kill him and take his place.": 4, "When the tide goes, we'll go with it. ": 4, "Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it.": 4, "Leave me alone!": 4, "Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.": 4, "But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.": 4, "Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry.": 4, "There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other.": 4, "A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies.": 4, "Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?": 4, "Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.": 4, "At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim.": 4, "Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.": 4, "This is a good hiding spot.": 4, "Be careful. This woman is known to be dangerous.": 4, "Don't you walk away from me!": 4, "Take care.": 4, "This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?": 4, "Die now, and live forever!": 4, "This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords.": 4, "This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!": 4, "Surrender immediately or you both die.": 4, "Hhyyaarrgghh!": 4, "Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this.": 4, "Did you hear something?": 4, "A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.": 4, "Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised.": 4, "I've come to rely on you. There's something I want you to have. It was my father's. It would be my honor if you carried it.": 4, "I'm not going to ask again.": 4, "A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.": 4, "It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?": 4, "Need... to sleep...": 4, "Thank you, sir. Go right in.": 4, "So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.": 4, "They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises!": 4, "Here. Take this for your trouble. ": 4, "There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.": 4, "Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this.": 4, "What in the...?": 4, "My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts.": 4, "Here. Take a look for yourself. But give it back soon. It's almost time for milady's medicine.": 4, "Argh! You found me!": 4, "Why? What are you gonna do, cry?": 4, "UUggghhhh.....": 4, "Thank you, ma'am. Go right in.": 4, "But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire.": 4, "Even still, I make a point of announcing myself when I enter her room now. I spooked her so bad last time she almost threw the chamber pot at me!": 4, "Tread lightly.": 4, "I suppose it would be. Good thinking.": 4, "Excellent. These should come in handy.": 4, "Yes, mother.": 4, "I watch you to make sure you are honorable. ": 4, "Yes, my Jarl.": 4, "Nice to be making some coin again.": 4, "Shall Alduin remain so long unchallenged?": 4, "Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true son of Skyrim, or you're not.": 4, "She's locked herself in her room not letting anyone in. Well, except for us servants. She's afraid of assassins coming to get her.": 4, "Yeeaaaggh!": 4, "What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?": 4, "Join the dead!": 4, "I sense a presence...": 4, "What did you want?": 4, "Back off. You don't want to know what happens to troublemakers here.": 4, "Show me.": 4, "What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?": 4, "Where... am I...": 4, "Of course. Take what you need.": 4, "Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?": 4, "Fair enough.": 4, "It's good to get back to mining after all these years.": 4, "Oh! You got me!": 4, "It's like I said, I'm not going to talk about it.": 4, "My turn!": 4, "Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?": 4, "I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.": 4, "Joooo fah!": 4, "I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes.": 4, "Who said anything about trouble? Now get out of my face.": 4, "Shor's bones... how did they find this place?": 4, "Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.": 4, "Who dares disturb my rest?": 4, "Yes, Grelod.": 4, "He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.": 4, "Hmm? Does someone live among the dead?": 4, "Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another.": 4, "Who are you?...": 4, "Aww...": 4, "Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them.": 4, "What are you waiting for? Go!": 4, "Thank you for your role in all of this. ": 4, "Fall, damn you!": 4, "Ease your heart, our honor is unstained - it's by Shor's command we curb our onslaught.": 4, "Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target.": 4, "So what do you want to know?": 4, "Think we've got to get back to our ship now.": 4, "At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.": 4, "This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.": 4, "I've been out of the business so long, I almost forgot how to swing a pickaxe.": 4, "Battle-Born! Give me your money!": 4, "Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.": 4, "Silence, prisoner!": 4, "Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.": 4, "You're... dead!": 4, "Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold.": 4, "Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.": 4, "Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly.": 4, "Mortal fool! No one hides from the dead!": 4, "Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.": 4, "Why me...": 4, "Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true daughter of Skyrim, or you're not.": 4, "Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for.": 4, "Well, she needs to eat. I don't think she even knows where the kitchen is. And milady isn't exactly going to remove her own chamber pot, now is she?": 4, "I'm going to find whoever did this, and when I do...": 4, "I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.": 4, "At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm.": 4, "Move!": 4, "I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.": 4, "Let us walk in the steps of the Divines.": 4, "Your shroud awaits!": 4, "They say that vampires attacked the Hall of the Vigilant. Burned it to the ground! Never heard of vampires doing anything like that before.": 4, "At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.": 4, "At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.": 4, "Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.": 4, "There is no more life here.": 4, "My old bones don't hurt so much now.": 4, "Let us not spurn our lord's bounty - this hall is his gift, for glory well-earned.": 4, "Naggh!": 4, "Time to end your foolish charade!": 4, "I crave a tale of tall ships and fearless heroes, for heart's ease.": 4, "I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...": 4, "Let me see that!": 4, "One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward.": 4, "I still sense your presence, living fool...": 4, "But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray.": 4, "A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.": 4, "Every door has a key, says Vilkas. Sometimes he is wrong, but look around anyway.": 4, "Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands!": 4, "It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.": 4, "I found you! Na na na, na na na!": 4, "Your invitation, please.": 4, "There's nothing quite like the sound of metal striking rock.": 4, "Won't lie, I am. And you?": 4, "Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still.": 4, "Only true Imperials request that one.": 4, "Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir.": 4, "What? Someone will suffer for this injustice.": 4, "Diplomatic as usual.": 4, "Let me go...": 4, "Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?": 4, "Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.": 4, "Divines help us!": 4, "Well, you've come to the right place.": 4, "Of course, sir.": 4, "He he he.": 4, "I said move along. The Forsworn are just a bunch of madmen. We have everything under control. Stay out of it.": 4, "This mine's amazing! Have you ever seen so much ebony in your life?": 4, "Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold.": 4, "Finality.": 4, "This looks like the guardian chamber. The key to that door has to be around here somewhere.": 4, "It's the End Times! The End Times have come!": 4, "Sure, my voice could use a rest.": 4, "Better to stick together down here.": 4, "Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes.": 4, "He'll never find me here.": 4, "Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time. ": 4, "Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. ": 4, "Yes.": 4, "Woah!": 4, "Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to...": 4, "Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be.": 4, "I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.": 4, "Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me.": 4, "Another round, on me!": 4, "I have no business with you.": 4, "This was their city once. They won't stop until we're all dead.": 4, "Figures. You elders are always so boring.": 4, "I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me.": 4, "Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!": 4, "Here. I want you to have this. Don't ask. Just take it.": 4, "What's happening...": 4, "Never much cared for folks who can't mind their own business.": 4, "Don't delay, Shield-Brother.": 4, "I'm just doing my duty, sir.": 4, "Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.": 4, "No problem.": 4, "So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years.": 4, "Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.": 4, "Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!": 4, "Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves.": 4, "Don't delay, Shield-Sister.": 4, "But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.": 4, "What? Where are we going?": 4, "Such an abrupt end to our game.": 4, "With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.": 4, "Stay away from me!": 4, "Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.": 4, "He took the road southwest out of town, and said he was going to be crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all that he told me. I hope it helps.": 4, "Have I heard anything? It was the talk of the city for three days straight.": 4, "Best be shoving off now.": 4, "It's a long way back to Windhelm from here.": 4, "You're too slow!": 4, "Then that is my task.": 4, "This is your last warning, outsider. We keep the peace, here. Stay out of our business.": 4, "Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip.": 4, "It's all on account of this blasted ring.": 4, "Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries.": 4, "Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.": 4, "What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother.": 4, "Search out enemy soldiers in the wilderness, or guarding towns and settlements, and kill them.": 4, "The finest skooma, the sweetest moon sugar. At a fair price, of course. ": 5, "Be careful around here. You don't want to anger the wrong person.": 5, "We may be rough, but we don't tolerate thieving around here. If that's your game, go join the lowlives in Riften.": 5, "You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.": 5, "Shhh!": 5, "You can't hide from me forever.": 5, "If you say so.": 5, "And so it ends.": 5, "You want a drink?": 5, "This better be important.": 5, "Hrargh!": 5, "I'm going to find you.": 5, "What do you want... cat?": 5, "Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.": 5, "You want another one of those?": 5, "Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks.": 5, "See you.": 5, "Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.": 5, "Please, don't kill me!": 5, "Damn outsiders.": 5, "Thanks! I thought I was going to rot in here. So what's the plan?": 5, "Here, it's all I can spare...": 5, "We've got to bring it down!": 5, "Too slow!": 5, "Let's teach these bastards a lesson.": 5, "You can't catch me!": 5, "Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?": 5, "He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him.": 5, "It is? Well that's different.": 5, "Yessir!": 5, "Hey! Watch what you're doing.": 5, "We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse.": 5, "The Imperials think we need their laws. Pfft.": 5, "Outlanders should mind their own business.": 5, "Each has their own way.": 5, "Yyyyrrrraaaaahhhhh!": 5, "Hmm... we've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous men, beasts, or worse.": 5, "(coughing fit) Uuughhnnn...": 5, "I know you're here somewhere.": 5, "I'll find you eventually.": 5, "What's happening?": 5, "Last but not least. Let's go!": 5, "There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.": 5, "Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.": 5, "Ahhh!": 5, "The Stormcloaks pay blood for blood!": 5, "For Skyrim!": 5, "Damn, where'd you go?": 5, "We'll see.": 5, "The guard has the key.": 5, "Stay out of trouble, lizard.": 5, "Everything is splendid, thank you.": 5, "Yyyyyeeeaaaaahhhhhh!": 5, "Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.": 5, "The prisoners are escaping!": 5, "He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him.": 5, "For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.": 5, "They'll think twice before coming back here, that's for sure!": 5, "There was no other way it could end.": 5, "Oh well. Must have run off.": 5, "I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.": 5, "One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief.": 5, "I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil.": 5, "We've had the same troubles.": 5, "Go away!": 5, "You there, please you have to help me! I was attacked by a vampire! Do you have a potion or something that can cure this before I turn?": 5, "Never!": 5, "It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.": 5, "Bad idea.": 5, "Ah, well, if Hadvar vouches for you I guess it must be all right.": 5, "Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!": 5, "We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here.": 5, "Yeah... That's not going to happen.": 5, "We barely have enough for ourselves...": 5, "The Imperials think us all lawless beasts. I'm proof of their ignorance.": 5, "Where'd you come from?": 5, "Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children.": 5, "What's on your mind?": 5, "Then let me speed your passage to Sovngarde!": 5, "Did you need something?": 5, "The Jarl has things under control. Don't you worry.": 5, "Stormcloaks! Get them!": 5, "Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.": 5, "Unnff!": 5, "Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhhh!": 5, "Hold your head up. I'm sure it won't happen again.": 5, "Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.": 5, "Ah, you're back.": 5, "Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks.": 5, "Stormcloaks! Filthy traitors!": 5, "Go away.": 5, "Are you prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His enlightenment?": 5, "Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.": 5, "How are we doing over here?": 5, "Now that's just sad. Come back when you actually have something to show for your thieving.": 5, "This way.": 5, "What next?": 5, "We did it!": 5, "It would be my pleasure.": 5, "Wwwwwwrrrraaaaaahhhhh!": 5, "Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up.": 5, "Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.": 5, "What is it, Elf?": 5, "What is it now?": 5, "What now?": 5, "Hhhhhuuuuuzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!": 5, "You have no business in our stronghold, outlander.": 5, "Hhhhhhuuuuuuaaaaaa!": 5, "Hhhhhhhaaaaaa!": 5, "Is... is someone there?": 5, "What's the plan?": 5, "Aaaahhhhhrrrr.... the pain, somebody, stop... the pain...": 5, "Ugh!": 5, "Well, if you insist...": 5, "Good! I've got a few scores to settle.": 5, "Uuuuhhhnnnn... it hurts...": 5, "Ah, a snitch, eh? Can't have you running to any guards now, can I? ": 5, "Going to hide, are you?": 5, "Point that somewhere else!": 5, "Is that all?": 5, "Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.": 5, "Cleared out, I guess.": 5, "Rrrraaaaaaggghhhh!": 5, "Aaaaaahhhhaaaaa!": 5, "A dragon.... First in a thousand years....": 5, "Don't cross me, Elf.": 5, "Here's the gold for it. Thanks.": 5, "Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.": 5, "Hello? Who's there?": 5, "Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.": 5, "Don't come back.": 5, "And what about Jarl Erikur?": 5, "And what about Jarl Elisif?": 5, "Greetings, brother. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.": 5, "Those fools are actually fighting!": 5, "It's time for you to go.": 5, "No one here now.": 5, "We sure showed them!": 5, "Hhyyaarargghhhh!": 5, "I think you've been taking things that don't belong to you. Pay your debts, and we'll forget this happened.": 5, "Nice doing business with you, friend. ": 5, "Get going!": 5, "You are not welcome here!": 5, "The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it.": 5, "The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price.": 5, "Yes, mum!": 5, "They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Bring them to our chief, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs.": 5, "Rrrrraaaaa!": 5, "Thanks again.": 5, "Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!": 5, "I'm sorry...": 5, "With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.": 5, "And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!": 5, "You won't leave Helgen alive!": 5, "And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!": 5, "Nothing for it but to keep moving.": 5, "Greetings, sister. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.": 5, "Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.": 5, "Ah, good. I've been waiting on that.": 5, "But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...": 5, "I feel so alive!": 5, "Huzzah!": 5, "No need to be worried, I suppose.": 5, "And stay out.": 5, "My money's on the big one.": 5, "That's the end of that.": 5, "I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...": 5, "Death is highly overrated!": 5, "Skyrim has no use for your kind.": 5, "Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?": 5, "Stay out of trouble, Elf.": 5, "This one has something sweet for the fellow traveler, if it entices. ": 5, "I'm listening.": 5, "How dare you!": 5, "Hahaha!": 5, "Great, let's go!": 5, "We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?": 5, "Come back and fight me!": 5, "You're gonna get me out of here?": 5, "We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong.": 5, "And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!": 5, "Thank you, Harbinger.": 5, "Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?": 5, "By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the \"Forge-wife\" in honor of this.": 5, "Be careful.": 5, "Now you're being ridiculous. This is our city. Not theirs.": 5, "It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.": 5, "No need to get so... hostile. Just take it. Sounds like you need it more than I do.": 5, "We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.": 5, "For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now.": 5, "Now, now! That won't be necessary.": 5, "Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest.": 5, "Shadows take you!": 6, "Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?": 6, "If he's willing, then we'll talk.": 6, "Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages.": 6, "Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King.": 6, "Oh... well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business.": 6, "I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.": 6, "Damn it, this will not stand!": 6, "What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.": 6, "Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But... how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?": 6, "I can't believe I'm still alive.": 6, "I'm still amazed that your plan worked.": 6, "Weergh!": 6, "Now! Quickly!": 6, "But I'm warning you, do anything funny, and you'll regret it.": 6, "Shor's bones, here he comes!": 6, "Hold it there! Keep your distance.": 6, "I didn't say anything about giving up.": 6, "Free mead!": 6, "Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!": 6, "Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!": 6, "Ask her about it if you want an earful.": 6, "A...a body! How absolutely terrible.": 6, "It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.": 6, "Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons - and this war into the bargain.": 6, "I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can.": 6, "A song? I, uh... I seem to have misplaced my lute. Another time perhaps?": 6, "We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth.": 6, "My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.": 6, "No.": 6, "One way or another, get me those documents.": 6, "You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?": 6, "Look, there's a war going on, if you hadn't heard. We barely have enough soldiers to walk the streets, much less patrol every corner.": 6, "Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.": 6, "Lead me into battle.": 6, "Might even give you a bit of gold for it.": 6, "But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?": 6, "I can't believe that worked!": 6, "Why? What do you want?": 6, "Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down.": 6, "Yeah?": 6, "My wares? I, uh... Oh so sorry, I'm all sold out.": 6, "They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.": 6, "No Sam, no protection. Time to die.": 6, "All right. I do worry, though, no matter how many times the guards say Markarth is safe.": 6, "No Nord could have said it better! I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.": 6, "Lead the way. Take me to this \"monster\" of yours.": 6, "We've got to find someplace to hide!": 6, "We're ready, Dragonborn. Just say the word.": 6, "What are we waiting for?": 6, "As I promised, my men stand ready. The great chains are oiled. We wait on your word.": 6, "Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.": 6, "So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?": 6, "No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.": 6, "Look, friend, if you think you can do better than the legion of guards, be my guest. ": 6, "Yeeeaarrggh!": 6, "Ugh...": 6, "Yeah!": 6, "Safe travels.": 6, "Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.": 6, "Settle down. No need for threats. Lead the way. But I'm warning you, I'm not afraid to fight you if I have to.": 6, "But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.": 6, "You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?": 6, "If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.": 6, "Leave me alone.": 6, "Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.": 6, "Monster? What monster? Don't know what you're game is, but I'll humor for a moment.": 6, "What are you talking about? I don't know anything about any monsters.": 6, "Uggh...": 6, "Very well, love. This is a beautiful house, and Solitude is so safe, so diverse. It's a wonderful place to raise a child.": 6, "Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!": 6, "You're mine!": 6, "See if you can't \"convince\" one of those innkeepers to help you.": 6, "Take cover!": 6, "What do... huh?": 6, "You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?": 6, "Help! I'm being attacked!": 6, "Once you leave the party you can't just come back.": 6, "Skjor was looking for you, earlier.": 6, "I beg your pardon, ma'am. I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.": 6, "Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.": 6, "You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business.": 6, "I beg your pardon, sir. I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.": 6, "Fine, love. I think the fresh air does wonders for all of us, and this house... it's just perfect.": 6, "I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.": 6, "Rrargh!": 6, "I'm no so easily coerced. I've got my eye on you. Try anything, and you will be the one who regrets it.": 6, "Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.": 6, "If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.": 6, "Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?": 6, "What...? No... No, this can't be happening...": 6, "Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things.": 6, "Yes, I'm ready to do my part.": 6, "I think it's holding!": 6, "I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me.": 6, "You afraid to fight me?": 6, "If you want to help, ask some of these gawkers if they saw anything useful. ": 6, "This was your crazy idea, huh?": 6, "We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry.": 6, "I think her mother, Tova, has the key.": 6, "Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap.": 6, "Unh...": 6, "Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.": 6, "Something to tell the grandkids, eh?": 6, "Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you.": 6, "Good evening.": 6, "I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.": 6, "Good job!": 6, "Good enough.": 6, "Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up.": 6, "No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.": 6, "Good afternoon.": 6, "Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.": 6, "Well, love, very well. There's so much history in this city, so many things we can do here.": 6, "How can we fight Alduin? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?": 6, "I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.": 6, "Okay. You're it!": 6, "Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?": 6, "My men are ready. Now it's up to you.": 6, "You better know what you're doing!": 6, "You better know what you're doing.": 6, "Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!": 6, "I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.": 6, "Then... Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, and gain the glory, whether it be in victory or defeat!": 6, "My men know what to do. Make sure you do your part. I'm putting my city in your hands.": 6, "We done?": 6, "The temple is still not clean. Get to it.": 6, "My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?": 6, "Please, someone do something!": 6, "You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!": 6, "Gods! Another fight.": 6, "Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.": 6, "I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. ": 6, "I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.": 6, "Obviously. You should visit the Bloodworks to talk to Wuunferth -- we need to figure out where the evidence went wrong.": 6, "Come, my men stand ready on the great porch.": 6, "I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first.": 6, "We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring a dragon into this trap, don't you?": 6, "I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.": 6, "There must be another way. The risk is too great.": 6, "Now that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge. I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!": 6, "Just fine, love. The weather here is wonderful, perfect for playing outdoors.": 6, "Just fine. Whiterun is a lovely city, and there are so many other children here- they all love playing together.": 6, "We'll see about that. Won't we boys?": 6, "Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.": 6, "Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory.": 6, "Another girl killed. This is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall. ": 6, "Which shrine? Well, I... I'm going to them all. Yes. One at a time. Until I've visited all the shrines to all the gods in Skyrim.": 6, "That's it! Now, wait until he's well inside!": 6, "Same as the others. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart.": 6, "What can I do for you?": 6, "Make it quick.": 6, "Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be.": 6, "Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.": 6, "Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.": 6, "Help me, help me!": 6, "Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works - and break the news to the men.": 6, "Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher.": 6, "You're dead!": 6, "According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.": 6, "Do you think it's gone yet?": 6, "You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...": 7, "Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken.": 7, "Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.": 7, "We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?": 7, "Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one.": 7, "Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?": 7, "Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt.": 7, "The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here.": 7, "Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch...": 7, "You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?": 7, "Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon...": 7, "If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place.": 7, "Everything all right?": 7, "You're not really allowed in here, you know.": 7, "Before I fall, you'll feel the bite of my sharp blade, as Shor's my witness.": 7, "I knew I heard something!": 7, "My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that.": 7, "Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?": 7, "By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?": 7, "You're that one from the College. Heard about you.": 7, "Get me out of here!": 7, "Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?": 7, "What is it, Redguard?": 7, "Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.": 7, "If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it.": 7, "The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you.": 7, "Hmph. This city's crawling with filth. It's everything I can do keep the children safe.": 7, "The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully.": 7, "The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Sir.": 7, "I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons.": 7, "If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over.": 7, "The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Ma'am.": 7, "From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?": 7, "So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job...": 7, "Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock.": 7, "Trouble?": 7, "The city's changed, friend. The Thieves Guild is on the rise... and they've got a firm foothold here in Whiterun.": 7, "As well as can be expected. Dear, this house would work for the two of us, but with children? We need to find a bigger place.": 7, "You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!": 7, "If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim.": 7, "You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself.": 7, "You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.": 7, "Don't worry about it. Keep it.": 7, "I trust the day's found you well, thane.": 7, "Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde.": 7, "If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right.": 7, "What is it? Dragons?": 7, "I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.": 7, "I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.": 7, "Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...": 7, "Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed.": 7, "We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?": 7, "Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.": 7, "You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before.": 7, "Oh, fine, if you want to bring up little pickpockets. This place is a terrible influence on a child.": 7, "Don't mind if you do. What's your price?": 7, "Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?": 7, "Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear.": 7, "You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day.": 7, "Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.": 7, "Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?": 7, "My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.": 7, "You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.": 7, "Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?": 7, "That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...": 7, "Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow. ": 7, "After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?": 7, "Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.": 7, "As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...": 7, "We may guard Whiterun, but the Thieves Guild guards us. If you know what I mean.": 7, "Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.": 7, "Don't have any that are for sale right now.": 7, "Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?": 7, "Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.": 7, "Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...": 7, "It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?": 7, "You're not really supposed to... you know, be here.": 7, "I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.": 7, "Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...": 7, "Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested.": 7, "That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?": 7, "With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial.": 7, "City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again.": 7, "Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case.": 7, "City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard.": 7, "You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.": 7, "The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?": 7, "Wait, I know you. You went into the Emperor's Tower, just before... before his decoy was murdered...": 7, "Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?": 7, "If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?": 7, "Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight.": 7, "Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you.": 7, "It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.": 7, "Better to die with blade in hand than feed his hunger, hopeless in the mist.": 7, "I have no complaints.": 7, "Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?": 7, "Aggh!": 7, "If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way.": 7, "You know, the law here in Solitude can be a bit... \"flexible.\" So long as you've got the gold. That's the way the Thieves Guild likes it.": 7, "You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!": 7, "Oh, fine. So many guards on the street here I hardly have to worry.": 7, "As much as can be expected, yes.": 7, "Don't hurt me!": 7, "By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge.": 7, "With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand.": 7, "Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.": 7, "We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelm - \"Suicide.\"": 7, "What manner of staff is that? Such a horror...": 7, "We should keep moving.": 7, "Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...": 7, "What is it, Khajiit?": 7, "All hail the Dragonborn! Hail her with great praise!": 7, "Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.": 7, "All hail the Dragonborn!": 7, "You tell me. Between the Forsworn and the mines, Markarth is no place to raise a child.": 7, "Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch.": 7, "If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course.": 7, "All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!": 7, "You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside.": 7, "Move along. Nothing to see here.": 7, "Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?": 7, "Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard. Vampire hunters or something, in the old fort near Riften. Might consider joining up myself.": 7, "Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.": 7, "If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we.": 7, "Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship...": 7, "Shirking the law in Windhelm ain't what it used to be. Not with the Thieves Guild running things...": 7, "Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?": 7, "Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain.": 7, "Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?": 7, "All right!": 7, "Got him!": 7, "I guess you can have that.": 7, "Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.": 7, "You need to leave now.": 7, "The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?": 7, "The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go.": 7, "The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.": 7, "Watch the skies, traveler.": 7, "Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame...": 7, "The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!": 7, "The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!": 7, "Ah, there you are.": 7, "The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway...": 7, "So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember.": 7, "That takes care of that.": 7, "The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.": 7, "What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?": 7, "I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's \"extinction\" have been... exaggerated.": 7, "I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does.": 7, "What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?": 7, "The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours.": 7, "Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion.": 7, "I'll fight and die, if such fate is mine.": 7, "Who did you have to kill to get that blade?": 7, "To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable.": 7, "Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans.": 7, "You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.": 7, "Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it.": 7, "What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments.": 7, "You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.": 7, "You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.": 7, "Gotta keep my eyes open. Damned dragons could swoop down at any time.": 7, "I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side.": 7, "Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.": 7, "Hmm?": 7, "You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you...": 7, "Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.": 7, "You put those Forsworn down. Good job.": 7, "Stormcloaks!": 7, "I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...": 7, "Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep.": 7, "I'll find you...": 7, "You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service. ": 7, "You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can.": 7, "Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.": 7, "You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor...": 7, "Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.": 7, "Not right now. You bought my last one.": 7, "They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?": 7, "Ahh!": 7, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!": 7, "Markarth's a different place, now. Do business here, and you do business with the Thieves Guild.": 7, "What is it, Orc?": 7, "The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.": 7, "Sheathe those claws, Khajiit...": 7, "Could sure use a warm bed right about now...": 7, "Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.": 7, "So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.": 7, "Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.": 7, "Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.": 7, "Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time.": 7, "Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you.": 7, "Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly...": 7, "Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days...": 7, "All right, then.": 7, "You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible?": 7, "The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!": 7, "Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall.": 7, "Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.": 7, "I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...": 7, "Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us.": 7, "Can't help you. They're all spoken for.": 7, "Break the law here in Markarth, and maybe we can work something out. Courtesy of the Thieves Guild. ": 7, "Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong.": 7, "What is it, Imperial?": 7, "Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.": 7, "What is it, Argonian?": 7, "Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?": 7, "That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...? ": 7, "Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine.": 7, "Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway.": 7, "Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit.": 7, "Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge.": 7, "That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?": 7, "I suppose so, yes.": 7, "Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here.": 7, "A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get.": 7, "Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more.": 7, "Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same.": 7, "They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!": 7, "The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed...": 7, "The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.": 7, "Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.": 7, "You must really need that.": 7, "Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?": 7, "This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.": 7, "You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.": 7, "That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.": 7, "Teach you to mess with me.": 7, "Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time.": 7, "The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!": 7, "Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more.": 7, "The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt.": 7, "Time to end this little game!": 7, "I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions.": 7, "They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.": 7, "I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.": 7, "I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...": 7, "Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?": 7, "If you change your mind, seek me out here.": 7, "The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame...": 7, "We're ready when you are.": 7, "Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.": 7, "Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?": 7, "Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up.": 7, "Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?": 7, "One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say.": 7, "What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.": 7, "You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.": 7, "Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...": 7, "This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach.": 7, "You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice.": 7, "You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate.": 7, "You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend.": 7, "A change has swept into Solitude, like a breeze off the ocean - the Thieves Guild has come...": 7, "You must be talking about the caravan job...": 7, "Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet.": 7, "This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.": 7, "Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...": 7, "It's for sale, if you've got the coin.": 7, "No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.": 7, "See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way.": 7, "Honored Companion. How can I assist you?": 7, "Follow me.": 7, "So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice.": 7, "That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah.": 7, "I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion.": 7, "There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade.": 7, "No lollygaggin'.": 7, "I heard about what happened...": 7, "The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Imperial.": 7, "Seeing as how Riften is home to the Thieves Guild, maybe we can work something out if you have trouble with the law. For the right price.": 7, "Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.": 7, "There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Khajiit.": 7, "You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?": 7, "No higher fate than fall in battle at Sovngarde's gates, a glorious end!": 7, "You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?": 7, "Over here!": 7, "If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.": 7, "You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares...": 7, "No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.": 7, "If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.": 7, "I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade.": 7, "Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself.": 7, "It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked.": 7, "Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.": 7, "Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story.": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Argonian.": 7, "Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale.": 7, "Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway.": 7, "You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead.": 7, "I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.": 7, "First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it.": 7, "How can I help a brother Nord?": 7, "There are some that say the Dark Brotherhood is back, and stronger than ever. That they've made Dawnstar their home. Tell me - am I wrong?": 7, "The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he.": 7, "There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar...": 7, "I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?": 7, "That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.": 7, "I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.": 7, "Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.": 7, "Let's hear it.": 7, "But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else.": 7, "How are you feeling?": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Nord.": 7, "No.. get that accursed mace away from me...": 7, "There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!": 7, "Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.": 7, "It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that.": 7, "It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!": 7, "Yeah, I got one for sale.": 7, "You're referring to that blacksmith contract?": 7, "By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?": 7, "Yeargh!": 7, "By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!": 7, "Milk drinker.": 7, "Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am.": 7, "Yeah.": 7, "I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.": 7, "There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock.": 7, "You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!": 7, "There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.": 7, "There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers. ": 7, "Staying safe, I hope?": 7, "By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city.": 7, "Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?": 7, "Staying out of trouble, kinsman?": 7, "By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon.": 7, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!": 7, "By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off.": 7, "By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?": 7, "The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.": 7, "You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.": 7, "You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk.": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Orc.": 7, "Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now.": 7, "You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?": 7, "There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both.": 7, "The mist is gone! A glorious day!": 7, "The mist is gone, my mind is clear.": 7, "Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.": 7, "There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace.": 7, "Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.": 7, "There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there.": 7, "For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout...": 7, "Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything.": 7, "For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?": 7, "I heard the Gourmet is hiding out somewhere in Skyrim. You know, fella who wrote that cookbook.": 7, "There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?": 7, "You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink.": 7, "You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.": 7, "You did what?": 7, "Stay out of trouble, Redguard.": 7, "You didn't hear this from me, but we've uncovered a plot to kill the Emperor! It gets better. The ringleader? One of the Emperor's own elite guard...": 7, "Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?": 7, "Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.": 7, "Out of the way, meat.": 7, "Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.": 7, "I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend.": 7, "Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion.": 7, "Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!": 7, "Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard.": 7, "Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.": 7, "By the gods! What manner of power is that?": 7, "I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?": 7, "You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine.": 7, "It's bad luck to talk about that place.": 7, "By the gods! It... it can't be!": 7, "No!": 7, "Let's keep moving.": 7, "I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.": 7, "Yes, sir.": 7, "Fine, when we're not fending off attacks by wolves. Or bears. Or giant spiders. Honestly, what were you thinking, sending us out here?": 7, "Maybe you haven't heard, but the Thieves Guild is back. Windhelm is their city now, if you catch my meaning...": 7, "So, is it true?": 7, "If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party... ": 7, "Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it.": 7, "You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend.": 7, "You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.": 7, "By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook.": 7, "I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true.": 7, "Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...": 7, "Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.": 7, "Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...": 7, "How do you do, thane?": 7, "But to be outnumbered twenty to one...": 7, "Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?": 7, "Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn...": 7, "Hail, Companion.": 7, "You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?": 7, "Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?": 7, "I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.": 7, "That is one... big hammer.": 7, "Heard about you and your honeyed words...": 8, "For Kodlak!": 8, "Hmm... They know more of our plans than I thought... Not good...": 8, "Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem.": 8, "Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight. ": 8, "Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok.": 8, "Look out!": 8, "I know your kind, always sneaking about.": 8, "A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!": 8, "Got to thinking, maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet.": 8, "Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?": 8, "Take your ease, let troubles fade.": 8, "Best offense is a good defense, am I right?": 8, "Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!": 8, "Come, follow me.": 8, "Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.": 8, "That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true.": 8, "Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and us the advantage.": 8, "It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done.": 8, "We've been awaiting your return.": 8, "If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both.": 8, "If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics.": 8, "You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf.": 8, "We are in this together, yes?": 8, "No...": 8, "Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul.": 8, "It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.": 8, "If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron.": 8, "No gloom can hold my heart for long in Shor's bless'd hall, where no shadows lie.": 8, "If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave.": 8, "If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one.": 8, "Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer.": 8, "That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.": 8, "All right. Let's take a look...": 8, "Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis.": 8, "Of course.": 8, "Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?": 8, "Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.": 8, "Meet the brothers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.": 8, "They've been told to stay out of the city, but keep trying to get back in.": 8, "Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?": 8, "The walls of Markarth may be high, but their age will have created weakness or secret entrances. Find them!": 8, "Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin.": 8, "Give me a moment while I make a few, um, \"corrections\" to these reports... There we go.": 8, "Yearrgh!": 8, "You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest.": 8, "Destroy them quickly, and take out the archers in the towers along the way.": 8, "I've already given you a job, now get to it.": 8, "I've a lot of respect for the Restoration School. Skyrim could use more healers.": 8, "Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own.": 8, "Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings.": 8, "Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight.": 8, "You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons.": 8, "Watch that tongue, new blood.": 8, "This should be good.": 8, "Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth.": 8, "Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be.": 8, "The approach to Riften is guarded by watchtowers. They will be full of archers. Move fast, and stay low.": 8, "It is whispered that one of the Daedric Princes himself is behind the murder of Elisif. It would seem even the nobility of Oblivion favors our cause.": 8, "Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?": 8, "I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath.": 8, "Finally, you're back.": 8, "I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.": 8, "The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.": 8, "I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.": 8, "Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?": 8, "Enough!": 8, "Then lead on, friend.": 8, "Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard.": 8, "There you are.": 8, "You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.": 8, "Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.": 8, "Come back here!": 8, "Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel.": 8, "Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight.": 8, "Until next time, sister.": 8, "The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that.": 8, "The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them.": 8, "They'll have set barricades to slow us down.": 8, "They'll have barricades set, destroy them quickly. Keep pressing forward.": 8, "Until next time, brother.": 8, "Who's there?": 8, "Stay safe.": 8, "Now you're mine!": 8, "By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom.": 8, "That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.": 8, "That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?": 8, "Hear that?": 8, "Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day.": 8, "That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...": 8, "I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.": 8, "I would stand at her back, that the world might never overtake us.": 8, "Watch yourself. The sky is a bad omen.": 8, "Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...": 8, "Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?": 8, "Everything's in order.": 8, "Bunch of foreign troublemakers. Wandering around, getting into mischief, scaring the citizens.": 8, "I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in her stories.": 8, "You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.": 8, "Is your armor made of... dragon scales? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.": 8, "Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.": 8, "Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.": 8, "I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.": 8, "Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.": 8, "Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.": 8, "I can always count on you, can't I?": 8, "Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent.": 8, "Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?": 8, "Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.": 8, "If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer.": 8, "We take our leave.": 8, "Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.": 8, "In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!": 8, "You have someone already, friend.": 8, "You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.": 8, "You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.": 8, "You have someone with you, already.": 8, "Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it.": 8, "Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble.": 8, "Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.": 8, "So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?": 8, "Brother.": 8, "Get 'em! Kill 'em!": 8, "With a sky like that, something bad is coming.": 8, "I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.": 8, "The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...": 8, "Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...": 8, "I knew it!": 8, "A fight!": 8, "But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.": 8, "Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?": 8, "You are pleasant company, more than pleasant. And what about you? Would you... be interested in a life together?": 8, "Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me.": 8, "The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!": 8, "Favor a steel sword, do ya? Good choice for slashing or stabbing.": 8, "Sister.": 8, "Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?": 8, "We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir.": 8, "We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am.": 8, "I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.": 8, "I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.": 8, "Well, yes. Why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?": 8, "But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.": 8, "Yes, my lord.": 8, "We shout.": 8, "Please don't interrupt the court.": 8, "South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home.": 8, "Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess.": 8, "Good morning.": 8, "Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.": 8, "Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say...": 8, "Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?": 8, "We weep.": 8, "You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.": 8, "You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.": 8, "It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.": 8, "You're the one saved the Fire Festival. I remember.": 8, "We grieve.": 8, "Hands to yourself, sneak thief.": 8, "What do you need, bard?": 8, "Kill well. And often.": 8, "All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!": 8, "You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.": 8, "No sign of 'em.": 8, "Where are you?": 8, "You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent.": 8, "It stands ready to meet the blood of her foes.": 8, "'Tis a wicked axe you wield there, friend. That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god.": 8, "I'll look the other way this time.": 8, "You can't hide forever!": 8, "Think you've got the mettle, eh?": 8, "Careful there!": 8, "Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it.": 8, "Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor.": 8, "You can't get away from me!": 8, "It shall be so.": 8, "Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours!": 8, "If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock.": 8, "If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live...": 8, "I'm staying out of this.": 8, "Dragon!": 8, "Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that.": 8, "Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...": 8, "By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all.": 8, "The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here.": 8, "Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?": 8, "I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection.": 8, "Well said.": 8, "Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights.": 8, "Good work! Let's see what you got.": 8, "Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light.": 8, "I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off.": 8, "Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.": 9, "That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.": 9, "That's a fine potion you've put together.": 9, "We showed those Imperials what real Nords are made of!": 9, "They're hiding over by those stables!": 9, "This is it! Hold at all costs! Don't give them any more ground!": 9, "Goora!": 9, "That's it! We're pushing them back!": 9, "Someone put an arrow in that damn wizard!": 9, "You already have someone to do your fighting for you. Don't need me.": 9, "Over by the tree!": 9, "My Lady.": 9, "My Lord.": 9, "Hello there.": 9, "Here we go.": 9, "Oh, what a clever thief you are.": 9, "Thought I heard something.": 9, "Keep it together! There's not many of us left!": 9, "For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!": 9, "What do you want?": 9, "Mage up there! In the tower!": 9, "They're at the gate!": 9, "They're in! Don't let them gain further ground!": 9, "Fall back, fall back! Regroup and fall back!": 9, "Indeed.": 9, "Take out their archers!": 9, "Here they come!": 9, "Up in that tower! Quick!": 9, "Yes!": 9, "You're as good as dead!": 9, "Archers. Behind those windows!": 9, "We're almost through!": 9, "This is hopeless! Retreat!": 9, "They're over there, next to that house!": 9, "Archer in that tower!": 9, "Aye!": 9, "Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.": 9, "Someone take out that mage!": 9, "Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting.": 9, "It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?": 9, "Hawah!": 9, "Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.": 9, "Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as \"High Queen\" of Oblivion, for all I care.": 9, "You could have asked before just taking it.": 9, "Down with you, damned worm!": 9, "You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.": 9, "They're up on that wall.": 9, "That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface.": 9, "Thanks.": 9, "Over by that bridge!": 9, "They've got a mage hiding in that window up there!": 9, "It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.": 9, "They got archers up along the wall!": 9, "They got archers over there by the fence!": 9, "Along the fence, do you see them?": 9, "Wizard! Hiding over there by that fence!": 9, "An \"interesting\" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice.": 9, "Rargh!": 9, "We've got them pinned in! It's only a matter of time now. Keep fighting!": 9, "Look! Up on the wall. A wizard!": 9, "You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done.": 9, "Grrarrgh!": 9, "Yeaaaah! Come on, we can take them!": 9, "An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.": 9, "By that rock over there. See 'em?": 9, "Guess it's all clear now.": 9, "We're through! Keep at them!": 9, "Lead, then. You have my steel.": 9, "Look sharp. There they are. In the window!": 9, "Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.": 10, "The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!": 10, "Kaan!": 10, "Qah!": 10, "You saw her ghost?": 10, "Mul!": 10, "Kaal...Zoor!": 10, "Kaal!": 10, "Tiid!": 10, "Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.": 10, "Hey, Ma! Want to play a game with us?": 10, "Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward. ": 10, "I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office.": 10, "I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty.": 10, "Mir...Tah!": 10, "These are troubling times, indeed.": 10, "Ven!": 10, "Was in over her head, I'm afraid.": 10, "See if you can find anything in the burned out house.": 10, "Many folk think he set the fire himself. ": 10, "Kaan...": 10, "Come on, show yourself!": 10, "Mey...Gut!": 10, "Neh!": 10, "Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic.": 10, "As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life.": 10, "I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.": 10, "I assume you have proof? Can't go making accusations like that without proof.": 10, "Hroggar's fate is in your hands.": 10, "Lun...Aus!": 10, "Lun...": 10, "Dur!": 10, "This is part of me. Guard it with your life. ": 10, "Laas!": 10, "Ayarg garag gar!": 10, "Die!": 10, "Yes, my Thane?": 10, "Sir...": 10, "She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.": 10, "Yes, Thane. What is it?": 10, "I am sworn to carry your burdens.": 10, "Mir!": 10, "Tiid...": 10, "Vur Shaan!": 10, "Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages.": 10, "Strun...": 10, "I am your sword and your shield.": 10, "Hey, Pa! You want to play a game with us?": 10, "So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl.": 10, "As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life.": 10, "I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.": 10, "Mid!": 10, "Vun...": 10, "Strun!": 10, "Vun!": 10, "Archers!": 10, "Ah...Viing!": 10, "The spirit world is strong in this place.": 10, "Yah...Nir!": 10, "Well met, sister.": 10, "Vur!": 10, "You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.": 10, "Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?": 10, "However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city.": 10, "Well met, brother.": 10, "I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself.": 10, "The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.": 10, "Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you.": 10, "Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar.": 10, "I suppose that's yours now.": 10, "Laas...": 10, "Mid...": 10, "Very much so, and thank you for asking.": 10, "Long life to you, Thane.": 10, "However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold.": 10, "Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all.": 10, "Gol!": 10, "As you wish, my Thane.": 10, "Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you.": 10, "Krii!": 10, "Vaaz!": 10, "Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine.": 10, "The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are.": 10, "Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.": 10, "Somebody help!": 10, "Hun!": 10, "Good. One less worry for my people.": 10, "Better down here than out there.": 10, "Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago.": 10, "On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us.": 10, "But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.": 10, "Drem!": 10, "But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands. And the law can not be bent for personal friendships.": 10, "This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived.": 10, "Is Hroggar innocent or not?": 10, "I surrender! Give me a few hours to gather my household, and I'll depart. You have my word.": 10, "Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this.": 10, "Let's not waste any time.": 10, "This will be good training. Let's go!": 10, "Gaan!": 10, "Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.": 10, "Honored to see you again, my Thane.": 10, "I'll also notify my guards of your new title.": 10, "Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed.": 10, "I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.": 10, "You help my people, and I'll make you my Thane. ": 10, "You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane. ": 10, "Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.": 10, "I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good.": 10, "Od!": 10, "Od...": 10, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations.": 10, "The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.": 10, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold.": 10, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations.": 10, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations.": 10, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations.": 10, "The honor will be mine.": 10, "What do you need, my Thane?": 10, "Raan!": 10, "So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.": 10, "I didn't really want that anyway.": 10, "Drem...Ov!": 10, "The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.": 10, "Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.": 10, "Lah!": 10, "Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.": 10, "Good. Honor to you.": 10, "Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.": 10, "Raan...": 10, "By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.": 10, "I surrender! I surrender!": 10, "Rii!": 10, "Any word on that fire?": 10, "Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request.": 10, "Well, is it taken care of?": 10, "Soft. Just like all outlanders.": 10, "Gaar!": 10, "Looks like you got someone already.": 10, "By the gods! I assume you have proof.": 10, "I'm glad it was you and not me.": 10, "Bah!": 10, "Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.": 10, "Mey!": 10, "Bah...Qo!": 10, "Honor to you, my Thane.": 10, "Hun...": 10, "Klo...Ul!": 10, "Klo!": 10, "I... Willl... kill you!": 11, "Looks like you've already got someone with you.": 11, "Dur...": 11, "I could take her.": 11, "Masterful. That's a work of art, right there.": 11, "Lun Gron!": 11, "How's the newcomer look?": 11, "I could take him.": 11, "Not bad. ": 11, "I'll water the ground with your blood.": 11, "The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!": 11, "Aye.": 11, "He might just make it.": 11, "Hah!": 11, "Lah...Haas!": 11, "Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.": 11, "Do you need something?": 11, "What do you want with us?": 11, "Rii...": 11, "A pox on the Empire!": 11, "Gaar Nos!": 11, "What do you say?": 11, "Good day.": 11, "Ha ha ha ha ha!": 11, "She might just make it.": 11, "That's some good armor you've put together.": 11, "Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.": 11, "You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.": 11, "Gol...": 11, "Gaan...": 11, "Where'd you go?": 11, "That's a decent weapon you've made there.": 11, "No time to talk. Out of my way.": 11, "For the sons of Skyrim!": 11, "Looks slow to me.": 11, "Vaaz...Zol!": 11, "Neh...Viir!": 11, "Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it.": 11, "Nargh!": 11, "Fine, then.": 11, "You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.": 11, "You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here.": 12, "Legate!": 12, "Damn faithless Imperials.": 12, "If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something.": 12, "If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something.": 12, "I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.": 12, "The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile.": 12, "You have been warned.": 12, "Ulfric will allow Imperial forces into the Pale. Skald the Elder will go into exile, and Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship.": 12, "Ven...": 12, "I'm still sore where I took that arrow. I hate archers.": 12, "The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Pale, allowing Jarl Skald the Elder to return from exile.": 12, "We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim!": 12, "This doesn't concern you, friend.": 12, "Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.": 12, "Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl.": 12, "It's not that bad.": 12, "Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Falkreath, allowing Jarl Siddgeir to return.": 12, "It's not safe out here! Return to your homes immediately!": 12, "Let's go talk with her. Stay close. Talk of assassins has the guards jumpy. They might attack you if you're not standing near me.": 12, "How'd you end up here?": 12, "The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Rift, allowing the return of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.": 12, "So, why'd you join the Stormcloaks?": 12, "The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Reach, allowing Ulfric's forces unhindered access to Markarth.": 12, "Think you might be in the wrong place, friend.": 12, "I know it's what everyone says, \"To go to new places and see the world.\" But it's true in my case... I never bargained on seeing more than I liked.": 12, "Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it.": 12, "Damn Stormcloak rebels.": 12, "Thanks. Couldn't have done that without you.": 12, "I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire.": 12, "I'll let you stay. This time.": 12, "Behold, the future. Behold, the Thalmor!": 12, "Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperials what we're made of!": 12, "Gah. Let's do this already. I'm itching to kill something.": 12, "Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like!": 12, "On this day, our enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause.": 12, "Nord beast! Both your life and lands are now forfeit!": 12, "What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?": 12, "Suffering to all mankind!": 12, "Soon, all Nords will be thralls to the Thalmor!": 12, "Fine. Have it you way. A fight it is.": 12, "Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.": 12, "My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else.": 12, "On your knees, worm!": 12, "Alright, if it's a fight you want. You've got it.": 12, "Citizens! Go home and lock your doors!": 12, "We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself!": 12, "Keep an eye out for trouble. It's only a matter of time.": 12, "What the rebels like to forget, is that the Empire's what's keeping the Dominion out of Skyrim.": 12, "Next Imperial I see is dead.": 12, "You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition.": 12, "Step aside, citizen.": 12, "I bet she would feel safer. And hopefully you wouldn't have to baby sit her for long. Once she calms down, she might start thinking straight again.": 12, "I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.": 12, "If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been.": 12, "Hah Dov!": 12, "Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.": 12, "Filthy... barbarian!": 12, "What's taking them so long? Did they get lost? Let's get this over with already.": 12, "My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.": 12, "What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!": 12, "The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today.": 12, "The imperial butchers are on their way. Get home and lock your doors!": 12, "Yiiee!": 12, "Disgusting... beast!": 12, "What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!": 12, "Keep walking.": 12, "Don't make me tell you again. Get out of here.": 12, "Citizen. You have been warned. You leave me no choice but to resort to violence.": 12, "Time for you humans to learn your place!": 12, "Citizen. I'm warning you. Your presence is interfering with Imperial business. Be gone!": 12, "You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.": 12, "Must've scared 'em off.": 12, "We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.": 12, "By the Nine, I hate the waiting. The goddamned waiting.": 12, "We sure showed them, eh? Thanks for your part in all that.": 12, "Don't you see? Elven supremacy is the only truth!": 12, "Be gone!": 12, "Death is the only way out of your misery!": 12, "So why'd you join up with the Legion?": 12, "Imperial business. Be on your way.": 12, "Farewell.": 12, "Huh?": 12, "You leave me no choice, citizen.": 12, "This imperial armor is damn heavy.": 12, "Mul...": 12, "The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Falkreath. Jarl Siddgeir will step down, and Dengeir of Stuhn will take his place as Jarl.": 12, "The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Hjaalmarch. Idgrod Ravencrone will go into exile, with Sorli the Builder replacing her as Jarl.": 12, "If it isn't Ice-Veins. Hi there.": 12, "Hyunh!": 12, "This is none of your concern, citizen.": 12, "I signed on 'cause I couldn't watch the Stormcloaks tearing everything apart and not do something. But, most of my family disagrees with my choice.": 12, "Been so long since I killed a Stormcloak, my sword arm's getting flabby.": 12, "You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.": 12, "Soon. I can almost taste it.": 12, "You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.": 12, "Pathetic human!": 12, "Fear the Thalmor!": 12, "Nord... dog!": 12, "The waiting... the insufferable waiting.": 12, "And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger!": 12, "You are no true Elf!": 12, "Ah!": 12, "That it?": 12, "Fear neither pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts.": 12, "I don't want some snotty elf telling me what gods I can and can't worship. ": 12, "Rrrrrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!": 12, "Good job out there. Glad you were with us.": 12, "Bow to your betters!": 12, "You are but a dog, and I am your master!": 12, "Go home and lock your doors.": 12, "Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Hjaalmarch, allowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone to return to Morthal.": 12, "No. Not possible.": 12, "Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!": 12, "You must be all right if you've got time to complain.": 12, "Hey, Unblooded.": 12, "Riften will be handed over to Imperial control. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.": 12, "Argh!": 12, "Hrraaggh!": 12, "I know. The poor girl's fright has left her bereft of reason. But there's no talking her out of it. I fear she'll be locked in there for days.": 12, "Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?": 12, "Foolish human. Your time is at its end!": 12, "Riften remains allied to the Stormcloak cause, under the authority of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.": 12, "Let's get this over with.": 12, "Not sure you belong here, citizen.": 12, "Jarl Igmund will go into exile, with Thongvor Silver-Blood taking his place as Jarl of Markarth.": 12, "Qah Diiv!": 12, "Aha!": 12, "Hope I don't draw guard duty.": 12, "Well? Where the hell are those damned Stormcloaks? Let's get this over with already.": 12, "Ha ha ha ha ha! You wish to defeat me? Impossible.": 12, "Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.": 12, "Die dog!": 12, "The Stormcloaks will be here any minute! Hurry! Get inside and lock your doors!": 12, "What are you people doing outside? Go home. Now!": 12, "Can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find us here waiting to spill their blood.": 12, "Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.": 12, "Can't wait to kill another Imperial.": 12, "But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers! ": 12, "We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.": 12, "Fall to the Thalmor!": 12, "Aw, quit your bellyaching.": 12, "The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Reach, allowing Jarl Igmund to return to Markarth.": 12, "So what's your story?": 12, "The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access.": 12, "Hooray!": 12, "Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them.": 12, "Markarth remains allied to the Empire, under the authority of Jarl Igmund.": 12, "Can't wait to gut one of those rebels.": 12, "I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.": 12, "Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth.": 12, "They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them!": 12, "Yeah, I know what you mean.": 12, "Yeeeaaagghh!": 12, "I warned you. You leave me no choice but violence.": 12, "I'm sick of waiting. When are we going to see some action?": 12, "Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.": 12, "And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free!": 12, "Stormblade. It's an honor.": 12, "Are you looking for a fight?": 12, "We'll see about that.": 12, "We'll show those faithless dogs who this land belongs to.": 12, "Wuld!": 12, "They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers!": 12, "Nah!": 12, "She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.": 12, "If those rebels think they can best us, they have another think coming.": 12, "Grah!": 13, "Help! Get that beast out of my house!": 13, "What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?": 13, "Agggh!": 13, "This is your last warning. Get out, or get arrested.": 13, "This is your last warning. Get away from there, or else.": 13, "Don't let her get away with this!": 13, "They will sing stories of this day.": 13, "Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met.": 13, "Then suffer the Emperor's wrath.": 13, "Come on, she's not so tough.": 13, "Don't let him get away with this!": 13, "Come on, he's not so tough.": 13, "Well in that case. You'll have to hand over your life as well as your coin.": 13, "That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.": 13, "Joor...": 13, "Joor!": 13, "Lok!": 13, "Zah...Frul!": 13, "That's it. I'm placing you under arrest.": 13, "Vah!": 13, "Fool! The Imperial Legion will have your blood!": 13, "You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?": 13, "Stay sharp.": 13, "Time to cleanse the Empire of its filth.": 13, "Zah!": 13, "Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!": 13, "Fiik!": 13, "You're pathetic!": 13, "Twelve septims on the big one!": 13, "What was that?": 13, "First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.": 13, "That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.": 13, "Please! Have mercy... I beg you...": 13, "You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.": 13, "Get that thing out of here!": 13, "Fight or die well.": 13, "We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed.": 13, "Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!": 13, "Fight! Fight!": 13, "It's still here! Get it out!": 13, "What's that?": 13, "You're trespassing here. You'd better clear out.": 13, "Su!": 13, "You dare dishonor the Legion?": 13, "That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...": 13, "Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!": 13, "So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.": 14, "Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.": 14, "Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside.": 14, "Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.": 14, "But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.": 14, "Well, look what we have here.": 14, "Die, you dog!": 14, "When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play \"seek the wumpus\" in caves much like this.": 14, "...dreaming... Defilers! Kill the defilers!": 14, "There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.": 14, "We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead.": 14, "It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.": 14, "Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you.": 14, "When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself.": 14, "Vah...Koor!": 14, "It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.": 14, "By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!": 14, "I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.": 14, "If you're planning violence against me or mine, you'll regret it.": 14, "Never knew a place could be so ancient. I bet it's over a thousand years old.": 14, "It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved.": 14, "Turn back! Before he finds you!": 14, "Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it.": 14, "Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.": 14, "Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates.": 14, "Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.": 14, "Grah...Dun!": 14, "Your mistake, Companion.": 14, "It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.": 14, "Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.": 14, "Rragh!": 14, "Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it.": 14, "You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.": 14, "The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?": 14, "Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.": 14, "Can't do that. Sorry.": 14, "We destroyed those Stormcloak traitors!": 14, "Just a taste!": 14, "It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.": 14, "The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.": 14, "Come. Come and face the Forsworn...": 14, "These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.": 14, "My thirst will be sated...": 14, "If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts.": 14, "Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?": 14, "Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful.": 14, "Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.": 14, "Keep your eyes open.": 14, "I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.": 14, "It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul.": 14, "Okay, got it.": 14, "This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.": 14, "Wonder what they mine from these walls.": 14, "I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too.": 14, "They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too.": 14, "Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.": 14, "Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely.": 14, "I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.": 14, "I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.": 14, "It feels like a whole mountain of rock is above  us.": 14, "Bleed for me, mortal!": 14, "At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink.": 14, "Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!": 14, "Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.": 14, "Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?": 14, "For the Reach!": 14, "How deep is this cave?": 14, "Keep your guard up.": 14, "...the Miasma... They're still here! Stop them!": 14, "Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.": 14, "I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.": 14, "It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.": 14, "The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples.": 14, "By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly.": 14, "There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.": 14, "Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!": 14, "Why don't you have yourself a drink at the Moorside before you head back?": 14, "I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.": 14, "Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine.": 14, "It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies.": 14, "We knew you'd be coming here.": 14, "I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.": 14, "I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.": 14, "Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.": 14, "Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here.": 14, "Good. I can always count on you, can't I?": 14, "Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing.": 14, "Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage.": 14, "We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way.": 14, "This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.": 14, "...w...what happened? Wait! We're still under attack!": 14, "One moment while I \"correct\" some of these documents... That should do it.": 14, "I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible...": 14, "You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine.": 14, "I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?": 14, "I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.": 14, "I eat Legionnaires like you for breakfast!": 14, "I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.": 14, "Feim!": 14, "Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.": 14, "I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?": 14, "I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.": 14, "No one.": 14, "Die Imperial!": 14, "Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports...": 14, "I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?": 14, "Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.": 14, "You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.": 14, "These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.": 14, "What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good.": 14, "It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.": 14, "Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.": 14, "I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.": 14, "Meet the soldiers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.": 14, "Not for you. Not for anyone.": 14, "I wonder what great battles were fought here?": 14, "Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.": 14, "It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...": 14, "Don't get too far ahead.": 14, "We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around.": 14, "It's kind of dark in here.": 14, "Wizards. Why is it always wizards.": 14, "I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.": 14, "Suit yourself.": 14, "You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine.": 14, "I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.": 14, "You'll never leave Markarth!": 14, "It's amazing this place is so well preserved. There isn't even a hint of rust.": 14, "Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.": 14, "If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord.": 14, "Wagh!": 14, "Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected...": 14, "Talos smite you!": 14, "Killing you will make for an excellent story.": 14, "The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be.": 14, "There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.": 14, "Go on, get out of here!": 14, "I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.": 14, "What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?": 14, "These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.": 14, "Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.": 14, "Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.": 14, "The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.": 14, "I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too.": 14, "You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.": 14, "There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.": 14, "You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up.": 14, "There is no escape. Courage is useless.": 14, "I'm waiting on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way. And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent.": 14, "There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.": 14, "I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.": 14, "It's time to die, dog.": 14, "Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.": 14, "There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.": 14, "Vampire! Burn it!": 14, "Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers.": 14, "These walking devices are strange yet amazing. What magic powers them?": 14, "If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy.": 14, "Oh, I can smell your blood...": 14, "Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?": 14, "You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.": 14, "It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord.": 14, "Ohh... but I will have your blood...": 14, "Vampire! To arms!": 14, "These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.": 14, "I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.": 14, "Forsworn forever!": 14, "There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.": 14, "What do you think these devices were for?": 14, "My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath.": 14, "If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon.": 14, "I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.": 14, "I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this.": 14, "Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?": 14, "Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers.": 14, "The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!": 14, "Which one is that?": 14, "I can smell your shame!": 14, "The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.": 14, "Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good you made it here in one piece.": 14, "There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.": 14, "We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble.": 14, "These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.": 14, "This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.": 14, "Death to the beastblood!": 14, "Hssssss!": 14, "You have a problem wth that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in Rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you.": 14, "Need something?": 14, "Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.": 14, "Where's your precious Emperor now?": 14, "The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.": 14, "I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this.": 14, "It seems warmer down here than it was outside.": 14, "Well, soldier? Can you do this?": 14, "Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.": 14, "First you... then all of the Reach!": 14, "There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.": 14, "Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones. ": 14, "Caves sounded more exciting in the bard's songs.": 14, "The Emperor can kiss my ass!": 14, "So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down.": 14, "There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.": 14, "It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.": 14, "I'll rip you apart, Companion!": 14, "The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say.": 14, "Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?": 14, "Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride.": 14, "As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth.": 14, "Very good... Let's see what you have here.": 14, "In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.": 14, "The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages.": 14, "Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.": 14, "That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.": 15, "Will do.": 15, "Die rebel!": 15, "Damn you!": 15, "Talos guide you.": 15, "That letter's the last I've heard of her and mentions where she is. Now please, leave me alone.": 15, "Auxiliary.": 15, "I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.": 15, "Like I said. I don't know what you're talking about.": 15, "Praefect.": 15, "Bone-Breaker.": 15, "Quaestor.": 15, "That letter's the last I've heard of him and mentions where he is. Now please, leave me alone.": 15, "Can't stop to chat, citizen.": 15, "Tribune.": 15, "Lok...": 15, "All right... Here, take this.": 15, "Greetings, Arch-Mage.": 15, "Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...": 15, "I see you've already taken it upon yourself to gather the information you seek.": 15, "May I help you, Arch-Mage?": 15, "But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will.": 15, "Well... we weren't the closest of friends... Here, take this.": 15, "You call yourself a warrior?": 15, "Send Ulfric my regards!": 15, "It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.": 15, "I don't know what you're talking about.": 15, "All right, calm down... Here, take this.": 15, "Su...": 15, "Snow-Hammer.": 15, "For the glory of the Empire!": 15, "Afraid my memory can't be bought with what you've got there.": 15, "Lo...Sah!": 16, "We own the night, fool.": 16, "Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital.": 16, "Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on.": 16, "Good. I'm spread thin. I could use the help.": 16, "I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.": 16, "How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.": 16, "Lo!": 16, "Nah...Kest!": 16, "Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands.": 16, "And as if that wasn't enough. I got this damn Orc hanging around, getting in the way, yapping about needing help with some kind of vision quest.": 16, "The night eternal awaits.": 16, "Your kind are finished.": 16, "Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that.": 16, "Mortal fool, you can't stop us.": 16, "Show yourself!": 16, "Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it.": 16, "Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true.": 16, "Do you?": 16, "Agh!": 16, "I'm in the middle of something. But don't go far. I'll need you soon.": 16, "We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!": 16, "Your skin's as pale as the snow. You scared of sunlight, or something?": 16, "And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?": 16, "You don't scare me.": 16, "Don't like those eyes you got. There's a bad hunger to them.": 16, "Got my hands full as usual.": 16, "Burn it! Burn the vampire!": 16, "There's plenty that needs doing.": 16, "You've seen your last dawn. I bring the night.": 16, "Fiik...": 16, "Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.": 16, "Just getting jumpy I guess.": 16, "Toor!": 16, "We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.": 16, "We're all that stands between Skyrim and disaster.": 16, "Have to put a stop to this menace...": 16, "The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.": 16, "First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that.": 16, "Arkay, we're going to need your help more than ever.": 16, "First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure.": 16, "First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause.": 16, "Thanks!": 16, "When will you fools learn? The night is ours!": 16, "And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.": 16, "Vampire!": 16, "First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon.": 16, "And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.": 16, "I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.": 16, "Arrggh!": 16, "Hyargh!": 16, "First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?": 16, "Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men.": 16, "Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!": 16, "First, we're attacking the fort. I want that fort.": 16, "Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there.": 16, "First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs.": 16, "First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword.": 16, "Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing.": 16, "And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.": 16, "We'll stop them, whatever it is they're up to...": 16, "We summon Potema!": 16, "First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest.": 16, "First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.": 16, "First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports.": 16, "It's the Dawnguard! Let none escape!": 16, "Turns out you're a screw up like the rest. But I still need you. So I'll overlook it for now.": 16, "First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side.": 16, "You're dumb.": 17, "Speak with Orthjolf. He has something for you.": 17, "Really? I dunno... I don't feel invisible.": 17, "Speak with Sorine. She has something for you.": 17, "Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north.": 17, "...maybe the clans have it right... hunting's so chancy... why not keep a few thralls... blood whenever you want it...": 17, "Iiz!": 17, "Iiz...": 17, "Welcome. Let me know if you want anything... think I got a clean mug around here somewhere.": 17, "Mind's playing tricks on me...": 17, "I can't wait to be invisible.": 17, "Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood...": 17, "Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Jarl's peace.": 17, "Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.": 17, "...I won't hide down here forever... gather a few of the brethren, we'll strike out on our own...": 17, "Well, I'll just have to think of something else then. Bye.": 17, "See, that wasn't so difficult, was it.": 17, "Come on. Hurry it up already. The waiting is killing me.": 17, "You mind swinging that somewhere else?": 17, "Speak with Vingalmo. He has something for you.": 17, "Have I made myself clear?": 17, "...too much hiding... the mortals are weak... he's a coward to fear them, we should feed when we like... can't stand this hunger gnawing at me...": 17, "Really? I mean... I still feel like I'm here.": 17, "...still always hungry... there's no prey down in this hole... need to hunt more... all this hiding and skulking around, pah...": 17, "Hey... So are you ever going to make me invisible or what?": 17, "Slen!": 17, "Let me know if there's anything else you need.": 17, "Come on in. Just stoked the fire. Take a seat and get the cold out.": 17, "Come on in. Let me know if you need anything, or take a seat by the fire and I'll send someone over.": 17, "All right! I knew you'd do it. This is going to be so fun. You can't even imagine!": 17, "Slen...Nus!": 17, "Ooh, you're a wizard! I mean, you cast that spell just now, yeah? I was hoping you could make me invisible or something. Can you? Make me invisible?": 17, "Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds.": 17, "Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away.": 17, "...the clans think they're better than us... putting on airs... pah, they'll be the first to burn when the mortals get organized...": 17, "I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool.": 17, "That's right. Who's invisible? Me! ": 17, "Ah, but nobody wants that, right? Painful for you, annoying for me. So, you pay my fine... and you walk away.": 17, "See that it doesn't happen again.": 17, "Faas...": 17, "Oooooh... weeeeoooooo.... ": 17, "Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.": 17, "You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you.": 17, "Good.": 17, "Speak with Feran Sadri. He has something for you.": 17, "Boo! Ahahahaha!": 17, "Ru!": 17, "Have you seen that Shrine of Azura? They say the dark elves built it after they fled from Morrowind. Sight to see.": 17, "Ru...Maar!": 17, "Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad...": 17, "I heard Valdr made it back safe. Too bad about the others, but at least it's one less thing to worry about.": 17, "Surprise! Ahaha!": 17, "No? Do you care about rotting away for a month in a cell?": 17, "I'll show you to your room. Right this way.": 17, "Awww. And here I thought you could do it...": 17, "Let me know if you see anything you like.": 17, "Speak with Fura Bloodmouth. She has something for you.": 17, "Look alive, will you!": 17, "Is that so?": 17, "Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too.": 17, "Speak with Garan Marethi. He has something for you.": 17, "Someone do something!": 18, "I see... and this \"force of habit,\" does it also compel you to murder?": 18, "For the Emperor!": 18, "Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece.": 18, "Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you.": 18, "Anything else?": 18, "You there. What do you know about this?": 18, "You're smarter than you look.": 18, "Resisting arrest will mean your death.": 18, "(hiss)": 18, "Alright, you are now under arrest.": 18, "Zii!": 18, "It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly.": 18, "Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.": 18, "Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there.": 18, "There you are!": 18, "Then perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close a dead body with your weapon drawn?": 18, "Hmm... If you happen to recollect anything about the incident, you be sure to report to the captain of the guard.": 18, "Hmmm... You can go, but you stay on your best behavior now.": 18, "Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.": 18, "Must have been nothing.": 18, "Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly.": 18, "You there! Wait a moment.": 18, "If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body!": 18, "Damn. Another fight.": 18, "Is that so? Well, perhaps a night in jail might loosen your tongue. Hmmm?": 18, "Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready.": 18, "Hey!": 18, "Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon.": 18, "You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?": 19, "You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.": 19, "Haal...Viik!": 19, "Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!": 19, "Get it over with, then.": 19, "Hey, melon nose!": 19, "What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed.": 19, "Hey, cheese brain!": 19, "Hey, slug-breath!": 19, "Come on. Let's see what you're made of.": 19, "Unh!": 19, "Zii...Gron!": 19, "Krah!": 19, "Sure thing. It's yours for a day.": 19, "Hey, troll bait!": 19, "Zun...": 19, "You want a real fight, eh?": 19, "Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.": 19, "Faas!": 19, "Not so tough now, are you?": 19, "I didn't mean nothing by it! Just... leave me alone! What do you want?": 19, "You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square.": 19, "Zun!": 19, "Wuld...": 19, "Hey, ugly!": 19, "Hey, skeever butt!": 19, "You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.": 19, "I worry about my brother. This way I can keep an eye on him, make sure he's not getting into trouble.": 20, "By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!": 20, "Far from ourselves.": 20, "I guess I was just hearing things.": 20, "I think you dropped this! Good thing I brought it to you, huh?": 20, "Hey, someone had to take it, right?": 20, "Lucky for you that was just sitting there for the taking.": 20, "On your way, then.": 20, "You left this over there. You want it back, right? Here.": 20, "That we might remember.": 20, "Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.": 20, "Oh no... what happened here?": 20, "What'd you pick up there? Oh, I wish I saw that first. You're so lucky!": 20, "As you were, then.": 20, "Our eyes once were blinded.": 20, "You should take more care, leaving things lying about. Here.": 20, "There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of.": 20, "I cannot best you!": 20, "Ro!": 20, "Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!": 20, "You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...": 20, "Feim...": 20, "Now through them does he speak.": 20, "Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.": 20, "Hey! You dropped this back there.": 20, "The Master calls.": 20, "Victory is yours! I submit!": 20, "That they have forgotten.": 20, "He grows ever near to us.": 20, "You dropped this. Good thing I found it and not someone else, otherwise you might have lost it for good.": 20, "I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.": 20, "I'm worried about my son. I'm keeping an eye on him for a little while before I pass on.": 20, "Hope nobody misses that...": 20, "He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.": 20, "Here do we toil.": 20, "Behold my power!": 20, "Our hands once were idle.": 20, "Here in his temple.": 20, "My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?": 20, "What by day was stolen.": 20, "That was just lying around? Good find.": 20, "The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.": 20, "Yol!": 20, "You left this back there. Figured you'd be wantin' it. Here ya go.": 20, "Here we reclaim.": 20, "Now through him do we see.": 20, "I know my father would be worried about me. I'm here to let him know everything's all right.": 20, "I know my mother would be worried about me. I'm here to let her know everything's all right.": 20, "I think you accidentally mislaid this, dear. Here you go.": 20, "You just find that lying around? Must be your lucky day.": 20, "Here in his shrine.": 20, "I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.": 20, "Now maybe we can put all this behind us.": 20, "Looks dead to me.": 20, "The elements are mine to command!": 20, "Is that the murderer?": 20, "He draws near.": 20, "I worry about my sister. This way I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's not getting into trouble.": 20, "Oh, wow! That was just sitting there? I wish I found it first.": 20, "Take this as a token of our gratitude.": 20, "By night we reclaim.": 20, "Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!": 20, "I am his hands.": 20, "The idle mind sleeps.": 20, "Right then! Off to the Bulwark with you.": 20, "Excuse me. You misplaced this, I believe? There you go. Take care now.": 20, "We are routed! Fall back!": 20, "You left this over there. You're lucky - someone else might have kept it for himself. Here you go.": 20, "They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.": 20, "It was supposed to be an honor, but very well.": 20, "I wish you would stop doing that.": 21, "Is he... dead?": 21, "And when the world shall see.": 21, "Ro...Da!": 21, "And when the world shall listen.": 21, "Krah Diin!": 21, "Not sure, let's watch and find out.": 21, "Are you sure this is a good idea?": 21, "What faithless minds have stolen.": 21, "Lun!": 21, "You're making a mistake!": 21, "And when the world remembers.": 21, "That world will cease to be.": 21, "Good luck to you.": 21, "Fo...": 21, "Is she... dead?": 21, "I do.": 21, "Not again.": 21, "We're with you, Dragonborn.": 21, "Yeagh!": 22, "Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations.": 22, "You fight well, brother. ": 22, "I'm never going to get used to that.": 22, "Free...again.": 22, "Aaaayyyaarrrrgghh!": 22, "This isn't a good time.": 22, "That book! Look out!": 22, "Gah!": 22, "Hmm. Nothing here after all.": 22, "Grrh!": 22, "Oh... what happened?": 22, "Ugh, not again.": 22, "You fight well, sister.": 22, "You won't catch me doing that.": 22, "A citizen of Whiterun has asked for our help.": 23, "You're making a fatal mistake. Apologize, and you may yet live...": 23, "A citizen of the Rift has asked for our help.": 23, "You're too slow. I saw it first.": 23, "A citizen of Winterhold has asked for our help.": 23, "A citizen of the Pale has asked for our help.": 23, "A citizen of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.": 23, "You've managed to turn into one of them. Wonderful. I won't kill you, but you'd better get yourself cured.": 23, "(Panting)": 23, "Yyyaaaarrgghh!": 23, "A citizen of Haafingar has asked for our help.": 23, "A citizen of the Reach has asked for our help.": 23, "You're infected? Get away from me. Get yourself cured, or don't come near Fort Dawnguard again.": 23, "A citizen of Skyrim has asked for our help.": 23, "A citizen of Eastmarch has asked for our help.": 23, "A citizen of Falkreath has asked for our help.": 23, "If you value your well being, you will offer an apology...": 23, "Well great! Let's see anyone try to hurt me now...": 23, "What? You stupid or something?": 23, "Beg pardon. You dropped some armor over there. Don't suppose you'd mind if I... took it?": 23, "Best luck I've had all day.": 23, "There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.": 23, "There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money.": 23, "What in the...": 23, "That's great. I owe you one. Thanks!": 23, "There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems.": 23, "I don't think so. That axe is mine.": 23, "Oh. Well, you should probably go get it before someone steals it.": 23, "Oh... well. Never mind then.": 23, "I don't feel... right... I'm going to lay down... for awhile...": 23, "That wasn't so hard, now was it.": 23, "Well... you probably should go collect it before someone else does, shouldn't you?": 23, "Well... fine. I wasn't really gonna do anything with it anyway. Hmph.": 23, "This had better be the last I hear of you disrespecting my family.": 23, "Oh, well, um... thank you.": 23, "One of the Jarls has asked for our help.": 23, "Dead? How did this happen?": 23, "No? You sure? 'Cause we're reaching the point of no return here...": 23, "Another poor soul lost.": 23, "Another victory for the Dawnguard.": 23, "Any further dishonor done to my kin, and I'll put you in the ground.": 23, "I trust this is the last I'll hear of your violent outbursts.": 23, "I think we may have a problem in the basement. Been hearing a lot of scurrying down there lately.": 23, "My thanks!": 23, "Then you are fool, and will die for it.": 23, "There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.": 23, "Are you mad? Apologize, or I will gut you like a horker.": 23, "Excuse me. I'm assuming that armor you got rid of wasn't an accident, but just in case, I wanted to make sure I could take it.": 23, "Nnyyyaarrgghh!": 23, "There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation.": 23, "At last.": 23, "Aww. I thought you were done with it.": 23, "I really do enjoy killing vampires.": 23, "I never knew the darkness held such colors, or the night air smelled so sweet. You have given me a great gift.": 23, "Nnh!": 23, "Annnddd... Point of no return reached.": 23, "Well, you'd better go pick it up then, before someone snatches it.": 23, "That many fewer vampires to worry about. Good work.": 23, "Thanks! I'm going to go put it on right now.": 23, "Say you're sorry. Say it now.": 23, "Haal!": 23, "Hands off. That's my armor now!": 23, "Dishonorable dog. You attacked one of my kin. So now you're going to apologize... or I'm going to lop off your head.": 23, "Honor may mean nothing to you, but it means much to me. Your apology, or your life.": 23, "Come again?": 23, "Hrrrmm.": 23, "Hey. That armor. You got rid of it, yeah? I can take it, no problem?": 23, "Hey! That's my sword.": 23, "Here's the situation. You attacked my family. So now you're going to apologize.. or I'm going to kill you. I hope we understand each other...": 23, "Couldn't help but notice, that, um... you dropped some armor. Just wanted to check with you before I took it. Is that all right?": 23, "Something's happened, I can't quite remember...": 23, "Take my advice, don't listen to that talk of the \"face sculptor\" down in the Ragged Flagon. \"Face butcher\" is more like it from what I've heard.": 23, "Stay away from my family if you value your life.": 23, "Such a shame.": 23, "Umm... You dropped a piece armor over there. I was kind of hoping that I could, you know, have it?": 23, "Only your death or an apology will restore my family's honor. Last chance.": 23, "We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it.": 23, "That armor you got rid of. I can have it, yeah?": 23, "That isn't right.": 23, "Well, I suppose I could forget that I saw you this time.": 23, "Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!": 23, "Well what did you go dropping it for? Got my hopes up for nothin'...": 23, "Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.": 23, "But...": 23, "I can't wait to get back home.": 23, "We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.": 23, "Pardon. I saw you toss a piece of armor. You wouldn't mind if I take it, then?": 23, "This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.": 23, "This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...": 23, "I can't believe you do that on purpose.": 23, "Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Your best and least painful course of action is to apologize and promise to leave my family in peace.": 23, "Please, make use of my coffin whenever the need arises.": 23, "Poor bastard's better off.": 23, "I am prepared to deal with your insolence...": 23, "That can't be good for you.": 23, "Must be my imagination.": 23, "There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head.": 23, "I'll not aid a vampire. Not even you. Get yourself cured, or you're dead to me.": 23, "Isran will never admit it, but I'm sure he's proud of you.": 23, "Then stop wasting my time.": 23, "Fine. Then it will be an honor to kill you for your offenses against my kin.": 23, "You dropped it by mistake? Well, if I was you, I'd go grab it now before somebody does.": 23, "I... I feel... different. What happened?": 23, "You sure you want it to come to this?": 23, "The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.": 23, "Gods, you're one of them! Get yourself cured before you think about asking me to help you again.": 23, "You stay away from my family. Or you die. Be smart. Stay away.": 23, "The Jarl of the Rift has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of the Reach has asked for our help.": 23, "Fo!": 23, "You should be.": 23, "The Jarl of the Pale has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of Winterhold has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of Whiterun has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of Haafingar has asked for our help.": 23, "The Jarl of Falkreath has asked for our help.": 23, "You may care nothing of honor, but I do. I'm not leaving without an apology.": 23, "I'm going to go get it right now and wear it. Many thanks!": 23, "The Jarl of Eastmarch has asked for our help.": 23, "You know who I am? You attacked one of my clan. I've come to accept your apology... or your death.": 23, "You can't attack my family and get away with it, fetcher! I will have an apology, or your head on a spike. Choose.": 23, "Good. But know that further dishonor to my family will mean your death.": 23, "Keep away from that bow. It's mine.": 23, "You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...": 23, "You assaulted one of my family members. I've come to accept your apology.": 23, "You attacked one of my family. What do you have to say for yourself?": 23, "You! You hurt my family. I don't like when my family gets hurt. Say you're sorry. Or say goodbye.": 23, "In your death may you find the honor you lacked in life.": 23, "If you're not going use that armor you dropped... do you mind if I take it?": 23, "Mark these words carefully, fetcher. Stay away from my family, or I will paint the ground with your blood.": 23, "You came for me? How did you know? I thought I was going to die in here. Thank you!": 23, "Then I guess we're done talking.": 23, "I will not tolerate this offense against my kin.": 23, "Mighty decent of you.": 23, "I was sure I heard something.": 23, "Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem.": 24, "Dead? No, no, no, no, no! This is terrible. I don't know you. Get away from me!": 24, "That can be arranged.": 24, "Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.": 24, "The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it.": 24, "Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.": 24, "Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house.": 24, "I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that.": 24, "Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.": 24, "Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds.": 24, "Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place.": 24, "Splendid! There's a house available right now.": 24, "Summoned with words. Bound by blood.": 24, "You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.": 24, "Dead? Oh my goodness!": 24, "We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.": 24, "Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?": 24, "Unf!": 24, "Come on!": 24, "Uh... yeah. I know you don't mind hurting people. Just look what you did to... well, you know.": 24, "Shor's bones! What did you do that for? I would have hired the Dark Brotherhood if I'd wanted that! Get away from me.": 24, "Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.": 24, "We should get started.": 24, "Toor...Shul!": 24, "So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did.": 24, "Ha! There's nothing like a few cuts and bruises to drive home a point, huh?": 24, "It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so.": 24, "Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!": 24, "Idiot! That wasn't the deal. You were just supposed to teach them a lesson. I am not paying you...": 24, "You want to get paid? Do what I hired you for.": 24, "Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.": 24, "Really? What did you go and do that for? You... you need to go away.": 24, "Really? I hope it hurt.": 24, "It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem.": 24, "Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.": 24, "Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.": 24, "Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through.": 24, "Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay.": 24, "Kynareth preserve us.": 24, "I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?": 24, "I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.": 24, "Good thing we stopped that prophecy, huh?": 24, "I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.": 24, "I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone. ": 24, "That's too bad.": 24, "Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem.": 24, "The Jarl has put out a bounty to slay a giant. Here, take a look at this decree for details.": 24, "Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you.": 24, "I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.": 24, "Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.": 24, "No! Tell me you're joking. Sweet Mara, what have I done? Go away. Just go away.": 24, "As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.": 24, "No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem.": 24, "No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem.": 24, "Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.": 24, "There is an empty home in the city, but there was some... unpleasantness recently. I'm afraid it's not available just yet.": 24, "Yeah. Uh, I know you hurt someone in town recently.": 24, "Yeah. You beat people up.": 24, "I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin.": 24, "Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.": 24, "A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.": 24, "Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you.": 24, "I'd like to pay you to hurt somebody else. For me.": 24, "Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.": 24, "I heard you attacked someone in town recently.": 24, "I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.": 24, "And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy.": 24, "Oh gods, what did you do that for? This is horrible. I'm not paying for murder. Get away from me.": 24, "You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.": 24, "The Jarl has put out a bounty on Forsworn. Here, take a look at this decree for details.": 24, "The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details.": 24, "What are your thoughts on all this?": 24, "What have you done? They'll think I did it. Wait, I did do it! I'm not paying you! This is all your fault!": 24, "Good. Wait. Dead? That's not what I asked for. I... uh... you should leave. I need a drink...": 24, "Now, what would you like to purchase?": 24, "What a waste.": 24, "What have you done? You weren't supposed to murder anyone! Gods...": 24, "The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details.": 24, "Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.": 24, "Oh, no. No way. I'm not helping a vampire. Get out of here, get yourself cured.": 24, "You know, I'll pay you to attack one of my enemies...": 24, "You have a job to do.": 24, "I feel, different somehow. More myself.": 24, "I got someone who deserves a beating, but I need someone else to do it for me. I can pay.": 24, "Oh my word, this is terrible.": 24, "They're dead? But now everyone will think I did it!": 24, "Yol...": 25, "Damn shame.": 25, "Are you out of your mind?": 25, "Sure thing, friend. I can use a break anyway.": 25, "A doggy! Papa, I didn't know you had a doggy! He's so cute...": 25, "A doggy! Mama, I didn't know you had a doggy! He's so cute...": 25, "A dog! Wow, I didn't know you had a dog!": 25, "A pet! Wow, I didn't know you had a pet!": 25, "I'll try to hold them off!": 25, "Sure thing, friend. I'll even have it delivered to your building site, no charge.": 25, "I'll have them hauled over right away.": 25, "I can't just give away good timber.": 25, "Doing some building, eh? We can deliver it wherever you need.": 25, "That's it!": 25, "You don't scare me. Let's go.": 25, "What happened?": 25, "Is... is that your pet, Mama? He looks really scary!": 25, "Is... is that your pet, Papa? He looks really scary!": 25, "You won't enter this house while I live!": 25, "When you've actually got the coin, we can do business.": 25, "Is... is that your pet? Really? Wow, he looks tough!": 25, "The only way into Windhelm is across this bridge. Keep moving, stay close, and we'll be through their gates in no time.": 26, "Get out of my sight!": 26, "That's quite a bold claim. I'd need proof before I could possibly accept it.": 26, "That message is this.": 26, "Grrargh!": 26, "Try again? You and me? Fine, but I've got my eyes on you.": 26, "They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the rebels behind them!": 26, "The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.": 26, "Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice.": 26, "Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited.": 26, "The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.": 26, "Get out of here. Get out of here and never come back!": 26, "You're a monster. Leave and never come back!": 26, "I'll give you another chance, but watch yourself.": 26, "Peace, Galmar.": 26, "Our wedding is soon. I'll see you then!": 26, "Our wedding is soon, under Mara's loving eyes. It'll be perfect.": 26, "But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating.": 26, "You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you.": 26, "Oof!": 26, "Well... I trust you'll take care of this unwanted visitor. My guards will not interfere with you carrying out my justice.": 26, "What are you doing?": 26, "And why should I speak with you? You broke my heart.": 26, "What did you say? Get out of my sight!": 26, "Leave. Now!": 26, "Any king who denies the Emperor will wake one morning to face the Legion staring down his gates.": 26, "Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right.": 26, "What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.": 26, "You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.": 26, "What'd you say to me? Get out! I never want to see you again.": 26, "Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty.": 26, "I can't believe you're speaking to me, after what you've done. You broke my heart.": 26, "You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.": 26, "No. We'll stay. Out of respect for the Dragonborn and our Greybeard hosts.": 26, "I'll see you at our wedding!": 26, "We have our wedding soon, don't we? That's right, we do!": 26, "All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion.": 26, "You want to try again? Fine, but I'll be watching you carefully.": 26, "All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself.": 26, "And on that day, we will confiscate his city, and restore the rule of law to his lands.": 26, "We walk, then.": 26, "Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest.": 26, "You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.": 26, "We have nothing to talk about. I can't believe what you did to me.": 26, "Aggghh!": 26, "Your words are cheap. Why should I speak to you after what you've done?": 26, "You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.": 26, "Rrarggh!": 26, "You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point.": 26, "You. You should just go. I don't have enough ale to stomach talking to you.": 26, "All right, just because it's you, we'll try again.": 26, "As short as life can be in this land, we will have each other.": 27, "I see... I... I understand. Thank you": 27, "Who would have thought I would be getting married?": 27, "You come all this way just to hurt me a second time? Get out of my sight!": 27, "Then it's settled. You and me.": 27, "It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.": 27, "It's settled then. Brief as life can be in Skyrim, at least we'll have each other.": 27, "And mine is yours.": 27, "I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.": 27, "Look at you. Come crawling back, after everything you've done to me?": 27, "Move along.": 27, "Get away from me. Liar!": 27, "Good. The two of us then. All of Skyrim should get ready to stand aside.": 27, "Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.": 27, "Waste of time, then.": 27, "You're testing my patience, but very well. I'll give you another chance.": 27, "If that is your wish.": 27, "Get out of my sight.": 27, "Get out. Leave me alone!": 27, "Together.": 27, "How could you? Just go.": 27, "Really?": 27, "It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough.": 27, "Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?": 27, "Very well. I am poorer for it.": 27, "Get her!": 27, "This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us.": 27, "I do. Now and forever.": 27, "This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.": 27, "What are you, some kind of tease? Stendarr's Mercy....": 27, "You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.": 27, "That's fine.": 27, "Oh. I'm sorry I said anything, then.": 27, "I don't want to see you ever again.": 27, "Better this one than me.": 27, "You should leave. Now.": 27, "Well, look at us, getting married. Life in Skyrim ain't all bad, huh?": 27, "I'm looking forward to our wedding. You and me....": 27, "I've got my hands full with something. Don't go far. I'll need you soon.": 28, "Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.": 28, "I'm disappointed in your failure. But the Empire still needs you. I'll have to over look it for now.": 28, "So be it.": 28, "Thank the Divines! Let's move!": 28, "Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital.": 28, "Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals.": 28, "Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders.": 28, "Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage.": 28, "Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.": 28, "I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.": 28, "Please get me home!": 28, "I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse.": 28, "Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward.": 28, "Good. I have some things that need doing.": 28, "Good. I can use someone I can trust.": 28, "Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.": 28, "Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude.": 28, "Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion.": 28, "Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.": 28, "I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions.": 28, "Your choice.": 28, "Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.": 28, "First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility.": 28, "First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer.": 28, "First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind.": 28, "First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out.": 28, "And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.": 28, "And then there's this Orc who's been hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.": 28, "First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.": 28, "And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.": 28, "First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in.": 28, "First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out.": 28, "First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon.": 28, "First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters.": 28, "First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them.": 28, "First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package.": 28, "And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.": 28, "First, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. We aim to confiscate it from the rebels.": 28, "First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control.": 28, "Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.": 28, "Are you here to save me?": 28, "Excellent. I have a couple tasks for you.": 28, "And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.": 28, "Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.": 28, "You've already learned all I can teach you.": 29, "You already know all that I know.": 29, "I see.": 29, "There's nothing more I can teach you.": 29, "(Deep exhale)": 30, "(Heavy breathing)": 30, "I can. It might save your life.": 30, "People say there's someone in Riften that can... change your face. Make you look completely different. Do you believe that?": 30, "(Deep breath)": 30, "Very good, ma'am.": 31, "I'm sorry, but you can't afford that right now.": 31, "Thank you! Let me know if you have anything you need from me. I'm at your service.": 31, "A fine steading like this needs a good steward. I'd be happy to take on that position, if you'd like.": 31, "Very good, I'll make all the arrangements.": 31, "I'll see to it at once.": 31, "Very good, sir.": 31, "Ha, enjoy the Chill.": 31, "I'll keep an eye out for a good cow to purchase.": 31, "Very good. I'll see about hiring a carriage driver at once.": 31, "You know Belethor's shop in Whiterun? That'd be a good place to start. He carries all sorts of things like that.": 31, "Ah. Unfortunately, I'm afraid you're a bit short of funds at the moment.": 31, "Of course. What room would you like me to furnish?": 31, "Fus!": 31, "Of course. What are we running short of?": 31, "Of course. I didn't mean to meddle in your private affairs.": 31, "Bits and Pieces in Solitude is probably the place to start. They sell all sorts of things like that.": 31, "You'll need to build a pen for it first.": 31, "I'd be honored to be your steward. You've built a fine steading here.": 31, "Ah, good. There's one I've had my eye on. I'll see if it's still for sale.": 31, "Is there anything else you need?": 31, "Certainly. I'll have it delivered to the chest near your workbenches.": 31, "Certainly. What did you have in mind?": 31, "Hmm. You might try Gray Pine Goods in Falkreath. They carry all sorts of things like that.": 31, "It would be pleasant to have some music in the house. I'll make inquiries about retaining the services of a bard.": 31, "I think you'll want a stable before we spend good coin on a horse.": 31, "You're the one who conspired with the Forsworn against Markarth! You're coming with me, murderer!": 33, "Not a chance. Not for this. You're going to the Cidhna Mine for the rest of your days.": 33, "I don't care who you're with. After what you did, you're lucky I'm not cutting you down where you stand!": 33, "I'm going to find whoever did this.": 33, "Halt. You're under arrest for murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth!": 33, "You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.": 33, "And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.": 33, "You're not sweet-talking your way out of this. Not after what you did. You're headed to Cidhna Mine, and that's that.": 33, "Fus...": 33, "It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.": 33, "Get him!": 33, "You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.": 33, "This is it men!": 34, "Okay, great!": 34, "They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead.": 34, "Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.": 34, "Yah!": 34, "My love! I knew you'd come for me! I just knew it!": 34, "Can't say I've heard of any laws against... whatever that is you're doing. But I'll lock you up if I have to.": 34, "I'm glad to see you!

Now, please put it away.": 45, "Hello friend. Make yourself at home.": 45, "Put that thing away. You're making people nervous.": 45, "You're making my patrons nervous. Put the weapon away.": 45, "Good to see you. Come on in.": 45, "I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?": 45, "If you don't mind, my patrons would appreciate it if you put the weapon away.": 45, "Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.": 45, "I trust I won't have to, but I'll bust your head in if you cause problems for my patrons.": 45, "It is making patrons nervous. It needs to put the weapon away, now.": 45, "If you cause problems, I'll have to ask you to leave.": 45, "While a good fight is always entertaining, my patrons don't like blood in their food. Put the weapon away.": 45, "If it's not too much to ask, put the weapon away? Thanks.": 45, "Lot of people looking for him.

What is it?": 46, "Hurry!": 47, "Let's see it.": 48, "No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again.": 48, "As you will.": 48, "Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.": 48, "For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.": 48, "You go on ahead.": 48, "As you command, my Thane.": 48, "You lead, I'll follow.": 48, "We heading out?": 48, "The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.": 48, "The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.": 48, "The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this.": 48, "It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.": 48, "But every now and then, one swims back.": 48, "It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.": 48, "What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.": 48, "But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.": 48, "One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped.": 48, "The prisoners just walk right out.": 48, "(growl)": 48, "Fine.": 48, "(panting)": 48, "I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.": 48, "(whine)": 48, "All right. What is it?": 48, "What do you want me to carry?": 48, "We've received a desperate missive.": 48, "I'll just be here, then.": 48, "Let's get going, then.": 48, "Waaaaah!": 48, "I will remain on guard here.": 48, "Still here.": 48, "The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.": 48, "I am at your command.": 48, "Still need me to do something?": 48, "The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.": 48, "How can I serve you, my Thane?": 48, "Ready to get going?": 48, "I'll head back home if you need me.": 48, "I've got your back.": 50, "I'm right behind you.": 50, "Good luck.": 50, "Let's go.": 50, "This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. ": 52, "Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!": 52, "This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.": 52, "But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people.": 52, "By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!": 52, "As you command.": 53, "I was just getting settled in. Where are we going?": 54, "Very well. I'll meet you there.": 54, "All right. I'll see you there.": 54, "And where would that be?": 54, "Here you are. I added a little mead into the recipe. I think it tastes better. Let me know what you think tomorrow, I'll make another one.": 54, "Then I'll see you at home!": 54, "But you have kids, right? We should find a home where we can live together.": 54, "A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed.": 54, "Is there anything you need, dearest?": 54, "Our new home. I'll see you there!": 54, "You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think.": 54, "Oh, but... you have children, don't you? We'll have to find somewhere with room for them.": 54, "It's good to see you again, dear.": 54, "We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course.": 54, "We should find a place with room for your kids, though.": 54, "You're going? I'll miss you, dear.": 54, "A home for the two of us. I'll meet you there.": 54, "Ah, it's my love, come to visit.": 54, "Here. Wouldn't want you going into a fight on an empty stomach. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.": 54, "Yes, my love? What do you need?": 54, "Here. This is from a recipe my people have passed on to me. I can cook another tomorrow.": 54, "What do you need, love? Ask anything.": 54, "Here, this is fresh. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.": 54, "I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store.": 54, "It will be our little nest. I'll be waiting for you there.": 54, "Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!": 54, "Good to see you, dear.": 54, "It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road.": 54, "Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet.": 54, "Conquer your enemies, my love.": 54, "The two of us, living together. I'll see you at home!": 54, "It's pleasing to see you again.": 54, "Hello, dear. I haven't been drinking too much, if that's what you're thinking.": 54, "Goodbye, my love.": 54, "You want to move? Where?": 54, "Leaving? Take the world by storm, dearest.": 54, "Speak. You can ask anything of me, love.": 54, "If that's what you want. I'll see you there, soon.": 54, "I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me.": 54, "You have children, though, don't you? We'll have to find somewhere with room for them, too.": 54, "Do you need anything, my love?": 54, "I'll be here if you need me, love.": 54, "I'll be here, my dear.": 54, "I'll see you there, then.": 54, "I'll see you at home, then. Don't keep me waiting!": 54, "I'll be waiting for you at home, then.": 54, "I'll get everything ready and meet you there.": 54, "Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away.": 54, "I should be asking you the same question, but all right. I'll cook. Here, try this, and don't you dare ask for another one before tomorrow.": 54, "A warrior marches on the gut. Here. This should give you strength. I'll cook another tomorrow.": 54, "Oh really? And where were you thinking?": 54, "You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.": 54, "Lead on.": 54, "Where?": 54, "I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.": 54, "I love you. You know that, right?": 54, "This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?": 54, "Where are you thinking?": 54, "This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out.": 54, "Yes, love?": 54, "Bye, love.": 54, "Lead the way.": 54, "I'll see you there.": 55, "Oh? Where?": 55, "All right.": 57, "Right, then.": 57, "I'll meet you there.": 59, "I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.": 60, "When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go.
